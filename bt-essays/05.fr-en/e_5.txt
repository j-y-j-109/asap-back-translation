In Joe Kurmaskie's "Do Not Exceed The Posted Speed Limit" story, depending on how the main character feels, this is what the frame looks like. When he got to the next town and left he felt good because everything was fine. The setting was very peaceful. The narrator says, "The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it" (Kurmaskie). This setting was very happy and pleasant as was the atmosphere of the narrators.

Some things that affected the rider were the terrain which turned into a flat road which was replaced by short rolling hills. Then he found himself on a rough road. Another obstacle for the cyclist was the tar-like substance coming out of the rusty water pump, followed by a feeling of brackish water somewhere at NUM1 hundred degrees. Every time it pumped it didn't cool down and the water tasted like battery acid. He regularly banged his water bottle, which is why he needed new water. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California and the sun was starting to hit, so he was dehydrated.      The snake blocked the sidewalk in front of him which looked like a diamond back.

The characteristics of the environment affect the cyclist in the new "Do not exceed the posted speed limit". Being the start of summer in Southern California, the temperatures are going to be hot. And the main character, who is a cyclist and does a lot of physical activity, is going to sweat a lot. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the rider to drink a lot of water. The water is flowing and we are now in our conflict. The frame also reads the main character on his conflict resolution. Being by a reserve, fishing is going to be a popular activity. A bait and tackle store would be the ideal business, because over there that is at the bait and tackle store, the cyclist could go and quench his thirst. Therefore, the affect frame of the story affects the conflict and the solution.

The cyclist decided to head to Yosemite National Park on a hot summer day in California. His first instinct was to use a perfectly good and up-to-date map. Then he started having a conversation with an old me who decided they would tell him a shortcut they had taken that day. The cyclist decided to take the old men's shortcut across the desert with a dirty water bottle. It was very hot outside and the sun was beating on his back while he was riding his bike. It made him hotter than him ??? and there was no shade for him to cover and take water. This made the trip more difficult for him as he was now focused on finding water and not on his journey. The parameters of the cause affected the cyclist in many ways, he was not prepared for the route and the route he took was not suitable for cyclists. If he had taken the route shown on the map he would have known where he was and his route would not have been affected by thoughts of slowing down to put stones in the butterfly to reserve water or thoughts to find water, he would have

The cyclist has experienced difficult times. The elements were against him. It was dry and hot and there was no water. In the text it says: “The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. This shows that he had hardly any water, and what he had would only make him thirsty. “@ CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake.” It obviously wasn't and the quote maker is visualizing you a desert or a colorado. The man was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. He saved his energy and his water. He was starting to get a little crazy. The hills were a slaughter for him, in the text it says "on a long crippling hill". This show now shows you the rough conditions because he told us at the beginning that he is a cyclist.

Time can change the heart of a cyclist's action. If it is cold outside, the rider will bring Beveyer cloths if it is. Warmer outside, he would probably bring lighter clothes. If he went further, he would bring more provisions like water and food. If he left for a short trip, he wouldn't bring so many things. The weather changes the way a person will prepare,

When he starts he doesn't even notice how hot it is and he says, “ The race was starting to get down, but I barely noticed it. " His mood began to change very quickly. Soon he drinks most of his water and becomes more and more tired. He finds a water pump that pisses him off when he realizes the water tastes like "battery acid". As he continues, he sees a snake that he could swear was a diamond, so he slowly walks away. When he sees a factory, he uses his last energy to reach it, but is discouraged when he finds it abandoned. His spirits finally come back when he finds a store and drinks a fair amount of water.

The cyclist of this news was greatly affected by the setting. He was driving in a very hot desert, with little civilization to help him. Also, the ride we were riding was not very smooth, which caused him problems. Wildlife also had an impact on him. Once he walked past a large snake that he had to carefully walk around. He also thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to take him away. The desert itself was what really touched him. The deserts don't have much water which is what he needed and he couldn't find a town to stop at, at least one with some people anyway.

Being a cyclist is not as easy as it seems. Sure, riding a bike can be easy, but being a cyclist is so much harder. Cyclists have many obstacles to overcome while riding. An obstacle would be rough terrain. Cyclists are used to riding on smooth, paved roads. Getting off the road or riding on a dirt road can be a challenge. In the new "Do Exceed Posted Speed Limit", Joe Kurmaskie also another example for a cyclist obstacles which must be taken, and it is running out of water, "I went smoothly, trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state ”(@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). The rider went on to say that he had to try to keep his balance, but it was difficult because he was dehydrated, and the balance is Important when riding a bicycle In conclusion, when it comes to as simple as riding a bicycle, you need to be careful about what could happen to you.

The setting affects the rider in several ways. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert-like terrain leaves him very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is difficult to pedal, and the endless expanses of land make it feel like the next town is years away. While traveling, the cyclist recalls: “At one point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake. blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me ”(Kurmaskie, @ NUM1). The tumbleweeds are a symbol of the dry death of the desert. They remind the cyclist that he is completely alone in a vast expanse of sand and rocks. If the snake on the path poisoned him, he wouldn't just be under the bright sunshine until another unhappy cyclist found him. However, later, when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber's fishing camp, hope returns. He's determined again as he's waiting somewhere near the water he needs to keep him alive.

Another example is, “ At one point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really looked like a diamond back - blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me. " This has affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake moves that do not bite as he crossed it. A final example is, " As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to look for @ PERSON1 and Wilber" This had an effect on the cyclist because he was now happy to have water and to have reached his destination.

Every field the author entered changed how he felt and lived. At first, his entourage gives him courage. As he passes through the first city, abandoned and empty, he is still confident that he can continue to fight against the lush green trees and cool rivers around him that belied the scorching sun above him. They are basically the reason he kept on going. Later, during her trek through the desolate and desolate wilderness, her dark surroundings make her feel hopeless and hopeless. Even in the small details, like the ghost town or the pump, it's fucked up, because the ghost town brings him the first vestige of desperation, and the unnecessary pomp only amplifies it.

It's spectacle when he says. The cool, rushing rivers of Yosemite have my name written all over them. It shows confidence as he knows he can get to yosemite. When he runs out of water, he begins to lose confidence and thinks he is going to die. Since he ran out of water due to the heat, his energy is also diminished. You know he's running out of water when he says, "The water bottle only contained a few mouthwatering sips." @ CAPS1, after a loss of water and confidence; he actually had a greater determination to go to Yosemite.

Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: An example in the old men who give him advice.

In California, @ DATE1 in the dessert will give you a lot of heat. To beat this heat, you need a lot of water, which is one of its biggest problems. There is a lack of water. Another embarrassing thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a photo of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice.

Go up and down hills and pedal very hard. He doesn't even have fresh water.

In the desert, there is no water which dehydrates the cyclist. without water he thought he was going to die. In highway areas, the speed limits were extremely high at fifty-five miles per hour. It would not be good since it makes "a @ NUM1 which depletes water". When he finds abandoned areas, they are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @ MONTH1 is water, but it tastes like "battery acid". The setting can affect a lot in the story.

In history, there were many characteristics of the frame that affected the rider. The one that had the most impact was that it was hot and dry, and the terrain was very rough in the desert.

The sun is beating down like your only person on the planet. Lack of water the food it has not rained for decades. The Endless Road @ CAPS1. The ups and downs and all the animals that await her.

The scenery countries that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and the hills. The author first tells us about his depleted water supply as he travels through the high deserts of California in June. “The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, its limited water, and the fact that it was June. I am sure the author was very happy to travel during his intensive trip. Another misfortune that the author explains is the change of tour. This road has been replaced by a multitude of hills. “With my own experience, I know these can't be worse. The high, steep hills are a tough climb, but your residential home is the most luxurious for cooling off. In his mind too, with the author's " short rolling hills " the climb becomes more and more miserable with each hill, and the coast on the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your vivacious soul to continue. in this deep pain.

The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @ NUM1. It was hitting the water quite regularly and the scorching sun was hitting it. The next pitch changed, he thought that he would die and the vultures pluck his bones because he had followed the advice of the elders, then became his next stop which appeared to be a former welch grape juice factory.

For example, the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling with nothing in sight. In twenty miles he saw the camp ?? a ?? that he was thirsty and that he had holes. When he pumped the water, no outlet. This part of the frame gave a bad effect to the cyclist. The cyclist gave "teaches that life can be so cruel". He obviously had a bad effect if he thought life was cruel. He is able to die of thirst when he sees a bait shop. This puts the rider in a good mood because he said "my problems are thirsty and feel it all behind me".

The setting affected the rider because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For example when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it says "the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills". Also, the heat helped a lot and it was there all the time. Sometimes he didn't seem to notice or feel it, but it was there and it took energy: like when he said, "The sun was starting to hit, but I barely noticed it." He didn't know it, but it took him so he drank more water and it affected his ability to take in enough to complete the ride.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. He still held his head up high and was determined to reach his destination. The first problem was when it came to " fork of sorts " as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tar-like substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn't. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to go in search of another water supply. Another problem that occurred was, as he got more and more dehydrated by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to go around it slowly, although it was difficult, he succeeded and continued down the road. The third "hurdle" he encountered was that he was so thirsty and finally got a drink, when to his disappointment he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervous and overwhelming as he was, he kept moving forward, still determined to reach his destination. He finally made it to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and have a nice drink! Even though the setting was harsh, teasing and ironic, the man managed to pull through and always with a smile on his face.

The characteristics of the tuning affect the rider by the changes that occur while riding his bicycle. The rider started off well with a smiley face but then changed due to the condition of the road and the hot weather plus there was no signal to show him where he was going and it was the right one path he was taking. In addition, his flat bike needed to be replaced.

The frame of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From start to finish, the outside world mirrors the torment in his head. This is evident in the starting tank, the empty desert, the hills of the Welch factory and finally the fishing camp. The reservoir is safe ground, @ NUM1 that contains everything men need. He feels optimistic, ready and willing to follow the advice of old people. It first hits a ghost town, which foreshadows a dangerous future. He still holds his head held high. He arrives at a water pump which gives him battery acid. This is where the mood changes. He suddenly describes his surroundings as "the high deserts of California". The sun is boiling and the water is weak. His hopes start to crumble. When the “flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,” it reflected the commotion in his head. The harder terrain is the chances of its survival lessons. When he comes across a snake, it suggests even more despair. It finally culminates at the Welch factory. How ironic, this is an abandoned juice factory. It is a lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fishing camp, he is relieved to be alive and raised. The cyclist succeeded. It is clear that the setting affected the rider.

He already had problems with thirst and had to deal with a snake that "really looked like a diamond back". @ CAPS2, he sees a building being constructed and discovers that it is a walrus grape juice factory. He thought he might have some water but found he was abandoned. Regarding his thirst, before leaving, he caught some stones. I once read that sucking on rocks helps quench thirst by letting your remaining saliva flow through. * @ CAPS3, he stumbled upon a fishing camp and received instructions on how to continue.

The author was touched in many ways ie the conclusion. He was tired from the scorching heat, didn't have much water, and got lost. Simple water was limiting and as he went further and further it seemed like things were going to get worse for him. A man had given him the wrong directions and he probably hadn't been out of his porch in decades, the author said.

In history, there are many elements that have affected the cyclist in his journey. The first features of the decor that affect it are the old water pump, which did not work, and when it did work, the water coming out of it lasted horribly. The next obstacles on his journey were rough terrain. "The flat road has been replaced by short hills", so he described it. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be abandoned. Eventually, he finds a city and rests after his long journey, and learns his lesson from before so as not to take advice from people he doesn't know.

“Within two miles of the next section of the trip, I noticed the terrian was changing. The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills '' (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). When the cyclist realized that the terrain was getting rough, he became more ignorant and desperate. Large rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day just because I was listening to gentlemen who hadn't stepped out of their porch in decades made me laugh. it was a sad, desperate laugh '' (@ NUM1). He wasn't going to die, die but even if he struggled, he made a big deal out of it. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live, telling people not to listen to old people. "Never accept travel advice from a collection of elders who have not left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office" (@ NUM3). He was on a long hot road and he started stabbing the old men. In his selfishness to cut this trip down to only a few rugged terrain, the heat and dehydration made him desperate, angry, and he felt sorry for himself.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. One way is for the cyclist to travel through the high deserts of California in June. Another effect said in the story was that the cyclist went to a town where the water pump was all rusty and with all his might he worked the handle and got a tarry substance followed by brackish water that 'he couldn't drink. In addition, the cyclist regularly banged his water bottles. Finally, the ancients said that cities would be close when in reality they were far away.

There are a lot of things that can affect a cyclist's ride. This cyclist seemed to have a bad wick. He starts off by mentioning that he's planning a trip to Yosemite and the men who hear that tip him. The rider is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions. He ends up getting lost. The cyclist also travels to the “high deserts of California in June”. This means that he travels in the summer with dry air. When he arrives at the first "city" he sees, he can get the water he needs to rehydrate his body. He also encounters a snake while crossing the desert, which slows him down. Because it is hot and he is tired, he begins to see mirages that affect him. All of these features force cyclists to take a long and tiring journey through the desert. These characteristics have also taught him the lesson not to take advice from old men who have not left their porch because their @ MONTH1 information is out of date.

In Joe Kurmaskie's “ Rough Road Ahead : Staying within the Posted Speed Limit ”, the characteristics of the setting affect the main characters, the cyclist. After leaving the house where he first met the old men, he walked through very flat desert terrain, where the sun beat him and dehydrated him. Soon, although the terrain has changed. “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills.

Hot, @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2-all are the characteristics of the setting that affect the rider. First of all, hot days with little water to drink. He will become dehydrated. Plus, there's no one to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains “that there was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.

In the story " Rough Road Ahead ", a cyclist takes the wrong rate information from a couple of old guys while following the instructions, he discovered that these instructions were wrong and dangerous in some places. Also, the setting didn't help as it was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot, it didn't help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example, in the story, when he enters the fork in the road, it is said that he found "several rusty pumps" and "a dilapidated shed". It probably didn't help him as he didn't have much water left and it was very hot and he was losing confidence in himself that he was out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn't get water that was good. Also in the story it is said that " There was no one in sight, no building, car or structure of any kind " and this setting affected him because in this part of the world. story, he rode a bicycle for a while and he has no water. left and he's very exhausted and has hardly any energy left. Also, it lowered his hopes as it said there was no building or car, so it was more of an empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn't settle for the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story "Rough road ahead" the frame of the story did not help the cyclist in his hope or his confidence to leave because the frame was very abandoned and also it was very hot and that did not help let him be in a desert.

Well, since the cyclist is in a desert and out of mum he is probably not going to be happy. The "ghost towns" are not a real sign of confidence either. The rugged hills angered him too. The heat affected him the most.

The characteristics of the terrain affect the rider in several ways. For example, the first two buildings he visited were abandoned and he was therefore unable to obtain food or water. In addition, he noticed that the terrain changed from flat to rolling hills and this will put more strain on his legs. Finally, the earth was hot and dry which made him dehydrate. This is how the characteristics of the terrain affected the cyclist.

In this story, the frame affects the rider in several ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didn't know what they were talking about. That is why you have to be careful who you ask. Then it needs a drink, but it works great as the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist resumes his road and finds the same difficulty on the road. The same difficulty on the road. The road is in poor condition and must go slower than the speed limit. At this point, he felt like he was going to die. Fortunately, he found a bathroom and drank from the sink.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. At the start of the essay, the syclist states that he "enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening and a heated conversation with these old weirdos." The rider was having fun and enjoying the atmosphere, but the mood quickly changed to doubt when he did not listen to the ' collection of elders who have not left the confines of their porches since Carter was in power ”and his depleting water source quickly became a cause for concern. The doubt was quickly followed by @ CAPS1 when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber's fish camp and was able to have a drink in the bathroom whips. [the very good card] in the future.

The setting had a bad effect on the author in many ways. One reason is that the heat from the socket caused the perpetrator to dehydrate. Dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water. The executive also affected him by draining his confidence and making him fetch water. " I bowed my head " means he was depressed. It proves that no matter who or what you follow, there is always the possibility of death under any circumstance. So this is how the author was affected by the setting he was doing on the bike @ CAPS1.

I think the settings made it a little harder not to give up as well. Also shows that you are more successful in life when challenged.

The setting affects the rider as he is in a hot, dry climate, causing him to sweat profusely, and requiring more water to drink. When there was no one else around, it is more difficult for him to continue, if there is a chance that he is on the wrong track and no body is available to tell him the opposite. With only abandoned buildings, if any, water was not available, making the trip more tiring and physically taxing. If the setting had been different, this story wouldn't have been so traumatic.

THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE FRAMEWORK THAT AFFECTS THE RIDER. IN MANY WAYS, A FEATURE WOULD BE THE "SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT" BECAUSE IT MAKES THE RIDER HOT AND THIRSTY. THIRST REDUCES HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED WATER SUPPLY. THEREFORE THE SUN COULD ACHIEVE IT IN MANY WAYS. ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE RIDER WERE THE DROPPED “FANTASY TOWNS” CONSISTING OF “RAM-SHACKLE HANGAR” AND “SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS”. THESE FEATURES CAUSED THE RIDER TO FEEL DESPAIR, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY HAVE NO SHOWS TO FEEL WHEN HE BECOME DEHYDRATED. OBSTACLES SUCH AS "TUMBLEWEEDS" AND "SNAKES BLOCKING PAVERS" ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN AFFECTING RIDERS WHEN MOVING ON "ROUTE @ NUM1" DOING ONLY "12 MPH". A LAST AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN ON WHICH IT RIDED.

Subject: The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. The characteristics of the frame affect a cyclist or the major problem a cyclist encounters is a rough road, inspecting the bike, putting on the necessary equipment, not exceeding the posted speed limit For a cyclist doing all of this, I don't think there are going to be all characteristics of the environment affecting a cyclist. For a cyclist who maintains the speed limit of @ NUM1 or a @ NUM2 who depletes the water: sometimes life can seem so cruel. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much speed, but in order for them to use the necessary equipment, they won't be seriously injured. Forget that old adage that says never take candy from strangers. No, better advice for the solo cyclist would be " Never agree to

The characteristics of the frame really affected the rider. The author wrote about rugged terrain and isolation. "Flat roads have been replaced by short rolling hills, tumbleweeds have crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake." After reading this information and descriptions. I deduced that the author was alone in the desert with horrible conditions. I'll infer a tone of resentment too. He seemed to wish he hadn't taken the "short cut" that had led him into the desert. Hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned the duration of the journey and how to conserve water. The desolation of the rough terrain and the warm temperatures seemed to have affected the rider / author.

The frame features that most affected the rider were the water pump, the Welch factory, and the fishing lodge. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to have water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, like he wrote, "with all my might". @ CAPS1, he must have continued to be thirsty (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because "he tasted like battery acid". Then, Welch's Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He already felt bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking and ironic image of "a shortbread picture of a young boy pouring himself a refreshing glass of juice" made him feel even worse. . It reflected his own desperate situation, all the refreshments of the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am allergic to peanuts. Once, on a long road trip, I slept over lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to see. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant : The Peanut Shade from @ CAPS2. I almost cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fishing camp. It saved his life. He arrived and "drank deeply of sinle. He was so happy that he wanted to hug the owners of the camp.This also relates to the car ride I mentioned, because after hours of hunger we found a really good sush: bar, and sush: c ' is my favorite food.

In the background, they are in Lodi, California. It is a part of the desert. The desert really affects the cyclist. On the one hand, it's really hot. Two the heat makes him thirsty and lacks water. Finally, it is not close to any city, so it cannot have any more water, so the setting affects the rider.

The cyclist is the most affected by the heat. He is deploying all his energy and willpower to get to Yosemite. The scorching sun and lack of water make him very tired and force him to use his energy inefficiently. At some point, he has to make sure the building is a mirage. It's so hot her mind might be playing tricks on her.

The conditions the cyclist was in were very horrible as he continued his race, it got hotter and hotter in the hope of finding water after finishing his last bit. Following an old man's advice was and his last decision he made.

The characteristics of the frame affect the cyclist because sometimes it makes him lose a little courage and optimism. “and the growing awareness that I might fall from heatstroke on a beautiful day.” This is one example of how he lost heart. I wanted to be brave and strong. But the hot day and all the sweat weakened the author. “ I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean, leaving only expensive outdoor gear. ” This is an example of how the author has lost some optimism. He didn't want to die, but he kept telling himself he was going to do it, he should have told himself he was going to get there, but the setting was just too harsh. There were bumps along his way, and the sun beating his thirst, he became less courageous and less optimistic.

The features of his journey are cruel. "The rolling hills" make him work harder to overcome them. The more he works, the more he sweats and therefore he needs fluids to do so. The lack of water he has does not help. The poisons don't really bother him if he leaves alone. The state of the roads adds to the hills. Bumpy roads make him work hard to cross and then over hills. So this guy is getting pretty tough.

Some of the frame features that affected the rider were the rough terrain and the hills. It is said in the reading " the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills ", it would exhaust a person without a good supply of water and not know which direction they are moving. And another thing that affects him is the hot June weather in California.

Throughout “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit ”, the characteristics of the setting affect the rider. The cyclist was passing through a very dry area, where it was very hot, dry and dangerous. There was no water to find and the terrain was rough and bumpy. The speaker said: “At one point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake…” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The cyclist faced blockades in the terrain and dangerous animals. This makes it slow down a bit. It was absolutely not in the frame it was in. The cyclist was in the deserts of California in June. He stated : "@ CAPS1 of dried sweat rings encircling my shirt, the growing awareness that I could get a heat stroke on beautiful June day ..." (Kurmaskie @ NUM1).

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. He gets delusional when he says that if he was lucky one of the stones would get lodged in his throat. Plus, he's dehydrated because he uses all his water and has to push hard to get to the next town.

In the story "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted limit", the characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider. While riding, he was crossing the desert in June, a very hot month. There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, especially in the normal June sun, it might run out of water. If he had walked through, say, a forest or maybe some rolling meadows, he might not have been in such danger and could have just looked for water in a river or stream if he was desperate. . Another thing that could have affected the cyclist would have been the effect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts, they often think of dry, barren wasteland, with buzzards and maybe a dead cow's skull, like in the movies. Deserts are intimidating, they have a bad reputation and then, as he crossed and ran out of water, he thought of death as he was, "going to die and the birds would pick him up cleanly" as he walked across his river. now terrified. to manage. If he had been in a city or in hilly farmland, he might not have been so terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe, but in his wilderness he had neither, allowing him to surrender to despair. The setting influences the stories a lot, so it's important to keep this in mind when reading.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider as he was out of water in a desert environment and there was no terrain for the most part so he was alone. The cyclist was affected when in the story he said: “ I got on all fours, running the water handle of the rusty water pump with all my might. A tar-like substance oozed out, followed by a sensation of brackish water around two hundred degrees. This affected him because he was drinking a lot of water before getting to this point in his trip and he was almost out, so he needed to fill up with water but he didn't have a place. to get more water. It is one of the characteristics of the decor that touched him.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider by becoming dehydrated, tired and lost. After the cyclist had been on the road for a while, he had drunk most of his water, but still had some time to go before he got to his destination. He was going to try to find a place to stop so that he could collect more water, but there was nothing around. He was also tired because he was in the sun, didn't have barley water, and didn't know where he was going. A final example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people. So if he had been injured or sick, no one could have helped him. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired and getting lost were the characteristics of the environment that the cyclist had.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as he lacks water because he is trying to cross the terrain. In the background, there is a desert in California that he crosses by bicycle, "I was traveling through the high deserts of California" The word "high" means that there were hills which would make the journey even more difficult. The hills appeared later in history when the cyclist said that "the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills". When the speaker says replaced, he is trying to show a change of pitch. Another characteristic of the decor is the tumbleweed that it crosses other hills, "tumbleweeds cross in path". The tumbleweeds reminded him that he was in the wilderness because tumbleweeds are associated with the wilderness, which caused thought, death, and being picked up by birds.

Well, if the frame relates to the theme then the story will make sense, like it's a sad story and it's a lousy rainy day, then that would match up really well. This is how the tuning makes it better.

If it's hot, you can get dehydrated quickly. also, if it is very hilly, you consume a lot of energy. It can harm the equipment, body and mind. Make sure you dress appropriately and carry plenty of water. Next, make sure your tire is inflated and all equipment is working properly. then plan a good route that you can stop at places and catch your breath or some water. also, be sure to eat well, food provides a lot of energy.

As part of the test ; "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit." had a great effect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the pitch was so difficult to cross. For example : “ At one point weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake - it really looked like a diamond behind most of the sidewalk in front of me, I walked smoothly, trying to keep my balance in my. state of dehydration. "The author describes in detail how, whatever the obstacles he encounters, he keeps trying to let go. Terrain affects the character in the determined keeping. This happens to many people in their sports. For example, in soccer they take all the problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game.

In the story, the cyclist was hit. The cyclist was affected by the old man's directions. They gave it to him to help him. That it was a shortcut. I think the cyclsit thinks the instructions are out of date. The reason is that in the second sentence of the story it says, "Never accept travel advice from a collection of elders who have not left their porch since Carter took office." . The peculiarity of the surroundings also affected him because he had to climb up and down through what he considered to be rough terrain. This is what I think affected the rider.

In Joe Kurmaskie's "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit", the characteristics of the setting affect the rider a lot. The terrain has a lot to do with it. Also, the heat: First, the terrain affects the cyclist. It affects the rider because there are a lot of hills. The text reads: "With what I thought was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill." To go down a hill, you had to have climbed a hill. So having to use the energy to pedal in the hills affected the rider a lot. Then the heat affected the cyclist. I know this because the text says "and the growing awareness that I might fall from heat stroke. It proves that it is extremely hot outside. The heat would affect the rider as the heat keeps you from riding. operate to the maximum of your ability. This is how the features of the setting in " Do not exceed posted speed limit " affect the rider. Terrain affects the rider because of the hills. The heat because it drains your energy quickly.

In “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit ”, the characteristics of the setting affect the rider in several ways. One of the reasons it affected him was that the towns were old and deserted. In the story he said, "This place could have been a small, prosperous place… but @ CAPS1 it was a ghost town." He couldn't get water or directions. The characteristics of the setting affected the rider as the roads were bumpy and there were many hills. “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills. » @ CAPS1 the cyclist had to use all his power to maneuver on the hills. The third reason the setting affected the rider was the weather and the fact that it was a desert. "I was traveling through the deserts of California in June." He was hot, sweaty and thirsty. He was also tired and desperate to find water and a city that was not deserted. The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit", by roads, deserted towns and lack of water.

In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, he describes his experience biking in the desert. The frame affects the rider in several ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old men give him advice. The setting is calm and cheerful and Kurmaskie writes that he "enjoyed the serenity of a summer evening". The word "serenity" conveys the effect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie moves forward on his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the "dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't contain the most crappy mule" in a ghost town he encounters in the desert. Still later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign that says " Rough Road Ahead ". Kurmaskie's confidence turns to even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs out. Finally, kurmaskie sees a sign indicating a fishing camp. Here, his hope returns when he finds a " rather modern bathroom " where he can stop for a drink. As the frame changes, Kurmaskie's confidence is followed by determination and then relief.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as it is in a place like a dessert with a wave of water and he might get tired. I would never have asked old people, he should have asked someone who was in charge of a store, because these people are interviewed many times. also he could have died if this snake had had it or what he said "heat stroke".

The story begins as the author, a cyclist, followed the instructions of several very old men to reach his destination by bicycle, Yosemite National Park. He starts out quite confident and then reaches the first town described by the gentleman. It is a ghost town and amuses the author to still believe that he is doing perfectly well, this time he leaves, arriving at a place with "A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that could not fit in the mule the most zero ". point that the author begins to worry because his water supply is low. It passes hills, snakes, tumbleweeds, and various landmarks. Each is tearing their confidence and excitement to shreds. Especially the juice factory because the author is currently very dehydrated and is losing all hope. Finally, he arrives at the water he seeks in the form of " Gary Wilber's Fish Camp " and cools off along with his withered hope. Every time the author turned a corner, his self-confidence took a hit, and even though he was in poor physical health, having no hope for his sunny and windy vacation can drain a person even more of the interior.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in a negative way as he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no rocks to have a drink. any kind. This explains how his surroundings affected him as he had nowhere to go or have a drink. This is my reason why the rider's settings were negative.  

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in a negative way. The rocky road and steep hills made it more difficult. The old men made him take the rocky path. The desert temperature made him thirsty, so he quickly ran out of water. The heat could have killed him anytime. For example, “ Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that I might fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day. " This trip the man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous path.         

<START>

 

The adjustment can greatly affect the rider. The place can change what happens and how it happens. For example, if the story had taken place in Alaska, the cyclist would not have had " Large rings of sweat encircling my shirt ." and instead fought hypothermia. The setting is very important because it affects all the details of the writing.      

<START>

 

At the start, the ground was good and he was confident. But when he reached the first town, it looked like one of those ghost towns in the movies. The next town didn't come when told it would. The terrain was like a desert without water for miles. But he remained determined. And he made it to a little water though.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting affected the rider in " Do not exceed posted speed limit ". For example, he finds a "dilapidated shed" and tries to find water. It affected him, for it is written, “I got on all fours, pulling the handle of the rusty water pump with all my might. A tar-like substance leaked out, followed by a sensation of brackish water around two hundred degrees. The quote signifying that he was determined to find water and maybe anything.      

<START>

 

The adjustment affected the rider by depriving them of hydration and weakening them. The great hills and bumpy roads flowed back to the end of his strength and exhausted him. The narration says, "On a long crippling hill" (kurmaskie @ NUM1). This choice of work reflects the writer's feeling of his adventure. Words like " long " and " crippling " show that the trip was a horrible experience.        

<START>

 

Pride, determination, relief - all are things that the cyclist felt during his long cycling. First of all, the cyclist began to ride on fresh legs and in good directions, but after some time on the road he began to give the old men, "a diary with my last entry in place of the old men, their wisdom and sense of direction, I made a mental movement to change it. After feeling that steering might be difficult, he rode out of pride to get to his destination. Then the rider was determined to reach his destination and did a lot of things, “ I gathered some pebbles and put them in my mouth to distract myself from thirst .” This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going. Finally, the rider was tired when he got to shop @ CAPS1 because he knew then the old men were right and would reach his destination ... get water but know the men were right.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the decor affect the cyclist when he is thirsty. "A shortbread photo of a young boy pouring a glass of refreshing juice into his mouth could be seen." This proves that the runner was thirsty because in the previous paragraph, it is about him having a last burst of energy while going down a hill. And he was also sweating a lot. And also wiping the sweat from his eyes.    

<START>

 

I work best when I can feel the surroundings. I think the few go for cycling in the mountains, the fresh air and no worries about you bother them the bike can become fun like the climates in the easy, it even looks fresh, the beautiful trees and the environment makes him feel better therefore for the cycling environment plays a vital role.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in a major way. The tuning affected the rider's performance. For example, the severe temperature began to make her pedaling slow. The settings also scared the rider a bit, for example the rider ran into a snake he was terrified of. Here again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. For example, the river prompted the cyclist to stop riding and go for a drink of water. In conclusion, the frame had a major effect on the rider.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. On the one hand, a lot of parameters discouraged the cyclist. “This place might have been a prosperous little place at one time - let's say, before the last world war - but that morning it met the traditional definition of a ghost town. As soon as the cyclist reaches this "city", he realizes that the advice of the elders may not have been so good. The dry desert affects the cyclist the most. This hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirsty, hot and sweaty. "Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt, and the growing awareness that I might fall from heatstroke ..." The cyclist's air here is sarcastic but he is still concerned about his health because of heat and lack of water. The fact that there is nothing alive around the rider also affects him. Since speaking to the old men for directions, he hasn't seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything. This therefore definitely discourages the cyclist and makes him lose the desire to continue his journey. In conclusion, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways.          

<START>

 

The cyclist traveled through arid land trying to reach a land of rivers and valleys. While driving through the first town, the cyclist saw a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps, and a corral located in the California desert. The cyclist was very angry that the old men had driven him to this barren town, but he kept his hopes up and went to the next town. Their, he found an abandoned juice factory and bottling plant, how the cyclist began to give up. “I was going to die,” he shouted with all hopes of the booty. Man has the impression that they have nothing left and that it is the old people who caused it. Then finally he came across a bait shop which he found his own giving him enormous relief. The features affect his attitude because in an arid country, you lose hope like the cyclist. Hence, what surrounds us affects us like education, friendship and survival.

In the test " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the rider is affected emotionally and physically by the characteristics of the frame. At first, when he came to a deserted shed with rusty pumps, he began to feel disheartened. "[The] sight was disturbing", (page @ NUM1) @ CAPS1 in the trial, the terrain changed from flat terrain to short rolling hills and tumbleweeds started to pass. The cyclist is definitely affected by the change of terrain. He is now exhausted but continues to pump his legs and keep rolling. Before the end of his race, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ ORGANIZATION1. The frame includes a large image of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost detected by this. " I bowed my head " (page @ NUM2), he confessed. Ultimately, once he finds an old fisherman's shop, he is relieved to see the shop from afar turning the author on, because he could finally have a drink. The author's mood and body were greatly affected by these features of the setting.

The characteristics of the scenery in Joe Kurmaskie's " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " show that as the day goes on, the cyclist becomes tired and exhausted from his long run over rough terrain trying to find his way home, then he saw buildings fall down a hill and said "With what I thought was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill" (kurmakie @ NUM1). Once the runner gets home he says he will do it again.   

<START>

 

The main effect is the lack of water. It's June, while he's riding his bike in California. It will therefore be very hot and he will need a lot of water to stay hydrated. When he sees that Welch grape juice factory, it makes him think of his thirst even more. In addition, the terrain on which it rolls is not the easiest. It starts to ride on level ground, but then it climbs over hills and on less level ground. It does not help his dehydration. This is why you should always take plenty of water with you if you are cycling in the summer.       

<START>

 

The effects of the settings were the heat and the cycling route it was on. The biker said it was June, summer, very hot. And the roads were not smooth, they were very old and rough.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as he tries to go up and down hills which can be very tiring. In addition, hot air can dehydrate it, which can cause it to pass out. In addition to dry air, there is dry land, which means there is no place to stop for water or a @ CAPS1. The Rough @ CAPS2 makes cycling naRaeR because it involves more energy than cycling on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the middle of the road forced the biker to go around. If the snake had bitten him, he could have died of poison.

The frame of the " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " test was very hot in a dry place, with very little shade or humidity, at one time maybe not even at all. More and more dehydrated he moved forward.

How the characteristics of the frame affected the rider. The feature was that you should never take advice from old people who never leave the house. For example, in the story it says, “ Never accept travel advice from the collection of elders. times that haven't left their porches since Carter came to power. It affected the frame because if it hadn't been for her card and letting them take a look at it, it would have saved her a lot of trouble.

In "Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" Joe Kurmaskie, the ground was hot and the water flowed. In the text, it is written " Followed by a sensation of blackish water around two hundred degrees ", this proves that the cyclist exaggerates the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The scenery is also draining of water and had to stop in the desert town to fill his water bottle as in the text says "I got on all fours, working the handle of a rusty water pump with all my might ". This proves that the rider had to stop to fetch water and use a lot of energy to pump it. In conclusion, always prepare for the worst but hope for the best.      

<START>

 

In history, many characteristics of the frame affect the rider. A setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for the water. For example, in the story it says: “On top of a long crippling hill, a building appeared. This shows that the hill was very difficult and arduous to cross. Using the word crippling, he informs us that the hill was brutal and very difficult to cross. Another parameter that I present that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycle path. While driving, he notices that there is no one to help him if he has problems or needs water. The absence of people makes him stressed and worried about his trip. This shows it in the story when he says, "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." It is also said in the story " I was going to die and the bird would pick me up clean, leaving only expensive door clothes and a journal with the last entry on the analysis of the old men ". It shows that there was no one around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and the birds would eat him. He was stubbornly worried about the absence of people.            

<START>

 

Usually the characteristics, the setting have a major effect on the rider. The characteristics, the setting relate and describe the chopping and, optionally, the state of relief of the cyclist. The frame is about the person and plays a role that the rider can observe. One of the reasons that the frame characteristics affect the rider is because it shows the various issues that the rider faces. For example, cool pines, no one in sight, and I am alone. The way that makes sense, I the cyclist needs help getting home, and possibly while traveling, he needs water, to quench his thirst. Before that, the features show the weakness of the cyclist. For example, with that, I thought it was my last burst of energy, as I purposely maneuvered down the hill. The characteristics and settings affect the rider by showing how he coped with his problems, thirst and fear, which all lead him behind in the end. These characteristics and parameters develop a clear understanding for the rider, and what to expect.

The characteristics of the frame had a great impact on the rider. When he started this ride, he was convinced that the "old folks" were right about the directions and routes he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Even though the sun was setting, he refused to give up, just as he said, “The sun was starting to strike, but I noticed it forcefully.” He would come to dilapidated and deserted places, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had forced him to drink his water quite regularly, so he tried to get more, as in the paragraph "I got on all fours when I tried a drop or two, it was good. taste of battery acid "@ NUM1. He was so thirsty that he drank hot water. Then he thought he only had NUM2 miles to go so he continued. He weakened as he pedaled over the changing terrain as he "tried to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." "With what little energy he had left, he had passed an abandoned Well be grape juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to ' collecting some pebbles and put them in my mouth "just to keep his mind off his thirst. He was losing hope when he came across" Gary and Wilber's best bet in the fishing camp "and then he felt relieved after he could get cool water.At that point, he learned his lesson, to stick to his card.

In remembrance of the author of his long and tiring bike ride, he spoke of the difficulties he had to face. when he left that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to @ CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He chose to take their advice but later regretted it. when he found the towns they were talking about, he only found ghost towns. “Never accept travel advice from a collection of elders who have not left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” He finally reached a town where he found signs of life. There he asks another old man if he knows the way to Yosemite, the guy says he has a good map. Throughout his journey he was doomed to the sun and lack of water. The sun made him hot and thirsty, forcing him to drink a lot of water. when he took his last sips, he refused to drink it and began to lose consciousness. "I could have heatstroke on a beautiful June day."

A cyclist cannot move as fast as as slowly as he pedals. If the frame is a sunny and humid day, it can't go too fast due to its lung capacity. If it is a hot but windy day, he should watch his speed to avoid injury. Basically, unless the weather is good enough or safe enough, it will go fast. But his safety care first, so it mainly depends on the weather but also the time of day. If it is dark [dark], reflectors should be in place to avoid having it.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affecting the rider due to the heat and the terrain. I say this because in the story he describes all the hills he has to go up and down with the hereditary heat that befalls him. The heat also makes it difficult because it makes you drink more and throughout history he has tried to find water, and the water he found was around "two hundred degrees and tasted like battery acid ". If you don't have water it is very difficult to cover such a long distance in such heat.   

<START>

 

The rider is affected by many characteristics of the frame. the long hill is one example, the serpent and the dirt road are two more. The heat of the desert is another, and its depleting water supply are all examples of features that have affected it.

The characteristics of the scenery affect the cyclist in this story. First of all, in the story it is written " ... and the growing awareness that I might fall from heatstroke ... " (@ NUM1).

DURING THIS TIME, HE RIDATES HIS BIKE FOR MILES AND MILES IN THE HEAT OF SUMMER. HIS THIRD THOUGHTS CAUSE HIM TRYING TO CONTINUE TO FIND YOSEMITE.

The cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all. he was in the desert on a very hot June day, and every town he had come to was abandoned and had no water. It was also very hilly, which made the job even more difficult.

The characteristics of the parameter “ Road difficult to ride, do not exceed posted speed limit ” affects the rider because they determine how easy or difficult it is for the rider to ride. For example. The earth being hot would allow it to die or heat without water, the earth being dry means that it has no place to fill its water supply and the earth being barren means for man that if it was not of heat stroke, there is a chance he will not be found and will not survive. Another example of how the frame features offer the rider goes down in history when the road gets rough and he sees the speed time sign. This shows that the characteristics of the frame, namely the contour of the terrain and the roughness of the road, make the journey much more difficult for the rider. The features of a frame could be the greatest arrest of a cyclist, and if they have a long, hard journey in which they have to surpass themselves like in this story or a nice car ride.

The " Do not exceed posted speed limit " rider was permanently affected by the setting. He was biking in California - which is a hot place to start - in June - which made it even hotter when he came across a hot desert. When you do a physical activity like this, the last thing you want is to be warm. The narrator brought only one bottle of water which he drank regularly at first. Then it started to get hot and he had no more water. It affected his body making him tired, and his mind because he started to doubt himself. Then there was the abandoned juice building where they made juice. He said: "In an ironic twist, the abandonment years earlier had been a Welch's grape juice factory and bottling plant." He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant. The rider was definitely affected by both his mental environment - saying "I'm going to die." - and physically by becoming dehydrated.

The cyclist was riding over rough, dry, abandoned terrain that made his trip almost fatal. He described it as "In the high deserts of California in June". It was dry, lifeless and hot. The sun was hitting him and he often needed to drink water, but it was lacking. The empty cities were what he wanted for fresh water, but they had been very abandoned. This made his trip very dangerous. He could have fallen at any time from heat stroke. He would have died on the spot. His sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. He had to heighten those extremes. Ironic conditions for miles, just to find water. It was everything a desert and everything a house shouldn't go through.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider . The hallmarks are old abandoned towns and warm temperatures. Also abandoned buildings. It makes the cyclist think that all hope is lost.

" Then to a merry mo In a twist ironic which should appeal to all sadists reading this, the building [...] from its appearance had been a grape juice factory and a welch bottling factory [...] I lowered the head this smoky blue tune in to the summer time rattle. Then, in a good mood, he says, " As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply in the sink, I had an irresistible urge. to look for Gary and Wilber, to kiss them.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider. On the one hand, he was cycling in the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to overheat and sweat. He therefore drank frequently from his water bottles. Unfortunately, since there was " no idea, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, " he had nowhere to fill his bottles and get dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain has changed from a flat road to “short rolling hills”. Normally this wouldn't cause too much difficulty, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, every hill seemed "crippling". the cyclist would have had a much more pleasant experience.

Excitement, hopelessness and self-pity are all feelings that the rider would experience because of the surroundings. He was really excited to go to Yosemite Park because of his calm. He said, "The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite call my name." He wanted to have them because it was very hot. He started to desperately need the water, so he drank from that hot water hole. "I tried a drop or two, it tasted like battery acid." He was running out of water so he desperately needed it. He started to feel sorry for himself, "sometimes life can be so cruel", he felt sorry for himself because he still had such a long way to go.

The rider has been affected by the weather, people and the environment. The climate was desert in June which was very hot with little water. It made him dehydrated and miserable.

Another feature that affected the frame is when the story says "I got on all fours, working the rusty water pump handle with all my might". This statement shows that the cyclist was dying of water and did not think he would get out. The last characteristic that affected the rider was when the story read " A bumpy road ahead : do not exceed the posted speed limit."

In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite Park through a desert that dehydrated him and changed his mood. While crossing this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the towns he was told about turned out to be deserted, and because he couldn't find water there, he quickly became dehydrated. This is the obvious effect the setting had on him, another effect was to make him doubt the elderly and change his mood from confident to desperate. As he cycled through the desert, desperately seeking a living in the hope of finding water, he realized that the elderly know the past better than the future because they do not travel to the ever-changing world as much as they used to when at first he trusted in the guidance and wisdom of the old.

Because the setting for cycling is a dry desert, the cyclist seems more and more determined. He's going against all odds, so it looks like he's pushing himself to the limit. Against the heat and the long road he travels and without water, all seems lost for the cyclist. But in the end, he pulls himself together and does it for himself and triumphs over adversity.   

<START>

 

Reading the story, I think the scenery of the desert he was traveling through affected him greatly. I think it affected him in the way his attitude towards the cyclist changed for the worse. At first he was very motivated, determined and hydrated. Over time and miles, the landscape engine has changed. It can be very difficult. in heated water or, you should be as hydrated as possible, especially sustained physical activity. When he continued he was starting to run out of water and had nothing on his mind for a long time, how much bigger, how thirsty he was and is it worth it ? It's much more eager to motivate when there is something to look out for to keep your mind of the rider's attitude changed for the worse. From my point of view, I strongly believe that it could have been a form of desert sand work for seeds for a long time. I have ??? ??? ??? in exercise while doing on ???. It's hard to see ??????????? thing. My attitude will go to the farm. I'm so determined that I miss " to " what's the point. " But I thought it was awesome as he never gave up ??? things turned out badly. It opened my eyes to see how great it is to react to your own goals.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider by dehydrating him. The cyclist said: “I worked hard. At one point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. The cyclist was in the desert and with every mile traveled he became more and more dehydrated. The desert sun was drying out her body. He would say to every landmark that passed, "I spent trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." @ CAPS1 that the more he walked, the more the desert affected and dehydrated him.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. One way is that the cyclist does not stick to his card. Instead of sticking to his card, he had asked two elderly people. The elderly who gave directions to the cyclist also gave him a shortcut to take. This is where the second effect happened where the rider started using a shortcut instead of the main road. This is how the characteristics of the frame affected the rider.       

<START>

 

Some of the frame characteristics that affected the rider were the road conditions and the course changes with the hills. So far the rider has had a good ride for around two miles after starting his trip after which that started to change. This is confirmed when the author states : " Not two miles in this next section of the trip, I noticed the terrain was changing " (kurmaskie). Even though the author started this journey well, it didn't take long for things to change against him. Although the hills and the road conditions change, the character in the story still solves his problems without much hassle. With all the problems in the frame, the cyclist always manages to complete his journey.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame pose two main problems for the cyclist: doubt and dehydration. From the test, you can deduce that the rider is in doubt that he will ever make it to Yosemite due to the constant characteristics of the test which make him lose hope and confidence. For example, towards the end of the test, the cyclist is already exhausted and desperate, but then sees a building on top of a hill. He rushes to the building to find that it is an abandoned and dilapidated factory @ ORGANIZATION1. After regaining his hopes, he is forced to get back on his bike and continue. This characteristic of the frame causes further disappointment in the rider and installs more doubt in his mind. Despite the loss of self-confidence and the hope of making it to Yosemite, the features of the scenery also cause him a serious and literal problem: dehydration. The weather is not right and it has to continue over hills and rough roads. He lacks water and in the only city where he finds that the water from the pump is not drinkable. The characteristics of the environment cause him these problems and are the reason why his health is in danger.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. @ NUM1 way is the state of the roads. Another is the heat. Another is the snakes. Another is not a glimpse of the city. The last is the lack of information. @ MONTH1 be the guy who did it. @ MONTH1 or he was injured during the trip. Maybe a snake bit him. Regardless, the frame affected the rider in several ways.             

<START>

 

In the essay, the frame description was dry, hot, very open and dessert. The description might suggest loneliness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone and didn't know where he was going, he still persisted. As he thought of the "cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite." The thought kept him strong, so he kept trying.    

<START>

 

Many features of the terrain affected the rider and his journey. First of all, it is a desert, which affects it a lot because there is no water in the deserts. There was also a snake, which could have bit and killed him. As the road was not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years, this made cycling much more difficult for him. And the juice factory just taunted him, reminding him of his need for water, just like the well that didn't pump cold water, but pumped hot, raw water.    

<START>

 

When the cyclist begins his journey, he is very sure of himself. He sees everything as the old men have told him. As he travels, he notices that everything is abandoned and empty. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." The man started to get very uncertain. You can tell he said, "I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get aroused." He very much doubted that he would get to where he was going. In the end, he was very relieved to have found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the decor greatly affected the cyclist in this story. Unreliable directions, barely enough water for the ride, poor road conditions, and other hazards like heat and animals made this ride very difficult for the rider. At the start of the trip, the rider received the wrong information on how to get to his destination, which led to a long, difficult trip with little water. He says in the story “The speed limit was @ NUM1. I was doing a @ NUM2 that depletes the water. " This means it ran out of water too quickly for the amount of dirt it covered. Another feature of the net that affected it was that the road conditions were getting worse. deteriorated more and more until he reached a freeway late in his trip. He said that “ the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills. ” This means that the terrain has been faster and easier to navigate. been replaced by slower, more difficult terrain to navigate much living this story.         

<START>

 

The characteristic of the setting affected the rider, as as his surroundings changed he lost all hope of making it to Yosemite National Park. Like when he was passing through his first town and it looked abandoned, he wasn't sure if he would continue. In addition, when he did not see anyone or any building, he worried and wanted to give up hope. But as the second road sign appeared, he was relieved.     

<START>

 

The framework of this news makes the cyclist doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack of water. The cyclist has no water and thinks it is only a matter of time before he dies. Another big problem is the rough terrain. The rough terrain is difficult for the cyclist to overcome. In addition, there are no buildings, people or cars in sight to save it. Until he found the bait shop, if anything had happened to him, there would have been no one to help him.

The characteristics of the setting "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" strongly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road goes from smooth and easy to hilly and full of hills. It is difficult for him to ride a bicycle. He needs more energy to get over the hills. Another example is where it says " Wild weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me ." The connection to the sight of a tumbleweed is that of being abandoned and alone, which heightened their sense of hopelessness. Finally, he sees Welch's Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and only serves to make him thirstier. All of these things affect the rider. The fact that he sees the grape juice plant is also ironic, as he is extremely dehydrated and the plant is abandoned.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. the first of these is the scorching heat. He's basically in a desert and he's running out of water. As it starts to run out of water it starts to conserve it, which dehydrates it so it gets weaker and weaker: "I would conserve my water and go inside for about an hour - a test." of my inner mind. Next is the rugged terrain. When riding on rough terrain on a bike it can be difficult to keep going and the rider was already running low on water “ a large road sign jumped out at me. I read: bumpy road ahad: Do not exceed the posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel “. Finally is the structure First there was the ghost town with the water that tasted like “battery acid”. There was also the grape juice factory and the Welch's bottling plant, both of which were probably going downhill. “A shortbread photo of a young boy pouring a glass of refreshing juice into his mouth was still visible. I put my head down. ” As you can see, the characteristics of the settings generally affected the rider.

The author finds the sorry and harsh settings not to be daunting, but rather stand out as a cause for fun and fun, quest-like testing. The author writes that after arriving in his first ghost town, he laughs, amused by the funny "old men" and their crazy ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment and realizes that he is no longer established at all, he is slightly disappointed, but sees it as "a test of [his] inner spirit". In the third building, an abandoned factory, he still appreciates the irony of the situation. While crossing the desert by bike, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and rather uses it as a point of reference to work on his progress and as a means of surpassing himself. Although the author is faced with empty and disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and continues to push

In the story Rough Road Ahead: Don't Go Over the Speed Limit, the reader sees the landscape and terrain become rougher and more lonely, and as the rider travels and the limits are pushed back, his outlook is somewhat bleak. , he only expects the worst. The rough road begins after a water pump he finds fails to give him piping, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor for her life, and is the source of her life. At first he drank it regularly and when he gets to the pump it's bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself. The cyclist in this story is very aware of the condition of his body and recognizes his dehydration. At one point he said "and the growing awareness that I could fall from heat stroke just because I had listened to gentlemen who hadn't been out of their porch for a decade," he said. later that made him laugh sadly, desperately the lack of humans and their technology really broke him.

The desert is nature's most cruel of environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and oppressive heat are enough to kill even the most rugged creature. While traveling in a desert one must maintain a constant supply of water and know your way against the power of nature in "Do not exceed posted speed limit", cyclist Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the heat of the desert and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in the @ NUM1 paragraph, "Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt, I could fall from heatstroke." If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to function properly. In the desert, one must refresh oneself or perish. In @ NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert: “I had knocked my water bottles fairly regularly and was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. “ As that water begins to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, hopelessness and loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, " the birds would pluck you (you) cleanse you, leaving only expensive outing gear ."

The characteristics of the “ Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit ” frame affect the rider cruelly. The old man says the cities are going to be there and they just don't work. To make the rider feel desperate, the setting puts them on an extremely hot California June day and puts on all of those unexpected twists and turns. One cruel thing to add in the test was when it read “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was running out of water at 20 km / h. This reduces the rider's confidence, making them more worried. Another cruel thing is that the author adds a welch grape juice factory that had been abandoned with “A shortbread photo of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of @ NUM1 juice into his mouth” causing him to utterly lose hope. These features in the frame are cruel.       

<START>

 

The elements of the scenery, such as the ghost town desert and the juice factory, give the cyclist a feeling of hopelessness. He ran out of water when he got to the ghost town, which he thought was @ CAPS1 because the next town was just a few steps down the road. However, when he arrived in the next "town" and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot and dirty liquid came up instead of water. He was starting to lose hope when he arrived at the abandoned Welch's factory. All hope of him at that point was lost, claiming that "the birds will pick me up cleanly", For the cyclist was also the best, and then he was "saved" by a bait shop. These features of the setting gradually drained his hope, until he came to the bait shop, after which his hope, but certainly not his faith in old men, returned to him.

As part of the test ; "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit." had a great effect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the pitch was so difficult to cross. For example : “ At one point weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake - it really looked like a diamond behind most of the sidewalk in front of me, I walked smoothly, trying to keep my balance in my. state of dehydration. "The author describes in detail how, whatever the obstacles he encounters, he keeps trying to let go. Terrain affects the character in the determined keeping. This happens to many people in their sports. For example, in soccer they take all the problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game.

This essay takes place in an arid desert landscape. As the frame is very hot, it dehydrates more quickly. Fones are also rare. In this place, as he sometimes put it in a free essay, “the negg down was only @ NUM1 on the road. This place also made him question what he had seen thinking it might just have been a mirage.

The many features of the frame affected the rider in different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him making him laugh. In the essay, it is said: "A wonderful day in June made him laugh". It shows, despite what happened, that he might have been having a nice day outside, giving him an upbeat attitude. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It made him sweat and almost die of dehydration. "Growing awareness that I could fall from heat stroke" This shows that he was very aware that he could die from the power of the sun. So the parameters around the rider affected him in different ways.

In the surroundings, the conditions were brutal. The author experienced heat, fatigue and bad directions. He suffered from depression and almost died. He had an encounter with a great old snake and he finally reached his destination. It affected him and he learned to bring a map and not to be guided by the elderly.

The setting affected the rider as it made it more difficult to ride. For example, the weather was extremely hot. “The sun was starting to beat. " He says this has not affected, but he was very thirsty and was dehydrated internally if it affected him. In addition, weeds and snakes scared him. “ Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. " This could not make his journey easier. Then the hills and the roads, "on a long crippling hill". It just goes to show how intense his ride was. This is how the setting affected the rider in " Do not exceed posted speed limit " by Joe Kurmaskie.

The characteristics of the surrounding environment affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect it are heat, lack of water, lack of buildings nearby and @ CAPS2. One of the biggest issues for this rider is the heat. He said, “ I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ”. this shows that it is quite warm outside in the month indicated. June is a pretty hot month, especially in the deserts of @ CAPS1. The second problem is the lack of water for cyclists. He tells throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink water. When he reaches the end, however, he finds water. The third problem is that when he needs water, he can't find it anywhere because of the lack of buildings. He pedals long distances trying to find nearby "towns". Once he finds them, they are either "ghost towns" or are not useful at all. The last problem it faces is the @ CAPS2. He says, "At one point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake… blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me." @ CAPS2 gets in his way and does not help him reach his destination at all. Truly . the characteristics of the neighboring setting affect it dramatically, as so many things like heat, lack of water, buildings and @ CAPS2 are just inches away.

The settings affect the rider because in California it can get very hot at times. The cyclist could become dehydrated on a long trip and pass out seriously injuring himself. There are also a lot of hills which could be very difficult for the cyclist.  

<START>

 

In the essay, the author added many features that could be selected on the cycle route. One characteristic was that his water supply was short. This shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking. Another feature would be the old rusty pipe with bad water: this shows that this city had been abandoned for years and the water supply was not drinkable. The essay overall shows how hot it gets in hot weather with a lack of supplies and no sense of direction.

The cyclist in “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ”. had to go through a rough time in the California desert. It was hard for him because it was very hot in the desert in June. That he was almost out of water; at first it was easy to drive on level ground. But when it came to rolling he had to use more power and ???.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider as he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no city nearby made it worse. There were also the bumpy roads and hills which tired out and made the rider even more thirsty. Finally, there was the factory which made him think of juice and made him even more thirsty.

The characteristics of the tuning affect the rider because the real rider knows how fast a bike is, so you don't need to tell them. If a cyclist needed a few directions, he would go to a gas station and not to an elderly person's house. A real cyclist can go as long as he wants before stopping because he is tired. A true cyclist knows how to do laps on a bike, he doesn't have to do them over and over again to be able to do them. A true cyclist doesn't have to train to take a lap and win, he has to train to be able to win.

The setting of the story had a great effect on the cyclist. The desert and hot environment made the cyclist tired or uncovered. For example, the cyclist observes, "A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and a comer that couldn't fit in the most dismal mule greeted me. That sight was a problem." This quote shows that the old battered environment worried him. The author also says that "there was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." In this quote, the cyclist realizes his isolation and begins to become more determined to reach his destination. Realize that you have never been lost, then you know it can be overwhelming if there is no sign of life around you. All you want to do is go on and hope you can find your way. This feeling is manifested through the rider and now the surroundings that surround him influence his course.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. One of them is that it was daytime and the sun is bothering the cyclist. Another is that because there was nothing around him, he felt frustrated. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." If something was there he wouldn't feel frustrated and at least he would have more hope of finding something.

In Joe Kurmaskie's "Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" story, the rider was adversely and fatally affected by the frame. The cyclist travels " the high deserts of California in June ". It was hot, so hot in fact, that the author realized that he could “fall from heatstroke” at any time. This unbearable heat, coupled with the " crippling " hilly terrain was enough to reduce the rider to severe dehydration. Obviously no positive effect. The sweltering heat and merciless hills of the setting wouldn't be so terrible if there had been places to stop, rest, and replenish your eyes by diverting the water supply. However, “There was no one in sight, not a building or structure of any kind.” The cyclist was in incomplete isolation over more than @ NUM1 miles of arid desert, the sweaty sun warming over him as he was clearly climbing steep, inflexible hills. the frame affected the rider in a horribly negative way.          

<START>

 

Riding a bike for a very long time without water is bad, but it's even worse when your surroundings are worse. For example, when the cyclist has no water, it is a day with nothing around him to help him. In addition, without water, he could pass out and become dehydrated. When he can't find anyone to help him and nothing around him, he sucks a rock to keep his mouth hydrated. Therefore, you should always check your destination on a bicycle before you get there.    

<START>

 

It is very difficult to be outside in hot weather, let alone advice from the elderly and cycling. If you feel like it's @ NUM1 on the outside, you don't need to be there. No matter how long you are outside, heat stroke can strike any body faster than it can count to @ NUM2.  

<START>

 

On the way to @ CAPS1, the cyclist was riding in hot, dry weather over rough terrain. It made him tired and dehydrated. Halfway through his journey, he couldn't see anything for miles. It must have been disheartening. The whole trip he was dehydrated and when he found water it was @ NUM1 degrees @ CAPS2 from the heat.    

<START>

 

Hot and bumpy roads, no shade, all are things that affect the rider on his journey. He was rolling in ??? then the sun started hitting him and he said it looked like the desert, ”considering it was so hot. The road was good at the start and then it took a while and it really started to get tough and hard to go. The part where he has no shade has to be zero because he has the sun beating down on him all the time. These are all reasons the rider shouldn't have taken directions in the first place.

The setting of “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the speed limit ” affects the rider in many cases. The words " high deserts of California in June " taken from the story show that it is very hot and dry. The cyclist is very tired and in the desert there are no big ponds to draw water, so if you don't have water you have nothing. The cyclist also suffers from the difficulty of having to ride on, on and over rough terrain. In the story it is said that there was a sign saying " Rough Road Ahead ". There were also stubborn objects such as tumbleweeds and snakes that he had to bypass. The dry, rugged and dangerous setting put the rider's life in danger, but thanks to his dedication he managed to pull through.              

<START>

 

The characteristics of the parameter " Do not display the speed limit @ CAPS1 " affected the rider. The text reads: " The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills " (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The flat road on which it was easy to cycle had turned into many hills which made the cyclist's job much more difficult. The rider was negatively affected by this setting as it contributed to his difficult times and made him lose hope.       

<START>

 

In the story "Rough Road Ahead", the rider is affected by the characteristics of the frame in several ways. In a sense, the rider is affected by the characteristics of the frame in several ways. The cyclist is particularly affected when he has to cross hills and plains. The hills make it very difficult to pedal uphill. The rider is also challenged when he is almost out of the water. They need water to survive especially during their long bike ride. Finally, the heat that the cyclist must endure also affects them. The heat makes it difficult to stay focused on the long trip.       

<START>

 

The characteristics greatly affect the setting of the story. At the start of his journey, there are people and he has no problem. After talking to the old men and starting his journey to town from @ NUM1, there is no one around. There are no buildings on the site and no water source. Since there was no one around his confidence to complete the trip, it was not long before he got off. When he got to the first town, he noticed that it was an old town and that there was no one left. It drove him crazy and his confidence dropped a lot. When he got to the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought that he would never get there and he would die. Once he got to the last spot it was a busier executive. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get some water. The setting with no one around makes him lose a lot of confidence.

The characteristics of an environment, such as terrain and weather, greatly affect the cyclist who rides a bicycle in it. The characteristics of a frame can make it easier or more difficult for cyclists to travel. Weather can cause them to use their water faster or slower, rain as poor road conditions could force a cyclist to slow down. In the test "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the cyclist is slowed down and more tired due to the characteristics of the environment in which he was. The lack of water and the towns slowed it down. Rough roads did as well. The hills and animals on the road slowed the rider even further. The characteristics of a setting can help or hinder a rider, and in the case of "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit", the characteristics seriously interfered with their riding on a bicycle.       

<START>

 

The characteristic of the frame affects the rider in several ways. If it was a straight road it would be smooth navigation. If the road was bumpy he would jump up and down a bit. If he rode in the woods it would be cool and a little dark. If he was driving in the desert, it would be very hot and bright.    

<START>

 

The characteristics of the parameter " Rough Road Ahead : do not exceed the posted speed limit " greatly affect the rider. I'm sure the heat makes the rider thirstier, and the heat can also drain energy extremely quickly. Being in “the California desert in mid-June” doesn't seem like a good time for biking. When the rider got tired and exhausted from not having water, I'm sure walking past all the empty terrain had an effect on his attitude. I think seeing a building got him excited, then when he found out it was nothing more than an abandoned building his spirits dropped sharply. He probably felt like he couldn't go on for very long just because all the buildings he encountered were empty or abandoned. When the rider reached the bait shop, he probably felt a lot better and very relieved that he had arrived before he got heatstroke.          

<START>

 

When the cyclist passed through the old towns as the old man told him, the frame played a big role in making his situation more difficult to overcome when he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty . The text says " we pumped the handle for several minutes but the water was not cooling, it tasted like battery acid ". The second drinking source he encountered was @ PERSON1's abandoned juice factory. These two objects made his situation mentally more difficult to overcome because he was so close to what he needed on numerous occasions and then it was taken away from him.     

<START>

 

The cyclist is affected by the change of terrain from flat to hilly, the directions of older men and especially his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for the time he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get some water, which he ends up doing. He is also a little angry and disappointed with the instructions of the old men. He's really doing a lot more miles than he should be shown and he's starting to wonder if they haven't lost him.    

<START>

 

There are many different characteristics such as the weather, road condition, and how the person feels. The weather can have an effect if it is raining or if the road is messy it could have a flat tire. How the person feels is a big part of the time they try or they don't care too much.  

<START>

 

Depending on the test, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider. If the rider is in the middle of a hot desert in June without water, the rider will be excessively thirsty the longer he goes. For example; the author states “ I regularly knocked my bottles and traveled to the high desert of California in June ”. The terrain turns into short, rolling hills from flat terrain, forcing the cyclist to push forward to fetch water in the next town. For example; she declares "on a long crippling hill, a building has appeared". This caused the rider to use what he considered his last burst of energy to descend there, but the building was abandoned, making the rider feel like he was disappointed. As the cyclist continued on a setting a bait store came up and the cyclist felt relieved that now she could get water. These examples show the change of frame on the rider's path and how it affected it.

In the test "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit", a cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. He followed the "shortcut" that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer path. These old men had no idea what they were really talking about, so the cyclist ended up making his way through more obstacles. When the cyclist needed more water, he encountered "several rusty pumps". No water would come out of these pumps, so he had no choice but to continue @ CAPS1 water. As he went on in his travels he said that "flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills". @ CAPS1 water, he didn't have much strength left to face the hills, but he had no choice. The rider must have traveled for miles @ CAPS1 seeing anyone or anything. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." His troubles were finally over after he got instructions from another man at a fishing camp.

The setting adds a feeling of ergancy. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the middle of dessert. If he had been in the forest or in the suburbs, it wouldn't be so bad. He talks about fainting and dying. He exclaims that it doesn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds were going to pick me up clean.

In the story, do not exceed the speed limit posted by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the road in front of him. He took advice he thought was right, but it was wrong. So it took him away from his property he was trying to reach  

<START>

 

The way the settings affect the rider is very cruel. First, the rider took the directions of someone who hasn't left their porch in decades. So once he accepted the instructions and used them, problems arose. One of the main problems is that the cyclist is running out of water. The cyclist also encountered snakes. Another direction was very far away, so he had more time to go than he thought. Also when he arrived from his trip he found a deserted city. So, in conclusion, the cyclet now uses its own instructions.       

<START>

 

As the setting changes in the story, so does the mood of the cyclist's narrator. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first, the cyclist is so happy with Yosemite that he is carefree and does not care at all. He says, "I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face." Even at his first 'ghost town' he was content to 'laugh, check my water supply and get on with it'. After that point, he couldn't be so carefree. After this town he came to " A dilapidated shed, several thirsty pumps and men ." He said, “It was disturbing,” it was very hot and he had drunk his water quite often. He said, “He failed.” He started to get a little afraid, he realized that he could “fall from heatstroke.” He was afraid that because of his idea of believe the old men, he could possibly die. rejoice when he reached the bait shop and got his drink. From stock to card. His attitude has changed a lot throughout history.          

<START>

 

In "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the cyclist is very affected by his surroundings. He leaves the old water pump for Yosemite. “Not two miles of flat road has been replaced by short hills. The speed limit was 55. I was doing a @ NUM1 which depletes the water.” This shows that as the terrain gets rougher and rougher , it is all the more difficult for the cyclist to move forward. In addition, since it already gets to the point where it becomes dehydrated, it is all the more difficult for the already tired rider. going farther and less going to Yosemite, that's how the terrain affects the rider.

The setting affected the rider making him very hot. He said he started sucking stones because he heard that if you suck stones it doesn't make you thirsty. He also said he could hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks. He said he wanted to swallow the stones. The reason was that he was so sexy. He didn't even know where he was going.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame did not help the rider on his journey. First of all he was in the desert by bike! Which helped him get dehydrated faster. Second, the "cities" around the path had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask his way . Finally, there was no one around so if the rider should be in trouble, he could not find help.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the parameters affect the rider for many reasons such as; dehydration, the road made me stop functioning. Since it seems that there is a lack of water in the dessert, the guy could easily get dehydrated. Intense heat can cause this. The road on which it is driving causes the tires to burst.

The cyclist was eager to get to Yosemite Park, he listened to the "old timers who have not left the confines of their porches since Carter was in power." He followed the path that the old men told him to take. He walked down a hill to the town which was empty in a hard road and snakes in its way, then up a hill, then came down the hill and saw an abandoned “Welch Grape Juice Factory”. Then he saw a sign that read “ Gary And Wilber FISH CAMP-IF YOU WANT BIT FOR THE BIG, WE ARE YOUR BEST BET !” So he runs into the bathroom and drinks at the sink. Before you get there. , he was thirsty and tired and when he saw the abandoned building he saw a young boy drinking a juice, he wiped his eyes to see if he hadn't seen a mirage. So he put some pebbles in his mouth. It says that sucking stones helps to forget thirst by allowing the saliva you have left to circulate. Then he left and then a stone entered his throat. His troubles, his thirst and his fear were all behind him when he saw this sign.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. One of the characteristics of the setting was the warmth. It affected him by dehydrating him. For example, the text reads : " The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips that I could drop from a heatstroke ." It meant the heat was getting to him.       

<START>

 

The author made the decor seem long and unbearable, felt unwanted heat and lack of water at hand. Especially in the way he continued to describe the road with all of these challenges that kept appearing like after @ NUM1 miles in a town and then @ NUM2 miles passed that he "came to a park of ???. A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a carrol that could not fit in the hamest mule greeted me. This sight was disturbing. Then he said, “I was traveling hard in the high deserts of California in June. @ CAPS1 ?? imagine, the heat and the unbareabalnes of the trip ??? that I am still facing. @ CAPS1 this bike seen endlessly. Then with a winning push on him eg, “I was doing a 12 mph water exhaustion, sacred life can be seen cruel. "@ CAPS1 he feels his compulsion on the trip @ CAPS1 me feels his grief compulsion for his endless journey that he had to go through. Another example is :" I have ripened the sweat from my eyes to make sure that I was not a mirage ". Then, reaching that, the building gave up years ago. @ CAPS1 her journey was seen without hope and long which was endless with first wave problems to give her life force @ CAPS1 his journey was seen as more difficult and filled with hope as the strength remaining to complete his goals.

In the story "Do not exceed the postal speed limit", many characteristics of the frame affect the rider. First and foremost, it is affected by the people who live there. "Never accept travel advice from a group of elders who have not left the confines of their front porch since Carter was in power." This quote describes the feelings that the cyclist has towards old people. Because he listened to their instructions, he passed through ghost towns and died of dehydration every hour. In addition, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around whom he could ask for help. “… But that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author tries to stop to get water, but as no one lives in the city, he no longer receives it. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. " That smoky blues tune ' Summer time ' echoed through the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain." It describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying out. However, his need is of water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another city, or that goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park.

The characteristics of the frame affect humans in several ways. One way is that when man notices that the terrain begins to change, he becomes more and more clueless. He sees the sign saying " Rough road ahead: Don't exceed the speed limit stuck ", it's almost as if he thinks the sign is laughing at him. Also, when the biker says "In a @ CAPS1 twist that should appeal to all sadists ..." he tells the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was not expecting anything.       

<START>

 

In the story I read, the frame is an important factor for the affect of the cyclist, for example, it talks about the way the cyclist sees the sign that says: “Bumpy road ahead! Do not exceed the posted speed limit. So the cyclist must be careful  

<START>

 

The rider was a horribly unpleasant environment for cycling, but what really disrupted the cycle was running out of water. There was no house to fill his bottle or no one around to give him up to date instructions. The heat made him drink more water and also more difficult to breathe in extreme heat. Without these faults, the cyclist would have been fine.   

<START>

 

I think the characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. For example, he talks about things he had to endure while riding. For example, he had no water so he was parched. There was a huge snake occupying half of the road and there was no building in sight. So the executive affected him with doubt but he was confident to get where he needed to go and then when he got there it was a sign of relief. This is how the affected parameter was.     

<START>

 

The setting of the story affected the rider both physically and mentally. They physically affected him because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains. Also, because he didn't follow his plan on the map, he had no idea where he was and so I think the anxiety of it all had an impact on his good. -be physical. It affected him mentally because every town he passed through, or every building he passed through was deserted and he had no idea where people were, so it must have been stressing him out. It upset him mentally and he thought he was going to die, it's not good for anyone. I really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to old fools anymore. Maps don't go crazy and don't really get stale, and maps don't lie to you, so he's obviously learned his lesson.

Certain characteristics like the change of landscape affected the rider. Differing from flat terrains to miniature hills to highways is quite difficult to deal with, especially since it was dehydrated and had no water.

The characteristics of the frame in the test " Rough Road Ahead ". Assigned the speaker by presenting challenges such as dehydration, dangerous animals and rough terrain to teach him a lesson on how to follow the travel advice of old people. In the essay, he confidently begins his journey after following "their advice", believing that the men seemed "to have no sense of themselves when pointing out landmarks and heading out of town." mention of tumbling weeds', and even became dangerous with the appearance of a diamond-backed snake that blocked its way at the end, the setting becomes comfortable again, allowing it to learn its lesson through the hardships characteristics of the frame, and follow its own map from there.

The characteristics of the environmental setting affect the cyclist. A parameter is a specific time and place where an event takes place as well as the parameter of their characteristics, which is the background description essentially giving additional information about the topic or idea. The features as well as the frame interfere with the rider by the hot weather in Lodi, CA making the rider or motorcyclist warmer than usual as he heads in the wrong direction closer and closer to the scorching hot desert. In addition to this, he lacks water and begins to be more and more heat exhausted and he begins to lose consciousness and become dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character as he loses his sense of direction and because of this he panics more as his water supply is extremely low. An example of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is “ I calmed down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle only contained a few mouthwatering sips. Large rings of dried candy circled my skirt and the growing awareness that I could fall in love with a gorgeous one in June "(Joe Kurmaskie, @ NUM1)." The @ CAPS1 example is “This sight was disturbing. I had knocked my water bottles fairly regularly and was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Joe Kurmaskie, @ NUM2). ” The heat and the heat had also increased the character's self-confidence as he grew more and more panicked. An example of this is "I started to divide the ride into distances. I could see on the horizon, thinking to myself that if I could go this far, it would be fine. ”(Joe Kurmaskie, @ NUM1) In conclusion, the warm setting in California had affected the rider in several ways, it had depleted his water supply, which had depleted him , dehydrated and caused him to lose his logical sense in making decisions, regardless of his loss of sense of direction. also gave him more self-confidence as he moved on the roads and served the nearby town about twenty miles away in order to get some water so he @ M OIS1 survives.

The frame characteristics affect the rider in Joe Kurmaskie's Rough Road Ahead essay in several ways. In a way, the setting affected the rider when it was hot and the rider ran out of water. Another way the rider was affected by the setting was when he said he "could die of heatstroke on a beautiful June day just because he had listened to some gentlemen who hadn't gone out. from their porch for decades made me laugh ". the rider was affected that is when he entered the bait store and cooled off. Finally, when he rehydrated in the so the setting was a main factory for the rider in Joe Kurmaskie's "Rough Road Ahead" essay on his way to Yosemite National Park.

The cyclist chose to ride on the worst terrain that can be crossed. The cyclist passed through deserts and deserted towns. It was then that he started to feel thirsty. At first he was neither tired nor thirsty because he passed by cool trees and the water rushed in the morning. When he arrived in the desert part with no water source, he got thirsty and started drinking his water which quickly ran out. Not having a dry place can make you thirsty in itself, but after riding for a while it got bad. The scenery had everything to do with the fact that the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die of heat stroke. This is how the setting affected the rider.       

<START>

 

The setting affected the mood of the rider in the story. The cyclist was riding over rough terrain and hills. It made the rider feel like his trip was hopeless. When the rider arrived at the Abandoned Factory @ CAPS1 Grape Factory, he felt uncomfortable. He was extremely thirsty and there was a build @ ORGANIZATION1 there when the rider was crazy on the road he thought he could get some water. When that failed, the rider was even less determined. He felt the world was against him.      

<START>

 

The settings affected the rider, because wherever he goes it never seems to end. Like when he rode where the old men told him to go. He walked through a ghost town like they said he would walk through a town. Then he continued but it never ended and the summer heat started to hit him. Like when he started to dehidade, he got that old juice factor and started imagining he was drinking juice. So he started to see things.

As the author goes through this shortcut, it finds itself in a very dangerous setting. As the poem says, he's in the high deserts of California in June. A desert makes the heat unbearable for the cyclist. It's just the sun, the sand, and him. Then he indicates that the summer month of course makes temperatures for the rider around @ NUM1 almost maybe even warmer. This could cause her to drink a lot of water and lose almost all of her water supply. "The water bottle only contained a few mouthwatering sips." Then there is the distance of its journey. The author always says " About @ NUM2 miles " or " Twenty miles on the road. " All that hard work can cause heat stroke and killing him.

The features of the setting such as serving the sun and the abundant cities greatly affect the cyclist. The dry dessert makes her feel like she's riding forever. And probably makes him wonder if he will ever arrive in a city. The sun makes him even hotter when he doesn't already, makes him sweat more and makes him thirstier even more. The mood of this story ranges from happy to sad to happy. He is happy after driving to the first town, but the rest of the time towns are also abandoned and start to run out of water and he thinks he is going to die which makes him sad. Then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop and finds water.

In Joe Kurmaskie's " Rough Road Ahead ", the characteristics of the frame negatively affect the rider. The story takes place in June in California. It is a very hot time of year in such a desert place. The heat adds to the rate at which the cyclist becomes dehydrated, as well as his inability to think as coherently as he could have if he hadn't been in a desert in June. The cyclist also travels through a desolate, inhabited land. The author says, "There was no one in sight, not a construction car or structure of any kind." This highlights the characters' total lack of resources. There is nowhere in sight he can turn for help, water, food, or shelter. The road was also rough, dotted with many rolling and crippling hills. Such terrain is much more difficult to maneuver, especially in such a state of desperation. The setting of the story, " Rough Road Ahead " has a great impact on the cyclist.

There are a lot of things that affect the rider like heat, lack of water, bumpy roads and the long journey. The cyclist is outside in a desert so it is very hot. The account reads " and the growing awareness that I could die of heat stroke " (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). This means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated. The roads were very rough, eg, “ ROUGH ROAD AHEAD : DO NOT EXCEED DISPLAYED SPEED LIMIT ” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The roads got bumpy and there were a lot of hills for the cyclist to climb. There was no water either. So he / she lacked energy and that made the task even more difficult. Eventually the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in a very detrimental way. The hot temperature and the scorching sun made the author scorching hot and drained his energy faster. The emptiness of the scenery can make a person lose hope of finding a civilization. The narrator said: "It was a sad, desperate laugh, mind ..." (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). It is not the last of the harmful frame, the dry desert air has the greatest impact on his life. Dry air makes him thirstier for water than he doesn't have, causing him to dehydrate faster. The narrator said, “ I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The lonely and appalling characteristics of the environment the cyclist was in made it so much worse that he had no water.

In " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", a cyclist follows bad advice, which leads him to cross the desert with little water. The frame has a great effect on the rider as it causes dehydration, which presents the main conflict of the story. "The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips," the author says when her fresh water supply begins to run out. Another factor that the setting presents to the cyclist is the extreme heat of the California desert. This adds to the thirst and dehydration of the cyclist. The reader can tell that it is uncomfortably hot while reading, "Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt…, that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day…" The rough roads and rough terrain also present a challenge for the cyclist who slows down his advance towards Yosemite.

The rider is affected by the characteristics of the frame. The cyclists cycled his bike in the direction the old men told him to go to get to Yosemite. Soon he is running out of water and very tired and he believes he will die soon. But then he finds a fish camp, goes to the bathroom to revive himself. when he comes out, a man is seated on the steps. The author receives instructions from him and is happy that he is back on the right track.

There are a lot of frame effects in this facility which can be good and / or bad. The setting is alone on a deserted mountain road, without a house, without cars, without people. En now will give you some good and bad effects. A good effect is that you are alone, so while you are exercising you can relax and enjoy the energy. A bad thing is if you tire a tire or need help. You are storing because there is no one around. Another good thing is that you are alone, @ CAPS1 all cars. You don't have to worry about getting hit so you can just relax and enjoy the ride. Another bad thing is that there is no water so you might want to bring a lot of it with you. So whatever you decide to do, be careful and think you're thinking about the idea

The setting or environment in which the cyclist found himself made him feel isolated from the rest of the world. He knew there was no turning back once he started his adventure. No one was there to help him. The environment made him aware of the many risks involved in this adventure. Knowing that there was no help was his motivation to continue his long journey.

The characteristics of the frame make the rider desperate after realizing that he is not on a shortcut. The cyclist has a "growing realization that he could fall from a heat stroke" while riding. Also, the only building he saw for miles "had been @ NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory". The cyclist is plunged into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides, the song "'@ ORGANIZATION2' shakes the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain." At this point, the cyclist believes his own death is inevitable. He says his own death is inevitable. He said "hopefully I would have hit a lump and lodged one in my throat" when talking about the pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop and all hope returns as he "has drunk deeply from the sink." The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people, was the cause of this man's worry and, later, panic about his own life. This cyclist's desperation is a lot like the desperation of those in @ ORGANIZATION1, who, trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While @ PERSON1 @ ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for his survival, his surroundings made him feel the same desperation as the cyclist.

In the test " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the characteristics of the frame affect the cyclist because he has to cross different types of markers. First, he got information from the elderly. For example, when he showed the map to the elderly, they would only know the old shortcuts, not the new ones. Second, when he ran out of water. For example, when the cyclist ran out of water, he had to climb hills and that would tire him. Also when he tried to get water from that one thing only hot water came out last, when he finally got to a story the old man had a card. For example, when he asked the old man where he was going, he said I had my own card. So then, he knew he was in trouble. In conclusion, this is how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. The surroundings were very hot and there were a lot of hills. The cyclist had been up and down hills all day and it took a lot of energy when he saw the building that he thought could help him.

In Joe Kurmaskie's short story Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit, the characteristics of the setting affect the rider. When at the old house of the codgens, he has confidence in himself, as they told how a shortcut to Yosemite, giving that confidence he needs, as he leaves, he is still confident, these as the parameters change, the mood of the cyclist. after "about @ NUM1 miles in the pedal" the cyclist arrives at the first town, he is desperate because it is a ghost town ", still confident, runs out of water, he continues. after a few more miles, he comes to a small fork with a pump. Thinking it's cool, he goes to pump some water, he finds out that it is @ NUM2 ° @ CAPS1 and that it tastes like "battery acid" . Now he is desperate, no water, dehydrated and no towns around, he started to pedal and pedal, hoping to find a town around. When he finds a town, with water, the frame to be relieved and better for him because he finds water. In the end, the adjustment effect how the cyclist comes back against confident, then desperate when using water, than relieved when finding water. the water.

It would be a difficult risk at the start, but the cyclist takes it in the desert. As we all know, the desert can get hot, so a bike ride can quickly become enjoyable. Plus, when the only thing you see for miles is riding, sand, and an empty factory, your morale can easily drop quickly. It's just a holistic way of letting go.

The effect of the cyclist is very important because a lot of things can get worrying like if you can feel so hot and the water is not cooling it doesn't matter. But when you fall in your mouth it tastes like battery acid. He or anyone could just have heatstroke on a beautiful June day. So hot that you see something like a hot city pouring a refreshing glass of juice into its mouth might still leave.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived in a deserted town. Her confidence was still pretty high, but not like it was before arriving in Ghost Town. Twenty miles up the road after that he came to a fork in the road that contained a dilapidated shed, rusty and dirty pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and its lack of water was drying it out. The @ NUM1 paragraph states: "This sight was disturbing ... I regularly banged my water bottles and traveled through the high deserts of California." With little water and little energy, he gets tired and dehydrated quickly. The earth began to turn into hills and made it even more exhausted. Her mood had changed from confident to desperate. He even planned to change a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The characteristics obviously greatly affected the mood of the rider. Sometimes the disappointment can come from the so called "easy way out".

In the story, the setting affected the rider throughout the story until he arrived at the Body and Wilbers Fishing Camp. As the man rode his bike for a while he is, but as he drove into the first town it seemed like a ghost town. As he pedaled on "The sun was starting to beat but I barely noticed it". At this point, the weather affects him a lot, but he keeps cool Yosemite pines and rushing rivers in his head. He also had only a few mouthwatering sips from his water bottle as he walked up a large hill.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider, the frame was hot and rough terrain and he was tired and thirsty. The cyclist said: "Above a long crippling hill, a building appeared." This means that he needed water so badly, and the hill was so big that he needed water. He also said, "Summer 'stirred in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain." It's summer when he rides and to not think about his thirst, he hums the song "Summertime". He wants to show that heat cannot invade his body. He also says, “At one point some weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake. " He says the land is deadly because the snake has missed him. He needed to show with all objections, he could overcome anything. As you can see, the tuning greatly affected the rider.

A lot of things can affect a cyclist. But in history, three main characteristics of the frame have affected the rider the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. This gives us this quote, "That I could fall from heat stroke on a beautiful day in June." Because it was hot. This could make the cyclist thirsty. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. It would create exhaustion. We know there were many hills because in the text it says. The flat road was replaced by short hills. Going through all these hills can really tire someone out. A third characteristic of the frame would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story, the cyclist meets a large snake. This makes him dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a whole different story if the rider had been in the summer on @ DATE1, and not in June.                 

<START>

 

In the test " Do not exceed the displayed speed @ CAPS1 ", the parameter is used to modify the mood of the cyclist and to reflect his situation. For example, the statement “ the cool pines and the tumultuous Yosemite river had my name written all over it ” helps to describe the cyclist's situation. The idea of lush and fresh aquatic vegetation gives hope to @ CAPS4 on its increasingly hellish journey. The beauty of this setting is also reflected in the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the right setting equals a good result. Later, the cyclist encounters "a dilapidated shed, several rust pumps and a corral that could not fit in the worst mark". It's a depressing setting symbolizing a total loss of hope. And interacting at this point, the cyclist gets into trouble with his situation. While pedaling through the desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when the tumbling seeds, which is always the symbol of a deserted area, pass into cones. The nil of adjustment to affect and reflect mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story “ The @ CAPS2 of @ CAPS3 @ PERSON1 ”. @ CAPS4 @ PERSON1 was a wild beast filled with wasteland to symbolize and cause @ PERSON2 to change his personality surrounded by uncivilized people and make @ PERSON2 tears from his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultivated. Part of colonialism both provokes and reflects on this change. The “ Do not exceed posted speed limit ” test setting is used as an important element in character development.                        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the test explain how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider for a number of reasons. When the author writes that the tumbleweeds have crossed my path, "it shows that he is most likely in the middle of nowhere. This is true because tumbleweeds are usually a sign in movies and TV shows that the place is deserted. Moreover, when the author writes “ the growing awareness that I might fall from heat stroke ” and when he writes “ a ridiculously large snake ” shows the growing danger he is entering. This is true because the snakes might spend awhile or it might just collapse due to lack of water and die. Finally, the name of the store is revealing as it is a fish bait shop and it is thirsty. This is telling because the fish live in water and they are thirsty and seeing the sign relieves them completely. Therefore, the characteristics of this essay explain how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider.

The cyclist faces many challenges on his journey to Yosemite, one of which traverses the California deserts. It was quite a challenge because a desert is very hot and dry, and in addition the author was riding his bike, making himself thirstier and hotter. He also encountered a large snake that appeared to be a diamond back which he avoided even though it almost covered the road. The author also had to deal with rough terrain when he cycled through the hills. The rider took up the challenges and met them with bravery.      

<START>

 

In the test "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the speed limit", these many different parameters had negative consequences on the rider. For example, at first it started off with a nice, smooth ride. But it was very hot. Then he started to engage in many hills which were wreaking havoc on his legs. Then we entered a difficult area where he had to be more careful. The roughness has probably worn him out of all the bumps and bounces. He's been through a lot on this bike trip, who know he @ MOIS1 never returned to where he was staying.      

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider by making it more difficult for him to pedal and finish his race. For example, " the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills ". This should make his trip more difficult because instead of being able to pedal at a constant pace all the time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier again and again, using more energy. Another example is " through the high deserts of California in June ". This makes it more difficult for him as he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had no place to fill his water bottles, have a drink or cool off. This would make things difficult as he becomes dehydrated the entire trip. These are some of the characteristics of the frame that affect the rider by making their ride more difficult.           

<START>

 

One feature that affected the rider was the hills. The "text says" two miles in the section ... I noticed the terrain was changing ...

In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit", the setting greatly affects the story for a number of reasons. First, it's summer, so it's very hot. In addition, it is in the desert to the west, so there is already a very hot climate. Third, there is no civilization on the " shortcut " that it follows, so there is no way for the author to get water to replenish his body. This is how the characteristics of the decor affect the cyclist in the story.      

<START>

 

The setting affects the rider a lot, because if it was too windy, the rider would have to control the bike. The same goes for a lot of things, as the buildings and people outside their buildings would be very busy so they wouldn't be allowed to let the rider get there and therefore the rider would have to turn around. . Then if it was a clear road and no one was there and there were no buildings or houses then it would be an easy ride for the cyclist. So, as you can see, the tuning affects the rider in several ways.              

<START>

 

The rider was mainly affected by a few dreadful elements of the scenery. At first, when it was not so hot and there was a lot of water, the rider was doing perfectly fine. As the day progressed, he felt the heat beat down on him. He drank all his water, and now he felt hopeless. His mood changed with the scenery, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ ORGANIZATION1. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him wrong directions when he was in trouble, but thanked them once he realized they were right.

If it's a good day, the rider will want to ride. If it's a bad day, they won't want to but probably will.

In the essay, Do not exceed the speed limit published by Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics of the tuning affect the rider because there are old people who have been around for a long time and you cannot ask for advice because they are too old to give information and wouldn't know what they are talking about. " A best advice for solo cyclist would be : " Never accept the travel advice of a former collection that have not left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. " These are the characteristics of the frame and sample testing.       

<START>

 

The characteristics for the rough road cyclist are not the kind to be in the forts. I thought it was gonna be a landscape story, but it turns out he wants it prepared. He took directions from some older guys who hadn't left their house feeling Carter was in office. He was riding a bike by bike in the California desert with the things you can carry because you are on a bike. He ran out of water and could have heatstroke or collapse in the middle of nowhere with no one to save him. So the heat that goes away drives you crazy and makes you thirty and you have a bite to eat. The conditions in which this rider is on hormone and I don't think he was prepared. Always stay in your guts.               

<START>

 

In the story, there was no one around, there were no buildings, there was no water and was lost. Had a negative effect on the rider, he doubted himself all the time. Although he persevered and survived the difficult situation he found himself in.

In the story " difficult road to ride ", the setting and characteristics affect the rider. For example, in the story, he says: "I once read that sucking on stones helps to forget thirst by letting the saliva circulate that was left." This shows that the features are rough because he probably wouldn't be desperately thirsty unless it was really hot. The setting and characteristics of this story are that it takes place in California on a hot day. Another quote that might support the question is from the author: “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage. This shows that it is hot because he is sweating. It could also show that it is hot because he thinks it is a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot.        

<START>

 

In Joe Kurmaskie's “ Rough Road Ahead : Staying Within The Posted Speed Limit ” essay, the frame characteristics affect the rider in several ways. For starters, as the cyclist rode the first few kilometers, he saw nothing in sight. This made him less determined to achieve his goal. Then, in paragraph @ NUM1, the cyclist saw a building that helped him regain his strength to reach his goal. The cyclist's resolve waned as long as he was riding. But he finally came to a building that gave him relief and greater self-confidence.         

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider by dehydrating him and lacking time and energy. “ I calmed down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state ” This quote proves the cyclist's dehydration. “ The dazzling realization that I could die of heat stroke ,” this quote proves that the cyclist's time and energy are running out. These ideas and quotes show the characteristics of the frame of the cyclist.       

<START>

 

In the story Rough Road Ahead, the author takes a track he had already heard about. After the ride didn't turn out to be what he expected, the executive began to " settle in ." The aridity of the climate would oblige the author to fight against himself and against the conditions which surround him. Also, her lack of water was a problem to begin with. Also, his lack of water was a problem at first, but the scorching sun would make him dangerously dehydrated.      

<START>

 

The cyclist faces quite difficult challenges. The real lives of the set affected him, because there were so many optics that he had to overcome, for example, he received indications from some old men who were moving alive then did not really know what they were talking about. Then he ran out of water so he had nothing to drink and the road started to get bumpy and he saw snakes. There were no buildings or cars around, so there was no way he could ask anyone for help when needed. He happened upon an old factory, thought to be the Welch's Grape Juice Factory, but was abandoned and appeared to have been for some time, towards the end he discovered that this fish came where he finally got some water and was surrounded by people. These different perspectives affected his mood and determination.                         

<START>

 

The setting of "Rough Road Ahead: Keeping the Speed Limit" has a great effect on the main character of the story. At the beginning of the story, he passes the first "town" and continues to cycle, following the directions given to him by the old people. “ The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. " His mood at this stage was already confident, but it adds to it, words like" rush "encouraging. Then he continues to move on the road. "Within two miles of this part of the trip, I noticed the terrain was changing." At this point, he becomes unsure of the quality of the instructions he has obtained. Once he's already tired, the rolling hills aren't what he wanted to find, which adds to his doubt. Further on, he said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. “This adds to the desperation he felt, as he feels he is going to die in Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely disheartening, so the setting really affected him. Then he said 'over the long hill. crippling, a building appeared. ” That's when he uses the word“ crippling ”because he's almost exhausted and can't go any further.              

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. He walks through this deserted and battered town that makes him feel weird. After that he starts crossing the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more. When he arrives at the Abandoned Juice Factory, he's almost completely out of energy and barely able to continue his journey until he finally gets to the bait shop. Most of the features of the scenery scare the rider, but they all affect him.    

<START>

 

The cyclist begged to feel death coming as he continued with no buildings in sight. This made him hoisted on the situation and still has enough energy to feel sorry for himself. Then when he finally saw a building he thought it was a mirage.  

<START>

 

The location of a cyclist's ride affects a person's attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a bit more force to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes "It was a sad, desperate laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself." It shows how one is drained by the hills. Additionally, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst. The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try to pump out some water that looked " brackish ". So the tuning can break a rider.       

<START>

 

The adjustment in the passage works against the cycler. He's running out of water, he's almost dehydrated and it's very, very hot, and he can't see a city for miles. 

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as it was very hot outside, there was very little water and a long way to go. The temperature was so hot the cyclist said he felt dehydrated. He also had to climb many hills and cross deserts to get to where he needed to go. He took a "shortcut" but ended up taking longer and he became dehydrated. This is how the frame affected him.    

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in a good way. For example, he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport. He would be rich because he would win the cycling competition.  

<START>

 

In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, many obstacles are caused by the different settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to become dehydrated. He recalls, “ I calmed down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. “This caused the loss of resolve, which led to him losing consciousness. The hills he had to travel also affected him. They made him become tired and weak and also lose his resolve. Much like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually cause him to pass out. He said "if it looked like I was going to pass out for the last time."            

<START>

 

The setting of the story affected the cycle because if it were under-ears it could have stopped anywhere and had water, but the plot was in the middle of a desert and all he could do was keep riding and hope to find water For example he had to walk @ NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water and if he was not in the wilderness with hills he could have done it in no time   

<START>

 

The rider was affected by many characteristics of the frame. The flat road quickly turned into bumpy hills, which were made more difficult to cycle due to the lack of water. The scorching desert sun and the lack of towns and people also made the trip difficult.  

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider because it is too hot. It's hot enough that its water tastes like battery acid. Then he has to deal with tough trail breaks, he said, " elders who have not left the confines of their porches since Carter came to power." " This means that the elders gave him old directions. Plus, what made the scenery even warmer was that he rode his bike nonstop. Then, as he rode, he said, “ The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written on them. " With him thinking that, it made him forget the heat. This is why the setting affected the rider.            

<START>

 

There are many reasons why the characteristics of the frame affect the rider. One of the reasons is it's so hot, I know because it was summer in the California desert. Another reason is that the road was very rough. I know that from the sign he saw that said “ Rough Road Ahead ; Do not exceed the speed displayed @ NUM1). This tells you that the road is very rough. And being he's on a bike, bumpy roads aren't very good for him. Another reason the setting affects the rider is that there is no one to orientate themselves. There is no one around to give him a drink. These are just a few of the many reasons that tuning affects the rider.

The setting for this story is outside. Yosemite is out biking. It is around hills, no water and very hot lands. You know she's around the hills because she's like, " ... I maneuvered down the hill." " You also know that it begins about right ??? ??? good water. “ When I tried a drop or two it tasted like battery acid… ” which shows that the water was bad. In addition, the earth is very hot because it is written “ … in the ??? two hundred degrees. Yosemite starts off badly and then eventually learns to stick with it and never give up. Yosemite's biggest problem is her lack of water due to being hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid.

There are a lot of things that can affect the rider. Like when they said, " Grave weeds have crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake." " @ CAPS1 their example would be when they said" Not two miles in this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced with short rolling hills. This is how the features of the road changed. frame affect the cyclist.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. First, the river and the pines " The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written on them ." Thinking about it helped the rider keep going. Second, the road became more difficult to travel. “ The flat road has been replaced. through short rolling hills "and a sign on another road said" hard road to follow. "The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park. Finally, the cyclist's water supply ran out. was running out. "The water bottles only held a few mouthwatering sips ." Not having that much water is really bad when you are out in the heat and the cyclist didn't know where to get more. Cities that the cyclist does. He encountered were abandoned or “ ghost towns .” The cyclist had nowhere to go for help This cyclist encountered many problems on his bike ride to Yosemite National Park.

The older men gave him instructions which were really, really bad. Nature was not on her side, that's for sure. First of all, he ran out of water because of the heat. Second, a snake blocked his way and he did not want to attempt it. Third, he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. He also continued to go to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone his thirst leaned on got stuck in his throat, he was then led to a bait shop which was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way to go home.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider. The dry desert affected the rider as there was no water and the rider was dehydrated. The high heat, because the cyclist could bare had heatstroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and there was no one for miles to help him. In the story, it says, "There was no one in sight, not a bubble, car, or structure of any kind." If the cyclist had needed help, he most likely could have died. if I was the rider I probably would have given up by then but I'm glad the rider didn't. The characteristics of the scenery affected the cyclist due to the many things that could happen to him.

The frame characteristics that affected the rider were the heat as it was getting lost and it was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said: " You should never take travel advice from elders who haven't left their front porch since Carter took office ." This means that because the cyclist followed their advice, he got lost in the desert and ran out of water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to prevent him from thinking of water. In the end, the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to very old people who have not left their homes for years.

The desert setting is difficult to live with without water or help. If the author had been on a population line with water fountain and shade, he would have been fine. But, he was in the desert with no one around, hot, dry, without water and without shade. " Tumbleweeds have crossed my path " (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). This dicrides his loneliness because no one was in the desert to help him. The scenery could have killed him if it hadn't been for the fishing camp. The setting had a huge impact on the author.

The characteristic of the news affects the cyclist because in the absence of cities around, there is now water. In the story, it says: "The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips." This means that the cyclist was running out of water and had to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and in the hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or heatstroke because it said “ and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke, ” the buildings the cyclist saw did not help as they. had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the bathroom sink. The story goes, "I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply in the sink." This is where the setting changes as the rider finally finds fresh water.

In "Rough Road Ahead: Staying Within The Posted Speed Limit", the author faces many obstacles due to the various changes of terrain on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men, he made his way to his first stop. The old men said he would see a city, but what he really saw was some sort of ruined "ghost" town. Then he came to a fork in the road and ran out of water. He was driving on a flat road when the terrain changed dramatically. It became hilly and very irregular. This sudden change of terrain made him more tired, thirstier and hotter. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, descended. He was exhausted. All the changes in the terrain have not only changed the physical condition of the rider, but also his mood and determination.

The setting affects the rider in several ways. “The nass trip makes a snake this quote and it makes it look like he's in the middle of knowing were and not expecting plass because the man on the pourch said it wouldn't be too far. first town was also empty and when he saw the town he was excited to go and feel a little bit out when he approached he realized that the town had been abandoned all this time so he was forced to keep going out, the empty town made him feel almost hopeless.meet this next town, that's how the frame affected the rider the same way they did. 

<START>

 

The configuration of the road affected the rider in different ways. Since there were no towns on the route, it was very difficult for him to find water, which led him to become dehydrated. “The old folks had sworn that the next town was only eighteen miles down the road that I would save my water and go inside for about an hour. The rolling hills in the road made him use more energy. Because there were no buildings for miles, the journey was divided into short distances

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in many ways. Some of the ways the rider was affected was that the lack of water was the biggest problem he had. The group of old guys who gave him instructions wasn't much help at all. The men gave the cyclists the instructions they remember when they were younger. The cyclist knew not to be guided by the old men, but they seemed so sure of what they were talking to him. The cyclist initially had the determination to reach his destination. As he starts to get hotter and more thirsty, he gives up. As soon as he was about to let go of his troubles, thirst and fear were now behind him. He tripped over the water.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in different ways. One way is that it is stuck round with only a little water. “The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. (Kurmaskie). In addition, the cyclist was lost because of the instructions of the old men who let him know where, as these instructions were out of date. “Never accept travel advice from a collection of elders who have not left their front porch grounds since Carter was in power” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). He was giving the wrong directions and was not happy. Therefore, the cyclist went through difficult times.

Different characteristics of the settings affect the rider. The setting of the story, which is based in the desert, has a negative effect on the character. “The desert land is a baron, leaving it only its small reserve of water. During his trip, he lacks water, which makes him lose touch with reality. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to start hallucinating. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his journey. Much to her dismay, this turns out to be a mirage. The long drive also affected the trip. The length and roughness of the road had worn the cyclist.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting affect the cyclist as he thinks that after a nice afternoon at a nice campsite a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a good way to relax than taking the original longer path to Yosemite. But the trip he makes makes him change his mind a lot. In the essay, the narrator talks about what the old people told him. He said, "The old folks swore the next town was only eighteen miles away." I could do that. I would conserve my water… ”He conserved his water but the city was very old and had no water to drink. So, throughout the essay, the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, had water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing.

An answer that explains how the particularity of the frame affected the rider. Could it be in the context of the affected cyclist frame because for one the characteristics of the frame were based on something else. So that would be one reason why it would be affected. Because there are differences in the stories.   

<START>

 

You have always chosen your features because you believe the mind will change over time.

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider mentally, physically, positively and negatively. For example, the grape juice factory and the bottling factory of @ CAPS1 were made. A shortbread picture of a young boy could still be seen pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth. This affected the author mentally, reminding him that he had no water. Which affected him physically by becoming dehydrated over time. So overall, these tuning characteristics had a negative effect on the rider's steering. Another example, “A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that could not fit in the most lame mule greeted me. This sight was disturbing.” This affected the rider mentally making him think he was would never see civilization again. It also affected him physically because the water tasted like “battery acid,” which plunged him deeper into his dehydrated state. they affected the rider are like an environment in which a person is encouraged and how that makes him who he is.   

<START>

 

He goes on a trip on his bike. He has to come down from the hills and face the fact that he has no water. That's basically what it's all about in the frame.

When you ride a bike, the characteristics around you can affect the rider. Some things that can affect the rider are the weather and the scenery. If it is cold and rainy, the cyclist will not want to ride. The dangers of riding in bad weather conditions will make the rider a second guest: to ride or not. If the weather is extremely hot, the rider will become dehydrated faster and even more exhausted. The landscape can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and sees only a desert, he may have doubts about where he is going. If there are abandoned buildings everywhere, cyclist @ MOIS1 gets scared and wants to back up without losing hope, as the story “ Don't exceed the speed limit ” shows when he crosses a hill and begins to think that Yosemite will never get there. A lot of things can affect the rider.          

<START>

 

The features of the decor exuberate the cyclist. The June weather added to the water depletion, being the start of summer, when the cyclist "got to the first 'town'" it was deserted and the water was fine. disgusting water. The author uses verbal irony when calling it a city "city" The fact that it is no longer really a city. The great serpent presented an air of danger and another abandoned grape juice factory added to the your desperately lost. 

<START>

 

A lot of things in the frame affect the rider. The first thing that affects it is heat. Heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If heat was not present in the story then the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he could continue his ride without fear of becoming dehydrated. Another aspect of the setting that affects the rider are the hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause them to need more water. If these hills had disappeared, the cyclist would have pulled slower, making his journey easier. The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist.       

<START>

 

The features of the "Do not exceed posted speed limit" setting affect the rider in several ways. After following the advice of the elders, he sets out. After the first city appears, the sun really starts to beat, which really affects the rider. In the essay it is written “ The sun was starting to heat up, but I hardly noticed it. " It @ months.1 has not noticed yet, but later on the long winding road to the new flat, lacking water and it's really dangerous too hot. The text reads : "The speed limit was @ NUM1. I was doing a @ NUM2 which depletes water. In this part of the story it proves the rider is out of water. In this kind of scenery, you can meet dangerous creatures. In the story it says, "I worked hard. At one point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a big snake. It really looked like a diamond back that blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me. " This entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this kind of frame. The characteristics of the frame in" Do not exceed posted speed limit "greatly affects the rider.        

<START>

 

The configuration of the terrain affects the rider in several ways. The fast he was in a desert made him thirsty. There was no sign of water in the cities to quench his thirst. The hills he would cross compared to the warm city made him more tired. This is what the tuning did to the rider.      

<START>

 

In the story "Do not exceed the posted speed" of @ PERSON1, the rider faces problems caused by the tuning. The rider was riding and the heat was scorching and the rider was really dehydrated and tired and running out of water. Because it was so hot, the rider had to drink more water to replenish his body from all the sweat he was losing while riding a bike. The rolling hills of the terrain made it harder for the rider, giving him more energy and fluid to keep going. If it had been cool and windy, he would have had no problem walking that distance. If the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns, he would have had water to drink.     

<START>

 

Every body experiences physical and emotional pain, but probably wouldn't have survived what the rider in this story went through. The man started a bike ride in Yosemite National Park, but when older men told him a shortcut, his adventure was only cause. First of all, every "city" and "building" where men told him he would come, would come, ended up being completely deserted. At first it wasn't a big deal for the rider. In the fourth paragraph, when he arrived in his first dessert town, he "laughed, checked [his] town water supply and moved out." @ CAPS1, as his journey progressed, his water decreased. He was then desperate for a city. “It made his cycling more difficult and he would then become denied. He eventually found a city with water, but learned his lesson by taking advice from strangers and old people.      

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame would have greatly affected the rider. There is a man who takes the advice of the old men and takes a "shortcut" to Yosemite Park. The shortcut only makes him thirsty, and no park. The narration states, “A shortbread photo of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth was still visible (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). “This characteristic could affect the cyclist by discouraging him. The cyclist arrives at the first 'town' but again cannot find water, and a picture of something that makes him thirstier. It could also make him feel more thirsty. anger at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey. Another feature that @ MOIS1 affects the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could smell was the sun slapping on his back The narration states, "Large rings of sweat circled my shirt. (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). It also makes the cyclist believe that old people do not know what they are talking about.

Many of the frame characteristics affected the rider in "Do not exceed the posted speed limit", The time of year affected the rider as it is mid June, @ CAPS1 the area affected the rider as the mid June in Arizona is extremely hot and trying. If it was in a more northerly state at @ DATE1 or me, it wouldn't be so bad and your world wouldn't have the thermal struggles dance. @ CAPS1 when the terrain went from flat to hilly, it affected him because it made it more difficult to drive. Here are some characteristics of the parameters that affected the rider in " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ".

In Joe Kurmaskie's bad road, the peculiarity of the scenery affected the cyclist. Because he was in the California desert in June, his water supply was cut off and he came across a ghost town. His hope was diminishing because of it. He found a water pump that produced a tar-like substance as the desert and lack of water made him wish he was dead. He decided to never take the advice of strangers and trust his card. This is how functionality affected the setting.

In the test, " Rough road, a head does not exceed the posted speed limit ", the characteristics of the frame affected the rider. First of all, it was traveling in the @ CAPS1 which means it was very dry. This meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and slowly became dehydrated. Also, the cyclist was cycling in the heat. This meant he was sweating continuously, which also depleted his body of water and played tricks on his mind. Eventually, the hills caused him to demand more energy and make him more and more dehydrated. The hills also dampened his morale, which required him to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going. This part of the scenery affected him emotionally. Overall, the setting had a physical and emotional effect on him.

The rider travels alone on flat ground at first following the direction the old men told him to go to Yosemite National Park at @ LOCATION1. During his travels he becomes dehydrated while cycling over hills and deserts with more sunburns on him in such hot weather in June, he realizes he could have a crush without water . His travels are desolate and lonely and when he finally sees constructions that are true ghost towns, he recovers and finds a certain determination to speed up. The cyclist luckily found a campsite to avoid passing out in a desert where he could rest, draw water, and then continue his journey using his own map.

In the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the cyclist tries to get to Yosemite with the directions given to him by some codgers, or eccentric old men. The cyclist, the old men said as if they looked, "hasn't left the confines of their poachers since Carter came to power." “ Well he takes their advice and gets lost about @ NUM1 on his journey. While eagerly awaiting the "cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite," he was traveling through a barren wasteland. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." This type of setting could really lower the mood of a cultist when thinking of Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of finding Yosemite at this rate. If you have a nice setting, it's worth the trip and your point of arrival even better.

The adjustment affected the rider's performance and the rider's mood. The rolling hills the rider had to overcome likely made him more prone to fine and thirst as he had to put in more effort to overcome them. "on a long crippling hill, a building appeared." The long, tall hills he had to climb made him thirstier, but probably more full when it was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. It brought down his hopes. But kept moving forward. In my life, I have never had such an experience where I had to keep pushing and pushing towards my goal, but the closer I got, the more distractions kept me in and stopped me.

"Do not exceed the posted speed limit", is a short story about a man riding a bike through Yosemite and he asks old men for direction and they lead him on that "old" shortcut that takes him through a difficult terrain and extreme famine. The characteristics of the scenery affect the cyclist in several ways throughout history, for example when the cyclist arrived in a deserted area he said "there was no one in sight, not a building, a car or a structure of some sort ". At the time, he was malnourished and needed water. This extreme thirst also claimed it as he walked past an abandoned Welch grape juice factory with an advertisement featuring a young boy pouring a glass of fresh juice into his mouth. He says "In an ironic twist that should appeal to all the sadists who read this, the building," then he explains in detail the building, that mood and feeling at that time was tired and exhausted and the publicity didn't not help the situation at all. The mood of the writers changed with the setting and before it got better it was worse.

The young rider started his day confident, looking forward to his day riding slowly through California, but when he recognizes he has been misdirected his mood changes and he begins to feel more desperate. As he begins, he feels carefree and mody about everything. He writes, “ I checked, checked my water supply and continued. The sun was starting to go down, I hardly noticed it. The environment has little effect on him. Later, he realizes that his water was dropping, and he tired, his mood changed to exhaustion and failing. Here he writes "I got back on the bike, but not until I picked up a few pebbles and hopefully put them in my mouth, I would have hit a lodge one lump in my throat." He became sarcastic or saddened by the despair of his trip. Eventually he got the relief of the cold water which helps boost his spirits and his sense of humor.

In the test, the frame characteristics affected the rider. At first the scenery was with the old man and the rider was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and ran out of water, he was overwhelmed and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived, but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store, he was excited and relived. This is how the frame affected the rider on his journey

The weather, the places, the will to continue, so many reasons which explain how the characteristics of the frame affected the cyclist. First of all, the weather will affect the rider because in hot weather you lose a lot of water and sweat a lot, which makes pedaling difficult. Hot, sunny weather will affect his willingness to ride. I mean, come on, who wants to ride when it's really hot outside of the places the rider has been through like cities and bumpy roads would affect him because it's quite difficult.

The story "Bumpy Road Ahead: Stay Within Posted Speed Limits" tells about a bike trip gone wrong. But the story does is not as terrifying if it took place in a different place. The decor plays a big part in the story. The story begins on a present-day summer evening, but as the man is riding his bike he arrives at the ghost town devoted to an evil life, then a feeling of double sets in when he arrives at "a dilapidated shed." , several rusty pumps and a corrol that could not contain them. most crappy mule. ”Later we fear panic will set in as this terrain becomes hilly and weeds and snakes cross the path. Like a cold western. Eventually all hope is lost when he reaches these grapes at the juice factory and finds " a shortbread picture of a young boy.

In the story "Rough Road Ahead: Staying within the Posted Speed Limit", by Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics of the frame affected the physical capabilities of the riders. The characteristics affected are abilities, as the climate and hazardous environment were hot and difficult to deal with. . These lines were hot and rough "Since he was in the deserts of California in June. The passage that supports it is". sidewalk in front of me. I went through smoothly, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. In addition, the characteristics of the decor give it determination. They give him determination, because every horizon he sees gives him hope. They give him hope since he knows he's at this point @ NUM1 in Yosemite National Park. The passage that supports it is when it falls, "The distances I could see on the horizon, telling me @ CAPS1 could move it that far, it would be fine." In the story, "Rough road ahead , Do not exceed the posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics of its parameters affect both the physical and mental capacities of cyclists

The characteristics of the frame have a huge effect on the rider. There was a time in history when he ran out of water and he remembered the old folks swearing the next town was only eighteen miles away. He was tired and dehydrated, but he thought he could do it along the way. So he set off and two miles later the terrain changed, as did his vision for this whole trip. “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills. "Sometimes life can be so cruel." The hills of @ CAPS1 demanded a lot of him and he was now on a freeway. Before this change of terrain, the cyclist is very positive and thinks he can do it easily. "I could do it!" But after the change of terrain, he loses hope and hardly succeeds. "It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean." It is obvious from reading that when the terrain gets rough it has a huge negative effect on cyclists.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. The roads were nice and smooth then turned into hills. It was a hot day in June and he had little water with him. He was peddling in the California desert. The last thing that affected him was that there weren't many places to stop for water.

In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is on the way to try to find his way to the Yosemite National Park, but encounter some problems when he gets the route of a couple of older men. . The only lesson the cyclist learned was never to listen to the shortcuts given to you by extremely overwhelmed old men who have not left their purch since Carter took office. The cyclist learned this the hard way when he got lost and almost died of thirst. The scenery takes place in the California desert or in deserted ghost towns. On his trip, the cyclist said, “ ... I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. " This characteristic affects the cyclist because extremely dry heat that struck him make dehydrated. Also during his journey, the cyclist encounters hills. The peculiarity of the scenery affects the cyclist by tiring him and making him believe that there is no hope that he will make it out alive. Scenic features such as hills and deserts dehydrate a

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. It seems that the more desperate the situation, the more demanding it becomes. Pg @ NUM1 (I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean). Right after thinking about it, he left for the abandoned Juice and Dreams factory. He says that pg @ NUM1 comes from trouble, thirst and love where everything is behind me, it shows that after a situation the bilaver says he is aware of all the earthly obligations. Not only do the settings affect the rider but the whole story around them.     

<START>

 

The setting of the story is very dry and wet, flat and hilly. The author noticed that the terrain was changing, “ Flat road. Has been replaced by short rolling hills ”(Joe kurmaskie). To be in the middle of a dessert like surrounding in June, and nothing surrounding it is a scary thought. The heat and lack of water affect him, as he may have mirages, or he @ MONTH1 passes out, from the heat and the amount of fluid he has lost. The hills don't help either.      

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the cyclist as it crosses the desert in mid-June and yet it has very little water. It affects him because he is thirsty but he doesn't have much water to drink and he is in a desert in mid-June which makes him very hot. Also in the story it is said to come to the Welch grape juice factory. On the side of the building, he sees the photo of a "young boy pouring a refreshing juice into his mouth". This makes the rider even more thirsty but continues to find water in a bait shop.

The cyclist in this trial is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He has confidence in himself to succeed, without realizing what awaits him. First come the windy roads. As he moves forward, his confidence begins to crumble. The desert hits him like a rock because he lacks water and needs to rest. The extreme heat only makes things worse. “ Not the mile traveled in this hot section of the route, I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. “It shows that the cyclist did not expect to encounter this kind of terrain and is delighted with it. The only thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before the climb, he found a place to draw water and relax. “Then, as easily as running, my troubles were thirsty, and they weren't all behind me.” It shows he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and that made him happy and had a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined.

It gives him a hard time so he learns a lot of things that he knows are not always easy. It's not a big deal, but sometimes a little problem gets bigger. Life is like riding a bicycle.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. He had to ride in difficult conditions and became very exhausted. I believe the most difficult feature of the setting was the heat. He told us, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. He was talking about how he needed to sip his water more than usual. Another difficult feature of the setting was the hills it had to go up and down. As he drove, he said, “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills. " I think through these hills in the hot @ DATE1 in a California desert was a very difficult task for the cyclist. I think the terrain affected him a lot.           

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting of this story make the race more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist travels through the “ … high deserts of California… ” (kurmaskie @ NUM1). This shows that the rider is at a high altitude, which makes it more difficult to breathe. Then the cyclist notices that the " flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills " (Kurmaskie @ NUM1 ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. Evidenced by the cyclist describing one of them as a " ... long crippling hill ... " (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). Obviously, the terrain, which was becoming more and more difficult, negatively affected the rider.                                       

<START>

 

In the story, the setting has affected the rider in several ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It went from a flat road to short, hilly roads. Weeds crossed his path. He was running out of water, and the water he got tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, "I calmed down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."      

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as if you have to climb a hill or along long bumpy roads. Then in the essay it says “ A difficult road : don't exceed the posted speed limit : @ CAPS1 makes things harder than average. Especially with a lack of water to make matters worse.     

<START>

 

The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First, the cyclist says he's in Lodi, Calif. On a " beautiful day in June ." It is very hot in California in June so the rider is affected by the weather as he could die of heat stroke. Additionally, he finds himself in the middle of the desert, where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path with a large snake which are possibly poisonous on the way. This despairs him even more, because he could be injured by a wild animal, or run out of water with nowhere to go for more! Thus, the adjustment mainly negatively affects the rider.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider; the author says he is in the California desert. This means that the rider should conserve water so that they can stay hydrated for the trip. In addition, there are a lot of hills, as the author says, “on a crippling hill…” with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist consumes more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he is not. careful. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several kilometers from each other. It affects the way cyclists use his water again, he thinks there is a prosperous city ahead, so he drinks his water, thinking he will have more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he has to cycle several more miles to the next town with very little water. The tuning is a big effect on the way cyclists behave especially without water.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting in " Difficult road: do not exceed the posted speed limit " greatly affect the rider. Depending on what type of new terrain or landmark he has arrived at, his resolve increases and decreases. For example, when he saw a building appear in front of him, he got excited and used all of his energy to walk down the hill to the building. Plus, when he got to the next building and found a working bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The man who rode the bike in the story had many changes in his emotions during his long ride through this story that depended on the setting.

The author concludes the story with this because gardens cannot grow with snow on the ground. So she thinks that when all the snow is melted, she will try to grow another one. I feel like she wasn't happy enough to grow another garden. I think she should be more interested in cultivating it than disappointed.

The narrator has this in the paragraph because everything makes sense and everything goes together. The narrator says that when the bushes come out and the hibiscus is budding, it is because it is another spring.

The author concludes the story with this passage to show the importance of the inspiration Saeng derives from the hibiscus plant. Saeng, throughout history, has been comforted by the hibiscus plant because it reminded her of her home. The factory during the winter explains metaphorically: @ CAPS1's attitude towards his new country and his driving test; the hibiscus in winter is not as beautiful in the freezing cold, but it adapts and survives, and returns to its beautiful state in the spring. Saeng is bitter about his new country and his driving test, but adapts and will take inspiration from the beautiful condition of the hibiscus in the spring to retry his test. In conclusion, the author ended the story in this way to emphasize the importance of the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus.     

<START>

 

The author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows a change. Snowmelt represents the transition from cold to hot. The return of the geese represents new life as a return to something semi-new. Just as the author returns to drivers ed. The budding hibiscus represents growth. The author will be older and more knowledgeable and more skilled than before.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph from " Winter Hibiscus " because it brings us back to things that happened in the story. Saeng has already failed the test. In spring, the hibiscus will bloom again. Saeng realized that a lot of things she found strange were almost familiar to her now. The cries of snow geese were almost familiar to him. The snowmelt will tell him that it is now spring. Some of the things that could happen with the arrival of spring could be that @ PERSON1 will pass the test. Her mother will be proud of her. In addition, Saeng will start to get used to his new country and new surroundings and stop worrying about his life in Vietnam.          

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because he meant when saeng will retake the test. The author told the hour with the spring season. In the spring all the snow melted and the geese and the hibiscus sprouted. And this paragraph makes it easier for the reader to understand. This is why the author included this paragraph in the story.    

<START>

 

The story ended with the author saying, "When they return, saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is upset that she spent @ NUM1 on a plant that she felt was different from the plant at home. She declares that she is not going to take the test again to buy one until the geese and the Hibiscus buds return.  

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps conclude the story. In the paragraph, she basically says that when the geese come back and my flower is budding, I will be prepared enough to take the test. She will be prepared because she will be sufficiently adapted and she will have experienced enough just like the plant and the geese. She compares her life to the life of geese and the life of her flower.   

<START>

 

The author would end the story with this paragraph because she has already failed the test and wants to pass it. One wonders if she will pass it or not.

In the story "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho, the story ends with a good ending. In the story, the young girl buys a Hibiscus that she has left from home. She comes home and tells her mother that she failed her test but bought the plant. While she was planting it, she saw geese and she remembered her home. America was like home and she was happier. In the text, she says, "a lot of things that she once considered strange had become almost familiar to her now." She is ready to retry the test and is sure she will pass it. America is now starting to feel a bit more like home.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story began when Saeng failed the test, went out and bought a plant to comfort her, and confessed to her mother. The plant was linked to her by memories of her homeland and when she failed this test she felt very depressed and sad. She cried to show her pain and bought a plant to cheer her up. As she told her mother, she felt the pain again, but her mother prepared her favorite food and helped her to plant the plant. She knew it wasn't like the old plant but it was the thought and the memories that she knew she couldn't give up, so when the time was right, she was going to try the test again. It relates because it helps readers understand the story better and shows that she wasn't just going to quit. Her mother was very understanding and when she takes the test again, she will be ready. This is how it relates to history.       

<START>

 

I think he concluded the story with a paragraph because he then does something in the story and brings it back so that when the geese are gone, they'll come back and go again for what I think I'm doing again. the test means.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when it all starts again, it will pass the test. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's sense of determination. When Saeng returns and shows his mother the hibiscus plant, she is very upset, with tears in her eyes. The mother offers to help Saeng plant the hibiscus, which comforts Saeng a bit and helps him develop the determination she needs to recover. The story says, "Almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of things she once considered strange before had become, thanks to the silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar to her now." This quote indicates that Saeng realizes that things at home can be the same as in his new country. The author uses the term "familiar" to express that Saeng is starting to accept that some things @ MONTH1 are different, but eventually she will get used to it, which will make her outlook on life more positive.      

<START>

 

Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because in the paragraph there are a lot of things that are the main part of this story. For example, all the names and talk about the seasons and the comparisons and differences and he talks about different budding, like when you get your nuggets and your buds from the plant. Because hibiscus is a new form of some pretty @ CAPS1.  

<START>

 

He declares this as a conclusion because it shows the faith she has in the flower and how it will bring her luck for her next test. She feels that the familiar flower is out of place as it is and that she can relate to something. 

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with Saeng because it shows when she remembers home. I believe she thought she might pass the test when the flower bloomed and reminded her of her home. For example, Saeng muttered, "Not like the kind we had before." This suggests to me that she was probably sick at home. Then when spring comes and he blooms, the flower might give him the strength to pass the test. That is why I believe the author has finished with this paragraph.     

<START>

 

Arthur uses it because Saeng regained his confidence by planting the hibiscus and everything that happened that year. So now she's ready and that's what Arthur wanted the reader to understand. 

<START>

 

the author concludes the story this way because Saeng failed the test, the hibiscus comforts her and she feels like geese. For example, Saeng says “ I failed the test ”. She admitted to having failed the test and is upset about it and wants to "take this test again". The familiarity of the plant comforts her and will allow her to regain the courage to "take the test again". Finally, at one point, Saeng thought to himself "the silent repetition from season to season, which is almost familiar to him now. Like geese." Saeng thus feels like geese and it allows him to decide to take the test "when the snow melts and the geese come back". The author concludes the story forcefully, describing how Saeng failed the test, how the hibiscus comforts her, and she feels like geese.        

<START>

 

I think the author ends the story with this paragraph because she will remember her homeland and return home. The reason I say this is because the geese are coming home and she wants it. Plus, the hibiscus will bud in the wild just like at home.  

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph by teaching Saeng how to be confident and make a wish silently. there is no more snow in the spring, she will retake the test she failed. Her mother was very upset when she found out that Saeng had failed the test the first time. 

<START>

 

They probably ended it like that to create some suspense or to leave the reader on a high note because someone @ MONTH1 thinks things are going to get better for them and Saeng @ MONTH1 is getting his license. They @ MONTH1 get more money.

 In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus”, the main character, saeng, faces many obstacles as she tries to adjust to her new country, which is very different from her home country. The author chooses to end the story as follows: “When they return, saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again.” @ CAPS1 l The author wanted to end the story in this way to assure the reader that saeng has found new hope, symbolized by the hibiscus flower. Now, with new hope dawning , the flower also has sentimental value, about her home. , the best way to overcome your obstacles is to hug them, like she did in the greenhouse, and then that leaves room to start from scratch.            

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to say that just because you fail once, you shouldn't give up. From what has been said that the paragraph, it was implied to me that Saeng will become stronger in the spring and be able to pass the test.                                     

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all things have routines and things they must do to survive. Geese fly @ CAPS1 during warmer months so they don't freeze to death. The flower dies in winter and resuscitates in spring. This concerns Saeng because when the geese and the flower return, she will do the test of trying to fit in, in her new country, which is why the author chose this to end the story.   

<START>

 

In the story “ Winter Hibiscus ”, the author ends with the last paragraph specified : “ When they are back… then I will take this test again. " Because it leaves many unanswered questions that the reader might have. The reader might then want to read their next work. Basically, the last paragraph catches the reader's attention. most of the unanswered questions revolve around “ I failed the test ”. We do not know either "his sweet grandmother", "Madame Lambert", and "the house". Another reason the author can end the story with this paragraph is to have an effect on the reader. The reader need only assume and imagine things to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What's going to happen ? All we know is " when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, then I will retest ." most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader. Therefore, I believe the author of "Winter Hibiscus" finished with the specified paragraph.                      

<START>

 

I think she ended the story like that because it means she gets used to all the seasons. "In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hisbiiscus is budding, then I'll take the test again." " It will do and will do the test once it does it will be colder, so it will wait for the geese return, which will be spring by then. I think she's also trying to say that when the snow melts and the geese are here again, she'll have passed the test and passed it. It's I think she ended up like this because they mean something to her.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how everything changes and adapts to change. Saeng decides that with this change, she can also adjust to her new life by coming back and passing the driving test. The hibiscus also represents how something from its native land came to America and must now survive. When he begins to bud, Saeng will begin to adjust to America by passing his driving test. It's about trying to get used to the changes. When Saeng feels bad about failing, that's why something from her past is such a comfort to her.

By ending the story with the idea of taking a test again in the spring, the author gives the feeling of starting over and persevering. for example, when the author says "when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding", she shows the idea of starting a new life in the spring by returning home and the hibiscus starts again in budding again. That's why spring is the time when saeng wants to start over and take the test again. The paragraph also shows that saeng, like hibiscus, is persistent. Hibiscus persists in overwintering and blooming again while saeng persists in retesting. The author ends with this paragraph to show that saeng is not going to give up.

Concluding the story, it thus shows Saeng's growth and his greater willingness to strive and do his best. When she says she will take the test again, it shows that she has gained confidence and is starting to feel comfortable in a place that is not her home country. She is striving and working now to do her best to be successful. And she makes the most of the given situation. The author thus tries to give more depth and meaning to the study. Saeng has gone from being nervous and worried, saying, "I failed the test," to now setting a goal to retake it, when the bud blooms next year.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted to show that just because saeng failed this test does not mean that she gave up. She said when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take it back. what the author means is that she failed at the moment, but over time she can study and learn more to prepare to take it again. And by the time she's ready to take the test, the snow is gone, everything should be warm, the birds are coming back, and the flower is growing well. she will take it. And how the author finished it lets us know she's going to take it, but how he uses the words lets us know that she will not only take it but pass it too.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus has started to bud and she is happy now. So she says that after the geese return and the snow melts, she has to start all over again. 

<START>

 

The reason the author of the story "Winter Hibiscus" ends it the way she does is because we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time around and it has been less than a year since I took the test myself and no matter how many times I fail the test I will never give up. We must preserve through all the problems that we go through in life. If we don't and give up, we'll never do anything in life. She swears in the spring and when the hibiscus buds, she will retest. I hope I pass my driving test the first time, just as I passed the learner's license test. Moreover, you cannot give up anything even small something like working, if you stop working you will lose your job. Never give up.       

<START>

 

the author added this line to the story to show how much Saeng cared about snow and plants. She says she prefers gardening rather than schoolwork. She loves to plant new things.  

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place where she is . Later in the story, she recounts how "many things that she once considered strange had become, through season-to-season repetition, almost familiar to her now." This quote means that most of the things she considered strange now she is slowly getting used to which means she is adjusting. So the reason she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes in the spring the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, “then she will pass this test again.” Therefore, the author puts the conclusion on l story because it shows how she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.                

<START>

 

The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator sadly purchases the plant, after failing her driving test and missing her house, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower blooms, so will her hope and she will try again, perhaps this time with success. Right now @ MONTH1 is sad and scary, but she knows things are going to be okay and she will be okay. She finally settles into her new life and says that "a lot of things that she used to consider strange before have become almost familiar to her now." She means that even though she misses her homeland so much, she is slowly getting used to her new home and her new life. And maybe in the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to retry her driving test. The hibiscus represents both longing for the past and hope for the future.       

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is more comfortable when surrounded by things from her native country. She thinks she'll be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again, and when the hibiscus begins to bud. The narrator says "A saebya, tall and tall, had surrounded their garden…" @ CAPS2 is proof that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well reminds him of this. The narrator also says, '' Overhead, a flock of geese @ CAPS1, their weak seems clear and -yes-familiar to Saeng now, '' @ CAPS2 proves that geese also symbolize the @ CAPS3 house.       

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes with this quote for a variety of reasons. One is to show that the character isn't just going to give up, that her failure wasn't the end for her. It shows sorting like the morale of never giving up. It feels like the character is referring to hibiscus in such a sane way. " The hibiscus will bud, " which means that it itself will branch out and learn more. In the spring, she would have learned and experienced enough to try and pass the test again. The hibiscus also reminds him of his home. When she looks at him, she will find the courage to pull through and take on his challenges like her test. The ending quote also concludes the story. It also shows that the characters are determined not to give up and always to try.            

<START>

 

The author uses this concluding paragraph to bring the whole story together. She talks about the driver's license, geese and the hibiscus plant, three subjects that can be found in the story. when she says "when the snow melts and the geese come back" she is referring to the geese mentioned when she says "She lifted her head and watched their distinctive V burn into the evening sky". She went through a change, much like geese do every winter. She realizes "that many things that she once considered strange had become ... familiar to her now." We all have to go through changes, Saeng has just undergone a bigger one.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wrote the same thing that he had in the paragraph and he wrote it in his story but adding a little more detail and problems and things.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how respectful Saeng is and how his homeland is missed. First example when "Saeng silently swore to herself", it shows how much she respects and misses her homeland. Having said that, she wants to try again about her failure in the past. The last example where she wants to overcome her past failure. The last line of the paragraph says “ then I'll take this test again ”. He says she wants another one. Chance on his life. These are the example of the author who concludes the story with this paragraph.         

<START>

 

The author had concluded this story with this paragraph to make it as if they were on a clean slate as if they had started over. Thus, the past no longer haunts them. Saeng seems to have a little relief after taking his mother's plate. I think she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she seems sure of herself. She looks sure she looks like she wants to start over because she says "when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again". To me, she looks like a whole new person. Who forgot the past.    

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when it comes home after having passed the driving license. So she says when all is well. She will take the test again. The driving test isn't important to her, but she won't pass it, so she wants to retake it when the plant she bought is budding and at its best.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grown from this experience and how determined she is. This final paragraph follows a sudden, happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader the role of knowing that mom's character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng's family having to move to a new country and start all over again. However, the only thing that serves as an escape is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a beautiful garden and very much enjoyed enjoying it. Now that they are at @ LOCATION2, their garden and the plants it contains remind them of this homeland and what life was like. Although saddened that she didn't pass her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvenate her on how to pass the test. The last paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she has confidence in herself again due to the happy memories she thinks about.       

<START>

 

The author used the last paragraph because the hibiscus is a symbol for the saeng. This shows that she will be ready in the spring. When the plant is ready to bud, it will be confident that it can pass the test. She will probably want to take care of the plant before taking the test. When the plant is bad, saeng will no longer have to take care of it.    

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because Saeng says when the right time comes, she will try the test again because she failed it. eg on the @ NUM1 page at the top She "I took the test" that's why I think the author concludes this with the story because it was important for Saeng to take the test at the right time of the season Spring. 

<START>

 

“Winter Hibiscus” is about a saeng girl, who moved from Vietnam to @ ORGANIZATION1. After failing his driving test. She goes home and finds a hibiscus. “She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. The familiar scent filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost smell the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair… ”She goes to a florist to see if it can be bought. She pays a lot of money for the plant because it is rare and valuable. It's special for her because she had hibiscus plants in Vietnam. She brings the plant home and tells her mother that it reminds her of Vietnam. Mom says it reminds her of Vietnam as well. Mom is not happy with the price Saeng paid for it. She plants it in her garden. When the hibiscus was driven into the ground, a flock of geese walked past. When the hibiscus returns in the spring, saeng will retake his driving test. In the spring, all the flowers begin to bud and bloom. Everything is new again. saeng will have another chance to pass his test.                

<START>

 

I think that included this because it compares to a flower. When it grows back like a flower, it will prove itself. She says there is always a second chance. She wants to tell everyone that it's to be missed or a mistake. For example, “They said there were a lot of things she had thought about weirdly, season the season.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story like this because she wants everyone to know what she thinks about the hibiscus. She felt that the hibiscus was a wonderful plant. She described it as " soft and cool towards the end of the first page." When she first discovered the plant in Vietnam, she thought it grew wild. Then, when she saw it in the United States, she was surprised that it was growing in a pot. For example, she described the smell of hibiscus as a "sweet smell". @ CAPS1, that's why she concluded the story like this; because of how it feels about the plant.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this statement because it shows Saeng's passion for gardening. She's ready to take the test to see if her plants can grow in the spring and if the hibiscus starts budding, she will try to grow it, which shows how anxious Saeng is about gardening and trying to grow. hibiscus during the spring. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story by saying that when everything is back to normal and beautiful, that's when Saeng passes the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she enjoys working in the garden in the spring. It also means that Saeng feels like she does better in school in the spring. The author concludes the story by saying that when everything is back to normal and beautiful, that's when Saeng passes the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she enjoys working in the garden in the spring. It also means that Saeng thinks she does better in spring school.    

<START>

 

Change and disappointment are enough to overcome. Some people have an arid fear of change. For Saeng, the main character of "Winter Hibiscus", the change comes in the form of a move to @ LOCATION1. Everything around her is different and new. Coupled with the disappointment of having failed her driving test, the feeling of living helpless overwhelms her. After purchasing a winter hibiscus plant, she swears to retake the test when it blooms in the spring. The resilience of the winter flower and the memories it represents prompts Seng to try again.      

<START>

 

I think the author wanted to express Saeng when she made a wish and express how he felt. When the statement was made, I think it was also to get readers interested, but mostly to help understand. 

<START>

 

For shading, future reference, continuous behavior, all are reasons why this is the last paragraph. Well, they're for watching because they're telling you something that she says she's going to do in the future. She tells you what she plants to do in the future, so she refers to what she plans to do in the future, she keeps the behavior from before, so she says she will start the year again next, that's why I said continuous behavior. She said, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is buddin, then I'll take that test again." So for observation, future, baseline, and ongoing behaviors are very good reasons why I think what she is saying is good and these three things best describe what she said and what she said. said the snow was going to do next year.           

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuity in life. In the story, Saeng takes a "test" and fails. She goes out and buys a hibiscus plant for way more than she should have paid for it. Her test is trying to overcome the memories of her real " home " which Saeng now only cries when she thinks about it. For Saeng, the plant represents memories and a life that she once had, but no longer has, but she wants it back. Her wish is that when the geese come back on her, she will return to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home and will try once again to say "home" without breaking down, and without having something extremely dear.       

<START>

 

In @ CAPS1 Ho's "Winter Hibiscus", the narrator never makes it clear which Saeng test failed. However, through the choice of subject and words, it is clear that the test is not only important for Saeng and his mother, but also for his new life at @ LOCATION1. Throughout the story, Saeng's desire for his homeland is too strong. The flood of memories that came back to her when she bought the hibiscus, are obviously painful and are part of her daily life. Saeng works hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, knowing that she has to learn to live the customs and way of life @ CAPS2. There are things she doesn't need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her mind alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentence of the story is so powerful, because it has learned to use @ NUM1 things together, memory and change, "when [] this hibiscus buds, I will take this test again"           

<START>

 

The author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. Saeng missed his house. It was difficult for him to say his country of origin without crying. "It's not like the wind we had to-to-be." She also spent @ MONEY1 on a plant as it reminds her of coming home. One could between her adapt as she was familiar with the change of seasons and this indicates that when the geese come back, she will retake the test.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes Saeng feel more comfortable. For example, he says, " The snow is melting, and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, so I'll take the test again." “I think the author says this because everything in that sentence reminds him of his home. For example, the goose plant are things that she had at home, so when the winter is over she will feel better and pass the test.     

<START>

 

The reason the author ended up with vowed Saeng is because she is very committed. She failed the first time but know she really wants to succeed so she waits for the snow to melt and the geese to return @ CAPS1 and this hibiscus is buddin @ CAPS2 she will come back 

<START>

 

I think the author concluded the story like this because of who threw the whole story the plot was in winter. She might want to try it out in a different season to see if she could do better with the setvation. That's why I think the author concluded the story like this.   

<START>

 

I think the author ends the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really wants to say that she will take the test in the spring. I say this because she says that when the snowmelt and the geese come back, that is, next spring, she will retake the test. She says it with confidence because she has started to add more. For example, she added “ the hibiscus is sprouting ”. Saeng is determined to pass the test just by what she says. That's why that was the last paragraph and what she meant by it.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding so I will do this test again, because it says there will be a new year. For example, it failed the first time, she will wait until she tries again. Another example that she just wants to try until she gets her driver's license.    

<START>

 

In this story, Saeng shows her mother how passionate she is about planting and her passion for plants. The author includes the paragraph in the story so that it can show what Saeng's character thinks about his plantation. One of the reasons this shows that she has a passion for planting is that it says "I will try this test again", which means that if she does something that she enjoys doing, she will try it over and over again until she is fully satisfied.  

<START>

 

The authors conclude this in the paragraph. I think he concluded this because it shows a lot of self-confidence. For example, when she said, " then I'll take this test again ." It sounded very confident and made it where she may want to try if she or he fails the first time around.

Hope, a new start, an adjustment, so many reasons why the speaker concludes by saying "when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will go over this again. test". The hibiscus flower gives this girl hope because it reminds her of her grandmother and of home, how wonderful things were there, and by the blooming of the flower, she realizes reckon it might wear out there too. She will also have a fresh start in spring, by spring she should adjust to her surroundings and have new friends, things to do and new memories to look back on, what to look back on about everything. default will not be as bad as the flower will bring him hope and comfort in his adaptation.

The author says she's doing nothing, says it's a beautiful day outside. Also, she wants it not to be that cold, but not that because she can go out and play with her children. Then she said she would retake her test for a nice day outside for her.

The author ends the story with this conclusion to show that @ PERSON1 is very passionate about connecting her life in the US, how life was in Vietnam and bringing them together in some way. another one. In the story, @ PERSON1 recounts how she misses home and how she is still trying to adjust to her new life away from home that she knew, when saeng says she failed the test and wants to taking it back, she means she wants to show that she can survive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When saeng spent @ MONEY1 on a plant, his mother was in disbelief because Saeng knows how difficult it is to survive. When the conclusion says, "I will take the test again," it shows that Saeng is ready to try to get to the United States from Vietnam, proving that she can improve her life and that of her family by working hard. While keeping alive the traditions in Vietnam. Saeng just wanted her new home to feel like Vietnam by buying a plant that she knew her mother would like.

The author could have concluded this story because it looked like a fall. Which means that at this moment he is at the bottom and that he must reach the top. He's going to start over and retake the test, but this time he's not going to fail.  

<START>

 

The author had concluded his paragraph thus for emotion. This last paragraph is emotional knowing that she cannot garden in winter. In winter, all of its plants die for the season. 'The author is just saying that saeng is coming back. After the snow, frost and cold are over, Saeng will come next season so that she can continue with her gardening, plants and soil. Like said "I will do the test again" saeng. This means that saeng will come back and pass the stress test with her gardening and mom next time / next season when she starts growing again.

The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng found hibiscus. As the Saeng factory will overcome an obstacle. She will try again for the driver's license and the plant will win. The harsh and brutal winter months . The plant will bloom in the spring and show its restraint during adversity. Saeng will also overcome the adversity she faced when she failed her driving test and realized how much she missed her homeland. Saeng too, in a sense, will flower in the spring. Winter, representing her contempt and homesickness, will not present her to live happily and pass the test. The hibiscus reminds him of the. The story ends with the paragraph to show how the "Winter Hibiscus" taught him something about how to overcome obstacles.                             

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng will come to terms with her new home and recognize the similarities of her old home and keep close memories to help her overcome the obstacles she faces in life. "I've seen this genus blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't quite as pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the cold months here, that winter hibiscus. That's what matters." This establishes similarities between their old home and their new home. It shows that things are changing but that they are also the same. This leads to the conclusion as this is where Saeng tells herself that she will always have the memories of her old home and that she will use them to help her overcome the issues she is going through.   

<START>

 

The author ends the story as she did to show how similar Saeng and the hibiscus plant are and how Saeng will overcome his obstacle when the plant overcomes its obstacle. Saeng's obstacle is adjusting to his new life and the first step is to pass his driving test. The reader knows she must be successful because Saeng tells her mother, “ I failed @ NUM1]. The hibiscus must survive the winter, it must also adapt to a new environment to survive, just like Saeng. The mother said to Saeng, "... but it's strong enough to get through the cold month here, this hibiscus winter. That's what matters" [@ NUM2]. So if the work of the winter hibiscus, or the hurdle it has to overcome, is to do it, to stay alive during the winter months, then its work will be done in the spring. The author ends the story with Saeng by saying to himself, "… in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again" [@ NUM2]. If Saeng's hurdle ends, and passes the driving test, and she passes in the spring, just as the hibiscus passes its "test," the symbolism between the two, showing a spirit determined to embrace, will deepen as it will adopt and pass their obstacle at the same time.        

<START>

 

I think the story came back to that because that's where the story begins. It all started with Saeng going to take a test but she didn't pass it. So when the weather is better, she would have a hard time trying to pass this test. This is how I think she came back as the test.   

<START>

 

If the author concludes the story in this way, it is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspense: to want more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng approached her mother, she told her that she had failed the test.   

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph, to give an overview of the following story. I think there will be another story because there are clues to support my theory. Right at the start of the paragraph when they come back. Then at the end of the stay "then I'll take the test again. I didn't stay happily ever after at something similar, it's just stating the changes personally mentioned. So I think the author will write another story. so that we can see if Saeng will pass his test.     

<START>

 

The author ended with this paragraph because it's an example of how everything gets a fresh start in spring. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph in last because it's a metaphor for how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will have a new chance to pass his driver's license just like the plant and the geese will have a new chance at life. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph because these returning geese symbolize Saeng's determination and hope that she will have to pass the driver's license. She will wait until the end of winter to pass the test. The arrival of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth. Saeng will once again have the chance to take the driving test with renewed faith and encouragement. This is a great way to end the story because it is really deep and makes the reader think about the sense of the scene and how the geese, the hibiscus plants, and the onset of spring affect the conclusion of the story.    

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to say he goes @ CAPS1 uP in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back. Also I think the author likes the spring scenery too to see the sunny sky a goose floating in a @ CAPS2. I would also like this setting because it gives me more ideas and it's a very pleasant setting to be around. This is why I think the author chose this paragraph to conclude the story.   

<START>

 

The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is about a girl who moved with her mom to @ LOCATION1. The story tells about the transition of the girls into the different culture. Throughout the story, the author refers to the girl having to take a test. At the end of the story, the author wrote "In the spring ... then I'll take this test again." In the text, the girl says “ this is not a real one ”, referring to the winter hibiscus plant that she bought. The reader might deduce that this quote means that the girl has memories of the house, but they are not real. In addition, the author wrote "... by far preferred it to the Big Mac". This quote shows that she misses her own culture and cannot adapt to the @ CAPS1 culture she lives in now. In conclusion, girls are testing @ MONTH1 because she needs it to be able to handle change and also be able to recall memories of her homeland with happiness instead of sadness.        

<START>

At the end of the story when it says "when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I will take this test again", (Ho) the snowmelt, the geese return and the hibiscus in grass symbolize adoption change. Saeng will need to change and adjust to a new life in order to pass the test and feel better. That's why author @ CAPS2 Ho, of the story " Winter Hibiscus " used a strong, symbolic, and purposeful ending to his story.

After Saeng fails her driving test, she loses hope for the future. The sight of the hibiscus reminds her to never give up, no matter how difficult the situation. In the story, Saeng's mother says, “Her flowers aren't that pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the cold months here, that winter hibiscus. That's what matters. ” This quote shows how even though it is not an object of beauty, it can do whatever it takes to survive. Saeng feels that she is also like the hibiscus, having the strength to be able to survive in a new environment. Even though she is new to this country, Saeng has proven that no matter how big the situation, anything can be overcome if you believe in yourself and your family.

In this news, Saeng promises to take the test again in the spring because she knows she can pass it once she accepts to live in this new place. After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family and way of life. This prevented him from concentrating on the test. However, once she realized that flowers are also beautiful in her new home, she began to embrace the changes. The geese that are familiar to her symbolize the fact that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this wish because she didn't want her mother to be disappointed with her again. After seeing his mother's disappointment and loving kindness, Saeng was determined to pass the test. When Saeng retakes the test in the spring, she will be ready as she has adjusted and accepted her new life.

So, she collects the seeds from the plants and plants them so that she can go to her test drive when it starts to flower. She failed.

The author closed the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obstacles, and the next time she has these reminders, she will be successful. When she says "almost reluctantly she has realized that a lot of things that she thought were strange before had become ... almost agricultural for her now" and that means she is getting used to the changes in her news. life.

In the story " Winter Hibiscus ", the author concludes the story with the paragraph for several reasons. One of the reasons is that she is trying to overcome the change and wants to improve the situation. She tries to do this by taking the test again. The author also concludes with the paragraph because she is heartbroken that life is not going the way she wants it to and she needs to do something about it. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show you whether it is determined or not. Whether she's going to stick to it or not.       

<START>

 

I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because she will see if she can adapt to the new country. It's a good way to end the story because you don't know if it will or not; it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I also think that's a good way to let it go because he could write a sequel and make a series of it.

Although @ MONTH1 misses her old life, her grandmother, the well and the fine tooth comb, she makes an effort and '' redo this test ... '' By detailing the test, she shows that she doesn 'is not ready to give to' '@ CAPS1 of loss.' 'and her grief.               

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that whatever happens is likely to come back again. Just like he said the geese, the geese will come back every year, so he says without hesitation that it will come back. That's what I think.    

<START>

 

I think the author made this concluding sentence because it means that when Saeng is ready, she will take the test again. I think it compares to snow, snow geese and hibiscus. I think so because she says when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. So I think she says she's not ready for the test and when she gets ready, that's when she will take it.   

<START>

 

The author's conclusion to the story shows how Saeng interpreted the experience of that day. She uses a spring setting to show off when her confidence is reborn. Seeing her hibiscus bud in the spring will give her a newfound integrity to try this driving test again.  

<START>

 

Hope, positivity, help are all reasons the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First, the last paragraph gives readers the feeling that Saeng has hope. I felt she had hope because she is ready to take the test again. As she is going to retake the test, she wants to help her mother. Second, the last paragraph gave me the feeling that Saeng has a positive attitude. She bought a flower to replace the dead flowers, and she said she would take the test again in the spring. Third, Saeng is helpful to his mother. Saeng finished digging the hole for the new flower for his mother, so that her mother could go and cook dinner. Saeng also saw the feeling his mother had when she found out that Saeng had failed the test. She therefore repeats the test. Saeng was feeling pretty much what any other new child probably would have felt. She was scared, but through it all Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and she was helpful.             

<START>

 

For her, the hibiscus was a test. Saeng felt that she had failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing the " now ". The hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent more money there, knowing that she and her mother needed the money. Basically, she felt like she had failed a test.     

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One of the reasons I think they also end the story like this is because she knows inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow, she will be strong, so she will not pass her exam. conduct. For example, when she said, " When the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again." This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus” story, the main character Saeng and his mother left their homeland for this new place, where everything was different. she was having a hard time adjusting to this new place, and Saeng failed an important test. She had been very disheartened by this, and she was trying to remember to be home. She bought the Winter Hibiscus to remind her of her home, but when she planted it, she became very determined to try and adjust, by doing the test, when the hibiscus budded. The author concludes by saying that there is hope and determination for Saeng to adjust to his new home.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it adds the uplifting message that Saeng will be able to overcome the obstacles of living in an unknown land. First of all; geese @ CAPS1 represent a piece of her new home because she "reluctantly" reasons that they are familiar to her now, it portrays her ability to adjust to her new surroundings. Additionally, she also equates spring as the time habiscus is budding and habiscus is a symbol of itself because the two of them are trying to live in a country that is not their own. Therefore, habiscus budding represents his ability to live comfortably at @ LOCATION1. Finally, she swears that she will retake her driving test. Her initial failure to pass the test showed her inability to be part of @ LOCATION1, but if she passes it. It will then have adapted successfully. Overall, the author of this story concludes with this paragraph because it contains the theme of passage through an uplifting message.

In Minfong ho's “Winter Hibiscus” story, the ending includes the budding hibiscus and the retaking of the test to tie the two together. Geese are also included at the end to show the new country she has adapted to as she recognizes when geese come and go. Hibiscus budding is much more to her than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life in her, just as flowers tend to bud in spring. This is also why she chooses to take the test as her "budding" will take place in the spring, and she will have a newly born confidence for the next test. This is why the geese, the hibiscus, and the test are all included at the end of the story to show the connection between his old home and his adaptation to a new way of life.

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause. Saeng didn't think the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and that when she came back all of her plants were gone snowing, so she said she would take that test again, which means that she would start again at the first steps of her plants and flowers.

"When they returned, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." The “winter hibiscus” story ended with this paragraph because it will be a new beginning for Saeng. It will be spring and the geese will return to her house where she now lives, which now has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home. The paragraph also compares Saeng to hibiscus. In the story, his mother says, “I saw this genus blooming along the lake. His flowers aren't quite as pretty, but he's strong enough to get through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters. ” Saeng is the winter hibiscus that's odd enough to overwinter and failing the test won't matter until spring, when she takes it and passes it. . It is depicted when the hibiscus is in bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it relates to Saeng's feelings throughout the story of his new home and her old home. It also shows her ability to overcome obstacles. She will forget her failed driver's license and work to pass it in the spring.

The geese in this paragraph represent the mastery of time. The plant will bud when the geese return in the spring.

There are many reasons the author chose to end the story with Saeng promising to retry the driving test. At first the story begins with a tone of sadness and seeing fact "As Saeng returns home after failing her driving test" this quote sets the tone for sadness as she failed a very important test and she walks alone. "She sees a familiar plant" is when hope returns to the story. When she brings the plant she bought here to her mother, she also sees it extinct. "where did you get it?" his mother asked, and Saeng replied, "I bought it." She bought it for @ MONEY1 more than her mother said for all the seeds in the garden. Over time, it became clear to her mother that the plant signified strength and hope for her daughter. I felt it was a waste of money, but when @ CAPS1 saw her, I also loved her. When Saeng's mother felt touched by the plants, Saeng was happy and gave her courage for the driving test. This is the reason why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng promising to retry the driving test.

She became stronger because she adapted to her new home and to her new surroundings. Saeng is more confident to take the test again. She doesn't want to cry anymore, like she did during her last test. Being more confident and adjusted is the reason she's become stronger, and the reason she wants to retake the test is because she's stronger.

Confidence, perseverance, memories - all the things Saeng has " that help explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng left her own country, she was not very happy, she was upset at pretty much all the time and everyone misses and @ CAPS1 from Vietnam ; @ CAPS1 that she sees reminds her, that last paragraph, where it says "then I will take this test again", shows that she is confident in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully she won't give up, Saeng almost misses @ CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. He also misses his family and his appearance and dress.

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to prove his point. I think Saeng compared himself to the flower. For example, the flower was originally a wild flower, and then it was planted in a pot. Saeng was a happy and free girl, but then had to move to @ LOCATION1. Fleur and Saeng feel like they are out of place. Since in the story, Saeng is similar to the flower, then at the end then at the end of the story, I think Saeng thinks that if the flower can survive the winter, she can survive @ LOCATION1 and she can pass the test. That's why I think the author finished with this paragraph to get his point across.      

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story this way is because he wants to show that Saeng is determined not to fail this driving test.

@ CAPS2 I will take the test again. First @ CAPS2 because she failed her test first, so it takes courage and the power to go back and even try it again.

I @ CAPS4, she keeps wanting to take this test because she has had so many great memories with her grandma and never wants to forget them. But again, it comes down to the willingness or desire to go back and take the test a second time. Last All the Hard @ CAPS1. All Hard @ CAPS1 because she knows what her grandma told her and threw away all the things or Hard @ CAPS1 that her grandma has seen and wants to honor or appreciate everything her grandma has done for her.

The author adds the last paragraph to show that she still has hope. this is the last sentence because @ CAPS1 fong Ho wants to show that when all seems lost and you are at the end of the line, you can always hope for better when spring comes, as well as a fresh start not only for the saeng plant but also for his life in another country.

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" chose to end the story with this paragraph to reinforce the theme of the story and conclude on a hopeful tone. The theme of the story is to adapt to new circumstances and make the most of each change. “Saeng silently swore to herself,” tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life. The hopeful tone that is created is a way to show that Saeng is ready to accept changes in life and wants to do her best to overcome obstacles. She said, "I'll take this test again." The test represents the obstacles she will overcome when the efforts are applied. The hibiscus in the sentence "... when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding ..." @ CAPS1 starts over. The budding hibiscus is compared to Saeng with a fresh start and a determination to achieve his goals of adapting to a The author chose this paragraph to conclude the selection to highlight the theme and symbolize a new beginning      

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the audience can then compare the saeng and the hibiscus. After reading this statement, I realized that saeng and hibiscus are alike because they are both going to come out and be victorious (Saeng gets his license and the hibiscus offer) @ CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with this statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working towards his goal and will not give up. Saeng silently swore to himself: 'I'll take this test again'. Finally, I think the author concluded the story with this statement as it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what will happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to complete as they wish. For example, i know saeng will take the test again and think she will pass, @ CAPS2, someone else reading it might think she failed again and that she had to iron it again.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to enable the reader to compare the girl to geese and hibiscus. The geese are leaving for the. winter and come back in the spring, but the geese also show how the girl will come back and take the driving test again in the spring. The hibiscus dies during the winter and begins to bud again in the spring, this shows that winter is its weakness. Like hibiscus, the young girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by remembering her homeland. The author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so that you can see that the girl is like geese and hibiscus.

I think the author concluded the story with this sentence because it shows that she will mature. She said she wasn't ready for all the challenges she was going to face. For example, she didn't pass her test but instead of crying about it, she just said I would take it again next year. In the story, she also yearned for her homeland, which she really missed. She coped with this by purchasing a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her grandmother in general. The main character displayed depth and maturity throughout the play.

The author concludes the story as it does because it shows Saeng's willingness to adapt to his surroundings, just like hibiscus. Saeng needs to adjust to his new home at @ LOCATION1, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the coming winter. Saeng swears to herself, "When the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding ..." @ CAPS1 from there you can tell Saeng has hope for herself and for the hibiscus. At first, Saeng was very reluctant to accept his house. She says of the hibiscus, "it's not like the kind we had before." But she realized that the hibiscus could be a home reminder as well as a reminder to change to her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive by living in a new place.

The author concludes this story with Saeng's promise to retake the test again in the spring, as Saeng is struggling to adjust to her new home, and she won't give up on fitting in after just one failure. . Remembering her home and the fact that she will never be able to return there are painful thoughts for Saeng and the memories help her cope with her loss. The hibiscus and other familiar flowers she found comforted her because they reminded her of her home. In the spring, when the geese come back and the hibiscus begins to bloom, Saeng will again feel ready to take the test, spring is an opportunity for a new try and a fresh start.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the last paragraph. The author chose because the sentence informs you that Saeng will retake the test. In paragraph @ NUM1, Saeng tells her mother that she failed the test. So, by the time spring arrives, the hibiscus will start to bud and Saeng will retake the test. In addition, the geese temporarily left the house because of the snow. So she kind of compares herself to geese because she misses her home. The geese will return when the time is right, this is what the author concludes in the story paragraph.

Her mother will be proud of her and it shows that Saeng will never give up. Just like when she said 'let's plant it, now', this example shows that even though Saeng failed the test and disappointed her mother, she will never give up and she still has hope in the plant. , just like her, the mother has hope for Saeng.

Saeng wondered when everything would come back how would it be with the return of spring, when the snow would melt how things would be, the geese coming back and she would take the test again, she had silently promised herself.

" Finally and history, this leaves the reader breathless because he does not know if the geese return. The author seems to show the reader that Saeng is starting to adjust to his new country and do it like his old one. For example, when the mother said, “I saw this genus blooming along the lake.

She can't wait to take the test in the spring as she would have been so alone to stay and she @ MONTH1 passed the test in the spring as she did not pass the test the first time she took the test. Maybe she ended the story with this paragraph because she @ MOIS1 loves spring and can't wait for it to come.     

<START>

 

I believe there is a valid reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author will feel more comfortable and ready to take the test. I was able to come to this conclusion because while waiting for the end of winter to retake the test, she is giving herself time to prepare. In addition, she waits for the hibiscus plant to sprout. Something. I was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus to be the presence of comfort, the whole story revolves around how saeng was able to take comfort in recalling her past experiences in Vietnam. When she feels that an important part of her life is coming back, she can feel comfortable and concentrate. I think the author would end the story with this paragraph because the author wants to stress the importance of this flower involving the way saeng lives his life

And the hibiscus inspired Saeng to do well where she is. So this is a new start for Saeng, after all his learning of hibiscus.

The reason I think the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows how the character matured and how the character grew in his situation. This shows that just because you failed once doesn't mean that you are going to fail again. Plus, it's okay to feel out of place, there will always be a point in life when a new beginning will begin, so it's your choice to take this chance or be stuck your way, but the decision is always up to you. .

In the new " Winter Hibiscus " from " Minfong Ho ", she ends the story by saying : " When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, so I'll take this test again. " I failed the test ." Like many children, Saeng failed her driving test and is deeply upset. no one wants to fail at something and it is almost a humbling experience to have failed a test. knowing that others have already passed. Along with the quote in the opening paragraph, or the one in the question, it was written as a symbol of symbolism. When the geese come back north, it is to show that they are ready to "start over" or "try again". When the hibiscus is budding, it tries to " start life again ". Saeng seeing objects doing things over and over again makes him want to succeed and try again. She realizes that this is part of life and that to be successful you have to fail. Minfong concludes with this quote because she understands that whatever the obstacle, you have to go ahead and keep trying in order to be successful. She realizes that success can only come with hard work and commitment, and that is what makes a great and strong person.

<START>

 

The author concludes the ending as "I'll take this test again" meaning that the things she's going through now will happen again, but next time she'll be peperd. Saeng finds it very difficult to move to another country and get comfortable where the mother supports her as she goes through the winter. this cookie she bought when she was in bad weather, she got through the winter with the hibiscus and in the last paragraph of the story express "when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding" she thinks about the line and how she " saeng silently dedicated herself to spring. She can't wait for winter to be over and is just waiting for the arrival of spring.

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does when she gets back in the spring. This means that when she returns, she will take care of the plants. When she receives herself again she wants to melt the snow and everything. This is what the author tells me about the story.        

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to assure the reader that she will repeat it. Additionally, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life there will always be something and or someone to make sure of everything. The author also wanted the reader to feel a sense of similarity to the character, which meant that no matter how out of place you feel, it's still something you can relate to.

In this story, the author decides to end the story with this paragraph, "When they come back, saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will do this. agien test. " because she wants to take the test when all is well, for example she wants everything she likes in her nuform like flowers, geese and the if. Another reason I say the author ends the story with this paragraph is because she wants to be, an environment like she was in her home country eg there was no snow it was as if time passed all around. This is why I say that the author ended the story with this paragraph.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by memories of her homeland and truly appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, it cannot pass the test until it is. “almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of the things she had thought about before had become through repetition enough season to season, almost familiar to her now. ” It shows how much she truly believes in beauty. about her homeland and tropical plants because she thinks of other times when things were weird in the winter and better in the spring and seasons @ DATE2 when the plants are budding, so she thinks she will pass the test of conduct when it feels comfortable, when the plants have budded.

Geese that fly south for the winter and budding hibiscus are normal things for Saeng. The author wanted to end the story with this to show that Saeng felt comfortable in the things that she was used to. Saeng wanted the geese and the hibiscus to be there to make him feel more comfortable during his driving test. Saeng still longs for home and doesn't quite feel out of place in America. The plants in the greenhouse along with the disappointment that she failed her driving test brings her back to the emotional state she was in. In the penultimate paragraph, the author talks about the feeling of repetition Saeng felt upon seeing the v-formation. Saeng feels that in winter she won't have the same feeling of comfort as when she can see the hibiscus and geese flying above her head. It is said that when Saeng arrived at @ LOCATION2, she had nothing familiar to her. Now she gets that feeling of geese and plants. The author concludes by saying that Saeng will take his driving test at the end of winter is a good conclusion because it gives you a glimpse of what Saeng is going to do.         

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the sentence then they come back, Saeng swore to himself, in the spring, when the snows are melting and the geese and this hibiscus are budding, then I will take the test again "is that because that was the winter and the school was closed, when the geese come back it will be spring, so it will be time to go back to school, I think that's the reason.

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the author concludes his story with a strange ending. “'When they come back,' Saeng swore silently, 'in the springtime, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding. then I will take this test again. ' I believe that beyond the literal sense, the author shows how Saeng is adjusting to the new country. By failing her driving test, she also failed to adapt and accept the new country. Vowing to try again also shows that she is ready to give the country another chance. “She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home. I think it shows that she still didn't consider this country to be her home. She was still stuck on her past.           

<START>

 

The author concludes this story in the paragraph to show that saeng won't stop, just because she failed the first time. It also shows that she isn't going to get down on some things. 

<START>

 

The last sentence in a story is usually the most meaningful. I believe the author ended the story this way for a number of reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes: "I will take this test again." By using the word will, the author shows the determination of the girls. She didn't say she would try, she said she would, no doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new beginnings. The story quotes: "When they come back ... in the spring ... I will take this test again." This shows that in the spring, the new beginning of life, she will pass the test. That's why I think the author ended the story this way.         

<START>

 

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" made a good choice to end the story with "when they come back, Saeng swore in silence, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that test again. This paragraph suggests to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old life. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she was used to the constants of her home. The geese symbolize her new life and have become “almost familiar to her now.” The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author suggests that in the spring when the old and the new part of Saeng's life will be combined, Saeng will be able to overcome his " obstacle " and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng's life will have come full circle.

In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he points out that Saeng is ready to take the test again when he returns. I also think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story the @ NUM1 until the last paragraph says: from season to season she is almost familiar to him now. This sentence shows me that @ PERSON1 is slowly getting used to the new location. Also how she changes her mind about the plant and the fact that while it's not the same, it can still make sense. Therefore, I think the author made a good choice in ending the story with this paragraph.       

<START>

 

The last paragraph says "in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I will take this test again". I believe the author has ended with this paragraph to state that when her new home is like her old home, she might feel more confident and more out of place, instead of a cold winter in there. opposite of where she lived. The feeling of her old home, in her new home, will make her more positive and comfortable. Then she will pass the test feeling at home and pass.

In the story "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture, then she will have the courage to retake the test she failed that day. Her home is so missed by Saeng, and she can't fathom that there are similarities between her new home and her old home. "She realized that a lot of things she once considered strange before had become, through the silent season-to-season rehearsal, almost familiar to her now." Saeng didn't want to expect the move, but noticing that she wouldn't forget any memories, she began to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her. "She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Gradually starting to gain self-confidence and she knows when she does it, she can move on. test and pass. The author shows how good change can be if you are willing to adapt. Everything may not always be as perfect as you think, but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, as Saeng begins to savor over the last paragraph.      

<START>

 

The author is simply stating the obvious in this brevity story. This extract mainly means that when spring comes, she will return to the greenhouse or to the area with all the plants. When she gets there, the girl will try to play the part of the plant that grows wild in her home country and bring it to her new home.  

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this kind of paragraph, I think he is trying to show the saeng as the type of person to not give up and always keep growing like the hibiscus. And because she realizes that most of the things she once considered strange had become, thanks to the silent season-to-season repetition that was almost familiar to her. Saeng remarks that she will still have next season when the plant has sprouted and the geese fly in a distinctive V again.

She's trying to say that when all she believes in is successful is when she's going to take her driving test. Her mother says the flower is never going to give up and she is strong enough to get through the winter. The geese will always come back. This is exactly what she is going to do with her test. She's not going to quit the test, she's going to keep trying until she passes.

<START>

 

Saeng feels more comfortable in spring because it reminds him of his home. She has probably never experienced snow or winter before. So nothing at this time of year reminds him of his home. In the spring it does, as the geese come back and the hibiscus grow back, making everything feel right at home again. Confidence is what she gets when spring returns.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story " Winter Hibiscus " with this paragraph because it sums up all that the hibiscus gave Saeng for his strength and courage. Like hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in this new country and hibiscus helps him realize the importance of adapting to his survival in order to live happily. She cannot always live in the past but learn to love the place where she lives now. Therefore, when the author writes, "In the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again", it is a direct symbol of Saeng budding or opening. from his mind to @ CAPS1, like learning to drive.     

<START>

 

I believe the author of "Winter Hibiscus" used this for the last paragraph because he says that seeing this hibiscus will give her back memories of home, which will encourage her for the test. “The geese symbolize Saeng's determination to pass the test and try like the new country. Saeng explains, "She lifted her head and looked at their distinctive I was etched in the evening sky, slowly fading into the @ NUM1) this quote creates a vivid image in my mind that lets me know that Saeng will really pass this test when she is encouraged not only by geese but also by hibiscus.

It gives you a feeling of hope, that all will be well with her. Also, that she will start to get the most out of life. I believe this is saying that is why I think the author concludes with this paragraph.   

<START>

 

The author uses this paragraph for @ CAPS1 the story because it shows how Saeng wants to adjust to this country and she is already starting to understand and like it. When it @ CAPS2 "and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again" This is a metaphor on itself when the @ CAPS3 starts to bloom and @ CAPS4 Just like it starts to bloom and @ CAPS4. This is why the Author ended with this passage.

Saeng said that when the tree she bought starts to bud, she will pass the test. She means that without this plant, she just doesn't want to take the test. She doesn't because the plant was with her all of her life. She also thinks she can't do it without this plant. Saeng means that since she's had a plant like this her whole life, then she thinks she needs it, but I don't think she really needs it. I guess it "comforts" her.     

<START>

 

The author didn't think Saeng was ready to take the test until she found out more. Saeng had a lot on her mind to garden as she didn't have any friends at school, she didn't want to go and wouldn't have anyone to talk to, that's what Saeng swore because she wouldn't know. never whether she would do good or bad, so the author realized that Saeng will pass the test and pass. 

<START>

 

The author concludes with this paragraph mainly because she wants to highlight her memories of her native country by saying that she would retake the driving test next spring. This is due to the fact that she knows that as soon as spring returns there will be a lot of memories that will come back to her because in the spring the animals come out and the trees bloom, which allows her to retake the test with the support of she. memories of his country.

After reading the story “Winter Hibiscus” by: Minfong Ho, the author ends the story in a unique way that demonstrates a will to survive. For example, in the text, the author writes and explains how the plants " dok faeng-noi ", has adapted to its cold environment is different from those of the house. This demonstrates the idea of survival by the fact that in the past this plant migrated to a place that seemed warm at the time, but when it was cold in the streets, it found ways to change and dress. adapt while relying on the survival instinct. Another example in the text is author Saeng who thinks that in the spring she will try to take the test again. It demonstrates the will to survive because when Saeng failed the test she felt a sense of melancholy and failure. The fact that she had the courage to prepare for the test in the spring shows how this human being wants to live and for her to live in a new country she has to adapt by passing this test to become a survivor.

The author concludes with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings him comfort and confidence. “She's almost familiar to him now. " This quote from history shows that things start to go well and begins to comfort her by making him realize that where she lives now may be similar to where she lived. When around the hibiscus, it brings back memories of the flowers they had where they lived. Mother and daughter both appreciate the flower they found because it looks like the one they had at home. For example, in the story, the mother says " Her flowers are not so pretty, but they are strong enough to get through the cold months here ." This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclusion, the author concludes this story with this paragraph because it helps readers understand the importance of the memory of girls from where she lived.

The author chose this ending to show that saeng has not yet given up on the way she lives. It shows that although she really loved her hometown and felt and remembered a lot back then. She had passed the test and failed, living where she lived, so it seemed too much pressure on her then. Although she hasn't quite adapted, she will do her best to overcome the situations placed on her. It gives the reader hope by ending the story like this, instead of just leaving the reader to the fact that she bought a flower after failing a test and moving on with her life. For example, when she failed the test, she appeared distressed and very angry. I, “I failed the test,” Saeng said. For a long time mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng didn't dare look his mother in the eye. Instead, she looked at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, causing it to fall apart. When faced with a challenge, extreme emotional situations arise. Saeng just needed hope and the author chose this to betray the reader so there is a chance to hope!

She swore this because just as the geese would come back, she will. also as the test themselves to learn and grow, she would. Plus, she @ CAPS1 the test of love, survival and family tridition, she would know what to come. the back was fate. For example, they come to raise their young for the journey that they will have to face and Help them realize that they will always come back because their life started there and always exacerbate the cold and the man who wants to harm their life.

The author concludes the story "Winter Hibiscus" with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story, adapting to changes in life. So much has changed for Saeng, and she hasn't fully adapted to her lifestyle yet. Yet she learns that she must be determined to adapt and survive like Hibiscus. The text reads: "In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding." The hibiscus teaches Saeng to never give up, as the hibiscus does not give up and survives through the winter. She is learning to be determined and even though she failed the test the first time around, her memories have helped her and she will do it again. These ideas are in the last paragraph because they sum up the idea of not giving up even if you don't feel like you belong. She slowly got used to this new place and now recognizes the seasons as she thinks about that last thought.      

<START>

 

To set the tone and talk about their appearance. Moreover, this small paragraph can also start another book or get you to study things. He could also compare your life with the life of geese. How to explain the hardships you went through.   

<START>

 

The author chose to end this story this way for several reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you clues about Saeng's homesickness. He relates this to the fact that the flower is strong enough to survive the winter months. Which means she will survive too. Although the flower is not the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and at least she could hang on to it. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant that she will survive and try to adapt in the spring as well as her driving test.         

<START>

 

The author concluded like this because he is the one who marked the lines below what you are writing. Level score and key better. To all he was surprised to have been kindly parted over there, so bless yourselves with a sewn top of willpower until the end of the authors concludes  

<START>

 

I believe the author included this paragraph to show you that she didn't give up, to show that she kept trying after failing. Saeng told his mother, "I failed the test." Also to make her proud and happy to try the test again. I also failed the test. I also said I would take them back but I didn't. So the author put that in them to show how good it was going to sound.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it lets the reader know that there is still a chance for Saeng; she does not give up on herself or the test. As you read on, you will find that Saeng is comforted by the memories of her homeland, and obviously moving to another country was hard on her. In the story, the author writes: "It was smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center, just as she had expected." The feel and smell of the hibiscus flower comforted her. She then proceeded to purchase the plant because she had failed the test, she needed something to cheer her up once more. The author decided to end the story with Saeng by stating that once "this hibiscus plant buds, then I will take this test again" because, as the reader should have learned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the only positive aspect of his life since the move. It motivates her to take the driving test again, and it also lets the reader know that Saeng isn't giving up.

Minfong Ho concluded the “ Winter Hibiscus ” story with a strong paragraph to show Saeng's passion and willingness in his new home to complete the test. When the closing sentences state that Saeng "swore" to pass the test, it shows his determination to fight. This will could have come from her grandmother's memories and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home. Saeng's courage to face his homesickness is the seed of the story, and ending it with such a bold statement, Minfong Ho turns this seemingly sad story into one of will and willpower to pass his test. “Winter Hibiscus” is a passage of heartache, despair and longing for a past life. By closing the story with Saeng's uplifting promise, Minfong Ho brings a happy ending to a possibly sad story.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this because the season ends and also the story ends.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this type of paragraph because the author knows it will happen again. I know this because in this paragraph it is written “in the spring …… I will take this test again”. She's just getting ready for next year. That's why I think this paragraph ends with the story.   

<START>

 

Saeng was thinking to herself after dinner about the test. She knew she could do a lot better than before. And she took an oath that when winter was over and spring started, she would take the test again, and this time she would pass it with flying colors.  

<START>

 

Saeng wants to take the test again when the weather is nice and the hibiscus is buddy. The plant shows the great success of passing the test. The plant will help it pass the test by being strong, resilient and well finished. These characteristics represent the girl and the flower. It's been a good day and wants to take the test on the same day. The plant was strong and resilient. It represents the girl at the time when she did not pass. She told her mother and was very understanding about it. The plant represents beautiful things and the geese represent beautiful things. The girl wants to do it at this time of the day and thinks she will have it next time. When she's finished and passed her test, she wants to return home to a beautiful setting to remember that day. The author concluded with this statement to represent the importance of the plant and the environment as it wishes to pass the test.           

<START>

 

The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph, as it wanted to remind the reader how sincere "Saeng" was about the hibiscus flower. I say this because throughout history @ PERSON1 was very compassionate towards the flower. I think she felt like she could relate to the flower.  

<START>

 

The author ends with this paragraph because it symbolizes a new beginning, Saeng said, "I - I failed the test." She is also very sad, she is committed to making a new start in life, as everyone does every spring. The theme of the story is when life seems difficult to take a new approach. She intends to retake the driving test.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng will be ready to take the test on time. It must first grow and adapt to the new environment. Just like the hibiscus flower and the geese. The hibiscus flower must now adapt to its new environment outside the store Geese are adapting to the environment by flying south for the winter. Saeng still needs to learn more and adapt before he can pass his driving test. Ending the story with this paragraph shows that Saeng is realizing what she needs to do. She needs to stop thinking about where she was living and start her new life in a new country.      

<START>

 

Minfong Ho ended his story "Winter Hibiscus" with an optomist sentence. She concluded it this way because the main character in the story was starting to lose hope. Saeng decided to take the driving test again when his hibiscus flower was in full bloom. This flower reminds him of his life spent in Vietnam with his grandmother. "Saeng could almost smell the light strands of her grandmother's long, gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it with the fine-toothed buffalo horn comb." She preferred her life in Vietnam than hers at @ LOCATION2. She was going to wait until "this hibiscus is budding", to feel more comfortable and happier. The author wanted to end it so that Saeng would be happy.       

<START>

 

The author ended the story with this because it is sad and wants to give the reader hope that you should never give up on anything, always keep trying. Also it ends on a good note, if it felt like I was standing in my @ CAPS1 crying it wouldn't be a good ending. This ending gives the reader hope and also tells him to practice. Indeed, at the end of spring, the lady will be training to drive. So when she takes the test, she will want to fail. In addition, the girl becomes happier at the end and that makes the reader happy. So in conclusion, the end of the story has a good choice for many reasons like making the reader happy, giving the reader courage to never give up, finish practicing something if you fail the first time. Also to help your mother when she plants or digs up plants,      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to develop the theme and project what the main character will do after planting the hibiscus, I believe the theme of this story adapts to changes in life and the author builds on this theme in the last paragraph. In the last paragraph, the author writes: "When they return, Saeng silently swore to himself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." The author shows how Saeng learns to adapt when things change in his life. In this case, Saeng fails her driving test and to deal with this setback, she buys a hibiscus to remind him of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning of the test once the geese ??? (THIS @ CAPS1 IS @ CAPS2)     

<START>

 

She therefore did not forget to take the test again.

<START>

 

Saeng did not give up. She said she would take it back and then she could pass it. You won't always get your first try, sometimes it takes a while. Saeng encourages you to never give up just because you didn't understand it the first time around. She also gains self-confidence. This is why the author concluded the story this way.     

<START>

 

The author ended the story with Saeng's paragraph promising to retake the test again in the spring, as he wanted to show that geese and hibiscus represent some kind of rebirth or renewal for Saeng. He wanted to end the story on a positive note. Spring is a hot season. It is a season of birth and growth. Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing the first test. It brought her back to her memories in Vietnam, which gave her comfort here, she thinks that maybe when she sees the plant bloom and the geese return, she will experience the same revival again.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the last paragraph because Saeng failed the test at the beginning of the story. After going through the plants and learning new things, it is natural for Saeng to retake the test in the spring (end of story). I think this because Saeng learned that she had to get used to hanging on to @ LOCATION1 and the plant remained what it should when she saw the geese flying in the "V" formation, it was the same as at home in Vietnam. She realized that it was the same as in Vietnam and that she has to take this driving test again to get used to living at @ LOCATION1 with all its changes. I also think his prayer to finish the story with her by passing the driving test in the spring because the geese will come back, and the hibiscus is budding. It is the beginning for them as for Saeng.                                                                                                                         

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph which shows that Saeng is willing to try again to try and get a plant that will remind her of her grandmother and remind her of her old home that she @ MOIS1 will return to someday. Thus, she can see the nearby flower that she likes and not the one to take .       

<START>

 

In "Winter Hibiscus", the author concludes the story as he does to show that Saeng does not give up. In the spring, she will see the plant and remember her home, which will help keep her from feeling homesick. “Plants that she didn't even realize she knew but had forgotten brought her back to her childhood work. " This quote shows that when she sees the familiar plants, she remembers from her home. So in the spring when her plant blooms, she will see it and feel more comforting and comfortable, which will help her find the strength to pass the driving test. So, as the plant blooms, its comfort level also increases.    

<START>

 

What I think the author was talking about was snow and it was outside for the berries that matter and the snow started to melt.

<START>

 

He ended the story with this sentence because it said she had learned a lesson for life. all the way back home where she is from she missed her friends and seeing her mother training in the garden during that cold time of year. I guess he's poor in a way. In conclusion, choose this sentence because it looks like she learned a life lesson and even start all over again but with a better understanding in her learning.   

<START>

 

Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her so she will retake the test after the winter.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it's more willpower because she loves hibiscus and what other way to end the story she compares to hibiscus because when she says " in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again. She says that now this snow is slowing the hibiscus. So failure is slowing her down. So she will read to prepare for it. arrival of spring when the hibiscus will bud then it will also bud when passing its test.     

<START>

 

  In the article, the author concludes the story with Saeng swearing to himself that "in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is up for auction, then I will take this test again" because the spring and the hibiscus reminds him of home. For example, in the article, she is shaking because she can't tell at home because she misses it too much. So she finds things that remind her of a plant called dok faeng-noi. It's not the real plant but she gets it to remind him where it came from. In conclusion, Saeng finds a plant she loves rust because it reminds her of her home. How about what reminds you of home. Think about it.      

<START>

 

The reason the author chose to end this story with this paragraph is to tell the reader that things get better over time. Saeng failed the driving test because she was not ready. The flower bloomed before it was ready. Author Says You Must Be Patient And Good Things Will Come To You   

<START>

 

The author chose to end the paragraph with the phrase "when they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again". because it shows how the strength of the hibiscus relates to the strength of Saeng. In the story, after failing his driving test, Saeng @ CAPS1 feels good in a hibiscus native to his country. when she comes home, her mother says, “I saw this genus blooming along the lake. Her flowers aren't quite as pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the cold months here. “It shows that saeng is faltering in its new foreign country. The final quote sums up this strength of saeng @ CAPS1 in the strength of flowers… I almost think that if the flower can survive in a country far from home, why not me ? ”      

<START>

 

When she is ready and well, she says she will take the test again. When she is ready and good and the weather is nice, she will have the confidence to take the test again. The author was trying to tell us how she felt about letting her mother down.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it is important for the story. In addition, it closes the story. It is exploding that the girl begins to adjust to the new area and that she will try harder to get along there. So saying she's going to take the test again. It means she's going to look at it in a new way. The author put that at the end trying to make sense of everything and show that the girl has changed.     

<START>

 

In the short story "Winter Hibiscus" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he thought Saeng would be ready to take the test at that point.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she still has hope. The hibiscus gives him hope and strength. In the spring, she will retake her exam and hopes to pass it. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

In the last paragraph of minfong Ho's "Winter Hibiscus" The author concludes by saying "When they come back, Saeng swore to himself in silence, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again ". I think the author concludes with this quote because it shows his determination to overcome this obstacle. For Saeng, hibiscus represents comfort and the ability to overcome. Saeng is very strong and she believes in the determination that comes from her past. The author concluded with this because it shows Saeng's determination.     

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho, the author ends the story in this paragraph to show how important this flower is to Saeng. The text read: “@ CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dug a hole and carefully lowered the“ winter hibiscus. ” This shows the reader that it is very important for Saeng to have this plant in his garden. . Moreover, by having this statement of conclusion, it helps the reader understand the affection of his new country. in addition, the concluding paragraph shows comfort in a moment of disappointment. in the story, it is said: “Her flowers aren't quite as pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. It also shows Saeng's connection to the flower and how it helps her get through everything.     

<START>

 

I think she added this because she needs time to grow like the plant before taking the test again. Sometimes you need more time to pass your test. going to school teaches more than things we need to know, it helps us grow and understand life. I know myself as a tenth grader and understand life better than in grade one. She still has a lot of mental development about her past and present.    

<START>

 

I believe that the author ended the story with this line to show that the hope for the girl was still there and that even perhaps the flower had inspired her a lot. I believe when she says "when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again", she chose precisely this time to start again, and try again. like everything else mentioned. When he says "and this hibiscus is budding" it shows that the flower is blooming again, having a fresh start and starting over again as it would try to do when it again tries to pass the test it has to pass. also the tone of what said it showed hope, she was hopeful and determined that next time she would definitely pass.   

<START>

In the answer that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, it is because this story was about a plant that was growing back every year at around the same time. The paragraph lies like I think when the plant came back in the spring and the geese would come back around it would be another test of growth and not to let the plant die

From the story " Winter Hibiscus " by Minfong Ho, the author concludes this story with the paragraph of what Saeng silently promised because it is to show Saeng's determination. The hibiscus was the plant she found, which looked a lot like the "house" plant, to symbolize her conformation. The hibiscus symbolized his determination in life. "Through the silent season-to-season rehearsal, which is almost familiar to her now," you can conclude that Saeng is thinking about how she recognized the geese. It gives her more self-confidence. From there, "like the geese, she lifted her head and watched their distinctive v be etched," which is why there is still hope in her. This paragraph conclusion that the author had concluded connects what Saeng hopes and believes in now. .       

<START>

 

Saeng swears it to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows it will be difficult and will take time, but in the end she will get approval and happiness. We can see that it is already hard for her by the way she collapses while crying. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things will work out if she is not too stuck in the past.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the paragraph with a statement Saeng said. It was a very good statement. The author ended with this to show that she is motivated and determined to do so. She shows that she is motivated in many ways. she said, "Here, let me help you mum." It shows that she is motivated in helping her mom to finish what she started. She is also determined, saying, "almost reluctantly, she realizes that a lot of things that she once considered strange had become, thanks to a quiet season-to-season repetition, almost familiar now." It shows that she wants to do something and that she doesn't think it's weird anymore. This is why the author concludes this statement.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this When they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is building then I will take this test again! because he is the one who wrote the story. One information is that his family moved from Vietnam to @ ORGANIZATION1 united. The second is that the author could have done this story, it was about him. Saeng fails his driving test.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the "Winter Hibiscus" with this paragraph to show that the narrator realizes that even though she is in a new country, some things are still the same. She therefore becomes determined to pass the test. For example, the narrator said, "She realized that a lot of the things she had thought about were weird before had become, thanks to the rapid season-to-season repetition now familiar to her." This quote shows that the narrator realized that although some aspects of life have changed, some things remain the same. It also shows that some things like the test were strange to her, but now that she knows it, she might pass it. The narrator also said, "Saeng did not dare to look his mother in the eye." This quote shows that the narrator was disappointed with herself for not having passed the test. This means that the test was very important to her with the pressure to pass, and that a new one is ready to take the test. But she will be better prepared. The theme of this story could see things overwhelming you. The narrator has gone through a lot recently but over the seasons.              

<START>

 

The author shows a willingness to try harder in this story. She says, "In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again." " I think the author realizes she will have to adapt. Plus, saying she'll wait for spring means she'll try again and not give up. The author has sentimental value for. Since she is waiting for the hibiscus to sprout, I think she is referring this hibiscus to her country. Since she left her country, the hibiscus is the cupboard she has for her, and therefore, she will wait with the flower      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is now thinking about images associated with memories of her new home, as well as images that she remembers from Vietnam. At the beginning of the story, in the flower shop, she remembers her grandmother, as well as a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other things that remind her of certain feelings and experiences. At the end of the story, she uses both the hibiscus, which reminds her of her old home, and the Canada geese, which no longer seem so unknown to her, to represent the passage of time. She now sees her new home as containing familiar things attached to memories, like her old love did.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph. In the same way. One of the reasons the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because in the story she sad about something that she really wanted. So she took it home and showed it to her mom, then her mom looks at her weird, because in the story it says “ you what ? Her mother looked at her in disbelief. So she explains that she failed the driving test, but that she did not give up. So at the end of the story she said she would take that test again.

The story goes, “When they come back Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes with this to show determination to try again. and pass his driver's license next year. The flowers also reminded him of his home in Vietnam. (for example, " plants that she hadn't even realized she knew but had forgotten brought her back to the world of childhood. ") and the following year, when the flowers turned flowery, she would again be more determined and ready for the test. Also, the blooming of the flowers feels like the start of a new life and maybe the same could be said for Saeng if he passed his driving test. This is why the author ends with this statement.      

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because he says I'll never give up. She is determined at all costs. I think she says she will take the test over and over again until she passes. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because you should never give up.

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the author ends the story by saying "When they return, Saeng silently swore to himself in the spring, when the snow will melt and the geese will return and this hibiscus will bud, so I'll take that test again, ”The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph says, it doesn't matter what Saeng failed the driving test the first time around she doesn't give up until she succeed and drive. ” The author also concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph says that Saeng can wait until the end of winter to see the hibiscus bloom.

In the story " Winter Hibiscus ", the author concludes so as to relate to the beginning of the conflict of the main character, failing his driving test. The author does this to bring the reader back and help the reader predict what will happen in the future, "in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I will retake the test. " @ CAPS1 with this sentence informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those in his native country, it will help him move on. When the hibiscus gets a fresh start by budding in the spring, Saeng will do the same by taking his driving test again. What happened with the driving test, what was it for? ".    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform about the significance of his hole. For example, when she came back, she felt good because she came back to her place. One of the reasons is that she "dedicated herself silently, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding." @ CAPS1 meant coming back was probably the best thing she could do.   

<START>

 

well it seems to me that the reason the author wrote this as his ending is basically because he is sarcastic and emphasizes what he is saying and makes it clear that he was wrong take the test again, and basically if somebody had to kill him to get him to take the test again.

<START>

 

The reason I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph is that she wants to test the hibiscus again when she returns. As proof, in the last paragraph, it is said: " When they return, Saeng silently devoted himself to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." " That's why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.       

<START>

 

The author puts this as a conclusion because it is like a cycle. And he did not finish it with the end of the cycle because leaving readers with this curiosity gives suspense. It was a well-written story and conclusion.

In Minfong Ho's short story " Winter Hibiscus ", a teenage girl fails a driving test but swears to take it again in the spring. The story ended like this to show that the girl will have a fresh start. For example, "When they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again" (HO). The hibiscus is what makes it feel like it is linked to its homeland. So, if the hibiscus is budding, it means that it is starting a new beginning, she feels that she will be able to do the same. This is why the story ends like this.                      

<START>

 

These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in a serious and direct tone and ends with a quote or riddle. Forces the reader to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he ended with what happened so he just added something that got you thinking a bit more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with "when they come back saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and his hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again". because it was different.       

<START>

 

Because she will train and improve in driving and when the flower blooms she will pass the test again. And she will try harder next time. 

<START>

 

The author included this paragraph from seterel because he wanted you to be able to visualize it in your head rather than not seeing the image. If you see a mental picture then it is good for visualization. 

<START>

 

The author concludes with this because she means that she will try to go through an entire season without thinking about the house since she failed in the winter, she will try again in the spring. Oho, you can tell when you see her talking about how the plant reminds her of what life was like before they moved to town. For example, when she smelled the plant, it almost seemed to take her back in time when she was little and they grew in the wild and they were pretty.

The Winter Hibiscus Story by @ CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with "When they return Saeng silently swore to each other in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will pass by again this is ". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Plus, it's not just an ending where you never know what's going on, it gives you something to pass on. Also when the geese come back it is hot and the hibiscus is blooming, so Saeng will be more comfortable as she got used to the idea of living in a new place and met more people. Meanwhile, having the hibiscus in bloom will bring back fond memories of her childhood and life in her homeland. help Saeng reach his goal of passing his test. Also, I think the author ended the story with this passage because it makes people want to reread it or recommend the story to someone else. I know I hate reading stories that end and do n't tell you what happens next. However, the author solved this problem by informing the reader that Saeng wants to pass the test and that he will go back and try again.

The last paragraph of " Winter Hibiscus " reads : " When they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again. . " The author concludes with this statement to inform the reader that Saeng is hope and continue to adapt to its new facility in LOCATION2 @ @ CAPS1 history. Saeng realizes that she is not as far from home in Vietnam as she thinks she is. In florist shops, she sees " plants that she didn't even realize she knew but had forgotten have brought her back to the value of her childhood." “The plants she grew up with also exist in @ LOCATION2. She fails "the test" by buying a winter hibiscus after homesick cry. At the end of the story, she admits that she is getting more and more used to her new life, which is "almost familiar now" to her, like geese flying overhead. The wording in the last paragraph means that in the spring she hopes to be homesick and think of @ LOCATION2 with her geese and winter hibiscus as her home.             

<START>

 

The author ends the story this way to show Saeng's new resolve. The whole story is about Saeng's trip one afternoon to be accepted into his new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with Saeng's determination to pass his driving test and make his life work at @ LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel right at home. "the crisp bitter melon and hibiscus. These @ CAPS1 make Saeng feel more at ease and it should end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay at @ LOCATION1. @ PERSON1 is also inspired by the 'hibiscus that's “strong enough to get through the cold months, that's what matters.” This is a testament to Saeng's determination to get through his new life. And finally, the Saeng geese acknowledge that life at @ LOCATION1 is becoming “familiar” . " These geese bring @ PERSON1 to realize that this is her new home and she can not go back. the whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead to the determination of @ CAPS2, so it is appropriate to end the story with determination.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new beginning is beginning For example the fact that they have moved to another country. This is what the author means when spring arrives. Spring represents new life, that's what Saeng and his mother do. In addition, the snow represents a white from the past / hard times. Finally, when the hibiscus begins to bud, it also means a fresh start. So if you put it all together the hard times go away when the snow melts and then a fresh start when spring begins and the flower buds That's why the author put this paragraph into the story because they had need a fresh start.          

<START>

 

The author had concluded that this sentence was the closing sentence, as Saeng believes that she deserves another chance to take the garden test because she failed the test before her mother was disappointed with her. And what Saeng says at the end of the story is that she'll have more confidence to take the Garden Test again.   

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it is the end of winter.  

<START>

 

The author probably ends the story like this because it creates a sense of hope and wonder. I think the story is mostly about things to come. For example, Saeng took a driving test and failed. She also seemed a little overwhelmed by the idea of "home". Saeng obviously cares about failing the test, otherwise she wouldn't have taken the time to think about it, which led her to a greenhouse. In the greenhouse, she was looking for a specific plant to buy that reminded her of her home. Thinking about the house and her grandmother upsets her. Saeng almost has this internal war with herself and the author ends the story this way to end the story giving the reader a sense of hope for Saeng and wonder.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed to get a certain plant because she died but the winter is over in the spring, this is where she has the chance to get this flower. For example, in the story it is said that Saeng collapsed and cried. It was already dark when Saeng returned home. It is not his fault because in the story it is said that the wind was blowing harder, tearing up the last remarks of green weeds and chicory. The conclusion because it will be the next time you see Saeng again with a beautiful plant in his hand.    

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph @ CAPS1 the sump Saeng wants to finish or @ CAPS2 Take the test again when they come back and also the author is @ CAPS3 people @ CAPS4 don't give up what you are doing with you - even then she says that "when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again", she means that she will not give up at all.

<START>

 

The author ended the story with this sentence because in the spring, Saeng will take the test again and his hibiscus will finally bud. Saeng is going to retake the test because she failed the @ CAPS1 time she took. This is why the author put this sentence at the end of the story.  

<START>

 

The author wrote this paragraph at the end of the story to symbolize a new beginning. I think this because when it's spring and the hibiscus is budding, it will remind her of her homeland and she will have a fresh start in the test. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has promised to retake the test in the spring and will have more confidence when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus begins to bud. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eye has now swept through it. “ Saeng feels lonely because she comes from a different country and misses everything she knew and loved. Now she has the hibiscus to remind her of home.    

<START>

 

The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was a reflection and a process where she was learning and growing. At first SaenG is very uncomfortable and disappointed with herself. “ I failed the test ,” Saeng said. “For a long time, Ms. Pan Ouvong didn't say anything. You can tell the mom at first disappointed, and then as they talk they crash, which relieves the mood. " How would you like an omelet with slices of bitter melon ?" " I would love it, " Saeng said. Her mood has now lightened and she makes a calm, collective decision to try again, which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good state of mind rather than upset and distraught.               

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", it has an unusual ending. There are several reasons why the author decided to end the story this way. First of all, the girl failed the test that got him into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of will to survive, and it shows that she is trying to 'achieve her goal until she gets it. Finally, the end could represent a new beginning as when the snow melts and changes winter into spring. That's what the ending of “Winter Hibiscus” means and that's why the author concluded it this way.    

<START>

 

The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng will try to adapt to his new home. He lets you know that Saeng is no longer going to cry and be sad, but she will adjust and go on with her life. The author adds this: "I mean, not like the kind we had at-to-". but adding the last statement in the story, it shows that Saeng has decided to move on with his life and not be sad anymore. She set herself the goal of accepting it. This is the reason why the author concluded this story the way he does.  

<START>

 

The author ended the story with this paragraph because he was trying to tell us that the hibiscus represents comfort in a time of disappointment for Saeng. She saw the factory when she had just passed her driver's license.

Authors use conclusions to conclude a story or to get the reader thinking. In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the author uses the conclusion "when they come back, Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will come back. the test "he uses this conclusion to show that she will adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden store, she collapses crying, it says "and in the hot and humid shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and left". because she didn't pass her test, she doesn't think she will. So she motivates herself at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used this paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so that she can fit into this new world.     

<START>

 

Why the author concludes it because the author wants to show her that she will not give up. that she'll retake the test and try harder the next time to overcome her challenge, and not give up. The author wants to show her that she is not a coward and that she is full of determination even if she has conflicts.  

<START>

 

Why did the author end the story with this paragraph? I believe the author has concluded this paragraph because he says what she is going to do in the future. For example, in the story she told her mother “ I failed… ” When she put the flower in the hole near the garden, a flock of geese flew south.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said "Then I'll take this back", it means she knows she has another chance. This shows that she has a strong will and that she won't give up easily. So what she says in the last paragraph is if you don't get it the first time try and try again. In the story it is said "she realized that a lot of things that she once considered strange had become, thanks to the silent repetition from season to season". In this part, I can say that it is already starting to change. So I think next time she will do very well.      

<START>

 

I think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it shows his determination to pass the test. The test was to be able to grow the garden. You know that because it says "in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again". flowers and trying to grow something. In this story, they mention that she helps her mother in the garden. So I think when the plants didn't grow, she wanted to try again. That's why I think they chose to end with the statement to retake the test in the spring.  

<START>

 

The author uses this paragraph because it recalls memories of when Saeng set the ground during "winter hibiscus" and a herd of Canada geese flew close to her. When Saeng failed her test the first time, she didn't dare look at her mother. She depended on the hibiscus helping her or wanting to retake the test but not before they sprouted again.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to conclude all the things they talked about in the story. In the story, they talk about spring and now Saeng and his mother are planting flowers and everything. 

<START>

 

I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show that she won't give up if they don't. I think this is because birds and hibiscus will only reap if they survive. This means that they will stay strong in the meantime, just like her. She will survive her new environment and change to adapt to @ CAPS1's lifestyles.   

<START>

 

 I think the author concludes the story the way he did because it will make people want to read the next story to see if the test is passed, it adds suspense to the story

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it represents saeng's decision to try again and overcome the obstacles in his way. It is used instead of saying "I will try again next spring" to show her diction and to show her purpose or decision in a different way, for example, He says ", Almost reluctantly, she turned herself. realized that a lot of the things she had thought as strange as before had become, through the silent repetition of season upon season almost familiar now. At first, the geese flying in the sky were new to her, but now she is used to it. Perhaps the author is referring to geese as they will be familiar (the driving test) and will pass as she has become accustomed to and familiarized with. geese. Ever since her family arrived at @ LOCATION1 from Vietnam, she has been adjusting to changes in her life and circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph simply says that she will retake the test at next spring, but the author has put this paragraph he there to show the diction with an emphasis on geese, representing learning something new, and hibiscus, something familiar. This emphasizes the point of the story, which is not to give up and the will to survive.       

<START>

 

The author loves plants @ CAPS1, so after each winter she starts @ CAPS2 to see if she can plant and grow some nice plants. Spring @ ORGANIZATION1 is the only @ ORGANIZATION1 where you can grow unique plants like it does. His test is to cultivate a garden of beautiful plants and vegetables. The author will work hard, just like his mother, to bring the gardens to life, especially after winter.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He spoke for the last part ho belle was nutura. He also thought that Saeng liked nutura very much, she would go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the garden to take care of the plant. That's why I think the author decides to end with this paragraph, he would probably describe how much he loves nature.   

<START>

 

In Minfong Ho's "Winter Hibiscus", the author ended the story with this particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story tells of the failure and shame Saeng felt when she failed her driving test, and how the discovery of a familiar hibiscus plant gave her new life. By purchasing the hibiscus, Saeng remembered her home and giving this unique hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to flourish, as it once was. She was able to establish a link with the plant. Spring symbolizes the start of a new year and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life. Saeng therefore wants to start his life again when the plant starts again and takes his driving test again.    

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the symbolism of this paragraph says that when everything is back to normal and "the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I will take this test again." which means she will be ready to relocate again and try to adjust. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph on retaking the test to show that Saeng is getting used to @ LOCATION2 more and more, our memories last forever, and even the smallest of things can hold memories for us. The paragraph shows that Saeng is getting more used to @ LOCATION2 by showing us that she will not give up @ LOCATION2 and will continue to work to understand our customs. The last paragraph also shows that our memories last forever with the hibiscus representing Vietnam and his home there. It also shows that she can start a new one here, just like the hibiscus does at home. Finally, the paragraph shows that even the smallest of things can retain our memories by the hibiscus representing its home in Vietnam. The hibiscus brings back many memories to Saeng and helps him cope with @ LOCATION2. This is how the last paragraph shows us that Saeng gets used to @ LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and the smallest things can hold memories.

In the story “ Winter Hibiscus ” by @ PERSON1, a teenage girl ; Saeng and his family left Vietnam for the United States. Saeng walks home after failing her driving test, and she passes a familiar factory. She then goes to a florist to buy the plant. She arrives home and tells her mom that she failed the test of course her mom is upset, but she cooks dinner and the "winter hibiscus" plant at the end of the story, turns up. Saeng said, "When they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again. and her mother is not too mad at her. She feels that everything is fine. be fine and she can take the test again in the spring, when life blossoms.

The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese were inspired by the flower to come back, try again and not give up. For example, Saeng swore to himself that in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I will take this test again. This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for his determination. and that she would come back, like them. that's why the author decided to end the story with this line because she wanted to show Saeng that she was inspired and that she wasn't giving up.     

<START>

 

In Minfong Ho's short story “Winter Hibiscus”, I think the author ends with this paragraph because it shows that she is determined to succeed. "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts, and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, then I'll take the test again." This shows that it is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year. She will come back just like the geese and the hibiscus. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she wasn't determined, she might never come through and fit in with her new society.     

<START>

 

I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcomes obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for the future. At the beginning of the story, saeng is upset that she failed her driving test, and then on top of that, she is upset to see the plants native to her homeland. "In the story it says," When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out her hand and gently touched a petal. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub. This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses a lot and is very important to her. By bringing this plant home, it is as if it brought back a little piece of its homeland. This quote : - " when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." Shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @ LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.           

<START>

 

The author thus concludes the story because she is not ready to continue her life. When everything is back, she will pass this test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she won't worry about school. For example, she wrote: “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she once considered strange before had become, thanks to the silent season-to-season repetition, almost familiar now. like geese. This means that she has been used to change and has accepted the situation.     

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the snow doesn't melt in the spring, the geese don't come back in the winter, and the hibiscus doesn't bud until spring either. Hibiscus is a beautiful plant Saeng loved this plant.    

<START>

 

The whole story of Saeng's purchase of hibiscus is a response to his failure to obtain a driver's license. It crushed her. She wants to remember her old homeland where she did not read the driving lessons to the end. So she goes to a greenhouse to find plants similar to those she had in her native country. She does this to try and feel better, but "in the hot and humid shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng collapsed and cried." Saeng feels that she has failed and the hibiscus gives her hope and memories of her old country. Her mom clearly sees and understands this when she isn't yelling at Saeng for spending @ NUM1 $ on the plant. "I'm glad you have it," Saeng's mother says because she knows it comforts her daughter. Together the hibiscus plant. By doing this, they plant Saeng's hope of growing up, not only to pass the driving test, but also to be successful in the new country. * The story ends with these lines because Saeng decides if the hibiscus will grow then too. She will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she has adjusted. * The hibiscus, although it is not the one she had in the old country, she knows that they can adapt to their environment and therefore the plant has in the new country. The plant will grow if it can adapt. Saeng can grow up if she adapts to this new country.              

<START>

 

The author tries to communicate that Saeng will never give up and her confidence will increase so that she can retake her test like hibiscus in the spring. Comparing Saeng to the hibiscus plant in the last paragraph was to show how she will grow and move forward to retake the test at the right time. The snowmelt represents her grief that goes away as the sun shows how she will succeed and grow like the hibiscus she bought. The plant growing in the sun would represent her confidence to pass the test next time, shedding cold, sharp snow that is like her negative self-esteem and attitude. The author chose to compare Saeng to the plant in the last paragraph to show how this relates to his life and attitude, and how his life would change due to the hibiscus plant.    

<START>

She will take the test again because she thinks she is confident to take it the next time.

The author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because it wants to show the courage of the girl to immigrate to @ LOCATION1. After failing his driving test, Saeng felt he had gone deaf and worthless. Her mother took it into consideration and didn't get mad at her for buying the flower. In fact, she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that eventually everything would work out. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this, she became overwhelmed with determination and took charge of planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face challenges on a daily basis. Saeng's mother was in the cold plantation and was trying to make the most of her situation. By giving this example, Saeng realized that she too could make the most of her situation. This is why Saeng ultimately decides to retake his driving test and ultimately live with the same attitude as his mother.

Failure of her driving test, really upset Saeng, so by waiting another year she can train more and become better, so that when she comes back and retest, she will be an even better driver, having the time to practice, and start over. It's almost like a new start for Saeng, another year has passed and a new one when his familiar plant is budding and starting to start over, too.

She ends with this paragraph because it starts over. When the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding, it's like a reboot and she can try again, dealing with her memories of home and her adjustment to the new country. I think she can handle it better and take it back, it shows that she won't give up.  

<START>

 

She said this because she had failed to keep the tropical plant alive. She was disappointed in herself and that's why she said. In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, so I take that your new t. When she failed and her mom said she'll be okay, you can always try again.

I believe the reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it tells the reader and herself. From my perspective, she is once again working in the garden to see if it catches her interest. I believe the author is trying to express this because at the beginning of the story the author shows no interest in the garden or in the world around him. For example, when she was supposed to buy only seeds for the garden, she went to use some of her mother's money to buy herself a big pimp. So in conclusion, I think what I've written makes it clear what the author feels and why she ended her story the way she did.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with "When they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the show melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." because Saeng failed the test before and now she wants to take the test. She learned a lot from her mother that day which completely changed her attitude towards life.

<START>

 

The author could have concluded the story with this sentence to show that she still cares about the test and not especially about a mixed-race plant that is going to die anyway. Also because she must pass the test and the author does everything in her power to ensure that the girl succeeds in the end and does not have to repeat the test. but also he / she says this because he / she wants us to know that it is not only about other things that are dear in life but that school is really more important than anything deep down.

The reason the author, Minfong Ho, ended the story "Winter Hibiscus" with the last paragraph was due to the story of the girl who took a test. And on this test which I don't know what the test is, she failed and comes back with a saebba hedge. It is a tame plant for the family. The family loves this plant. They are what I understand from history, newcomers to a country. And the country is @ LOCATION1. They moved here from Vietnam. She is going to take her driving license and come home unsuccessful. One of the things her mother asks, "Why are you spending so much money on this beautiful plant when you could have the famous bee-maags" which is the mother's attempt to tell a Big Mac who their sandwich is. favorite fast food. But the reason the girl returns with the factory is because she failed her parents' driving test. She wants to go back and try again. " Then the snow will melt and the geese will come back and this hibiscus will be budding, so I'll come back to take the test again." " She believes that the next time she goes, she pass the test and it will be no shame and it will make his parents proud by passing the test because it is a great honor for the family, I believe what I get from it. In Vietnam not many people drive and want their daughter to earn this and it is something they don't have.

It's clear that Saeng is struggling through a period of homesickness after recently leaving Vietnam. But over time, she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and her homeland. As Saeng progresses through the story, it is evident that she yearns for memories of her homeland, but begins to find new things to enjoy in her new home. For example, while she is touched by the memories evoked by the hibiscus flower, she is intrigued by new experiences, like eating Big @ CAPS1 and making new friends. While homesickness has caused her to struggle, she knows that over time, she will be able to overcome the obstacle of leaving the old ways for the new ones without erasing them completely either. She is confident that by the spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the confidence to pursue whatever arises in her future.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the vowel Saeng to show a sense of change in Saeng. Winter is very brutal, as Saeng's mother said, but spring is when things come to life. I think this shows the meaning of Saeng. Although the winter is harsh and @ MONTH1 blows them by the wind. When spring comes, it will retry the test and come back to life and enjoy @ LOCATION1 even if it is far from the rain. The author has done well to conclude the story with this vowel.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he tries to say that whenever something leaves their house, they always come back. The hibiscus reminds her of home and that's where she wants to go. Saeng had failed her driving test and she said when the geese come back I will do it again. The plant reminds him of his home but it's "Not like the third one we had before" (Ho). She tries to say the ones in Vietnam are better and she wants to go back because she misses it.

The daughter, Saeng, seems to be attached to nature and enjoy it when spring arrives as she said, a natural and natural new start and she will be motivated to pass the test that she failed again. The author has most likely finished with this paragraph to show that there will be hope for Saeng and that she will do what she needs to do to be comfortably settled in her new home country. The whole story goes that she is still not happy with her new home, but that it would be cut off and she would be left with new chances and a new life, which they did by using spring to show it.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to perhaps show that by then she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved I didn't like it because I didn't have a lot of friends, but after a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friends. 'friends. It's like Saeng because she misses her old house because she keeps talking about it and then crying for example, when I saw the plant it was the one she had in her old house and she started to cry because she had missed it. In conclusion, that's why he put this at the end of the story.

I believe the author chose to end with this paragraph because the paragraph represents new beginnings and starting over. When Saeng fails her driving test, she has a moment of weakness, she feels lonely, then she sees a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam. Since then, the plant comforts her. "These flowers are not quite as pretty, but they are strong enough to get through the cold months here" In this quote, Saeng's mother tells her that the flower is also, out of place, but yet she has found the courage and determination. to keep pushing. In the last paragraph, Saeng decides that, like the flower and the birds, she can also find a way to cope with fears. She decides to take the tests again.

During "Winter Hibiscus" written by Minfong Ho, a young girl and her mother at one place, and Saeng's daughter is having a hard time.Saeng found a plant called dok faeng-noi that reminds her of home. So she bought it and brought it home to show it to her mother. At first her mother was upset, she bought a plant for @ NUM1 dollar but then, hearing her daughter being disappointed with herself, she found joy in the beautiful plant, while Saeng's mother was cooking. dinner .Saeng planted the beautiful plant and thought to himself when the geese come back, the hibiscus is budding and in its spring it will pass the test again. She found the strength in herself and the courage to do better. I think the author wanted to show how she respected herself at the end of the passage. This is why the author finished it as she did.

It really upset Saeng that he failed the driving test. Not only that, but she had to move to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made matters worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of Vietnam. The way the memories come back to her when she saw these flowers shows how she felt. It was about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, "… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again", it shows her starting over again and going through the hard times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the trials she will overcome.

The hibiscus helped her through some disappointing times. The geese also reminded us that some things in the house were the same.

In @ CAPS1 Ho's “ winter hibiscus ” story, the story ends with Saeng promising himself that she will retake the test in the spring. The author most likely ends this way because it shows how Saeng overcomes his Spring Sadness Test when the Hibiscus is at @ LOCATION1. This is shown when Saeng says “I failed the test (@ NUM1) it shows @ CAPS2 leaving her homeland and makes her even sadder, but then she promises herself that in the spring when @ LOCATION1 blooms, she will try again. She does this when she says to herself "... in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again."

The author concludes the story with "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts when the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adapt to the change without forgetting where she came from. This is shown using geese and hibiscus symbols together. The geese represent the new home and the sounds Saeng had to adapt to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of its past and its homeland. The assembly of the symbols shows that she has come to accept both places. By @ CAPS1 that she will take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents what she feels about @ LOCATION1 and by passing the test, she allows herself to succeed with @ LOCATION1 and to adapt to the change in his life.

 The author concludes the story with the sentence, `` When they return, Saeng silently swore to herself in the spring, when the snows will melt and the geese will return and this hibiscus will bud, then I will take this test again.

We know that this special plant will help Saeng in the future proplems . e, and failing his finish test. Saeng struggled to overcome these and other events. so I think that sentence was put at the end so that readers could see that everything would be fine, and overcome all that has happened knowing that we know that This special plant will help Saeng to solve future problems.

After reading the story "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho, I believe the quote, "When they come back, Saeng swore in silence, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and the hibiscus the budding, then I'll take this test again. Has been made into history for a reason. I believe this quote concluded the story because it is ashamed of a tone and a sense of hope. For example, in the story, it says, “Saeng dug a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it.” This shows that this plant spreads a lot here. The story tells on reading that things lack memories of his grandmother. This represents hope for Saeng as it always reminds her of happy memories that she once had that prompts her here to try to overcome the losses. Therefore, the quote concludes the story because it speaks of Saeng for hope and peace. This means that when the plant blooms in the spring, it will have a new sense of hope and happiness.

She crashes it when she gets home and swears to take a driving test again. When the geese come back. The plant is like an encouragement to her.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting used to things repeating themselves in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happened again she would do the same. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.

I think athor includes that because. she failed and needs more study time to get the @ NUM1 thing so other than this fucking new

The author uses this sentence to conclude the story to show that Saeng's hope is restored. Throughout the story, Saeng is sad and misses his home. She feels hopeless in this new land, the hibiscus reminds her of home and brings back memories of being home with her grandmother which makes her want to be back home. The author adds the part on the departure of the geese because they also have to leave their homes. The hibiscus symbolizes her strength and the fact that she will succeed in moving to a foreign land.    

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng won't give up and will keep trying. In the story, all the memories of her old country encourage her to be strong. For example, the flower made her sad but in the end it made her better. At first, too, she didn't really like the new changes and missed home, but in the end some of the same memories she had at home were in her new country. These are the reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph    

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho, I think the author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough strength to come back and flourish, it has enough. force to come back and repeat the test. . For example, in the story it says " but it's strong enough to get through the cold months ". This quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong. And Saeng sees that, as if the plant is strong enough to come back after a cold winter, it can return to the test after failing. Overall I think Saeng and Hibiscus plants are very strong.      

<START>

 

In this story, it is about the similarity between Saeng and the hibiscus plant when it comes to adapting to their environment and how she and the plant will continue as Saeng with her “ test ”. But I know because he says " Then I'll take this test again, " she says she says she's going to thrive again, just like the hibiscus plant. So in conclusion, she is very similar to the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and will adapt to changes as well, just like hibiscus.

In the story, Saeng went for the pants that reminded him of his grandmother. She found the plant and then she thought of her grandmother and she cried.

He wants to learn the spirits of hibiscus. Don't be afraid of the price. You just stay one step ahead, keep learning what you want, then you will be successful. like the hibiscus has strong life: struggle with the environment.

When they return, Saeng silently dedicates himself, in the spring the hibiscus is budding. she will pass the test. I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to test them again.  

<START>

 

The author ended this story like that because that's how she started the story. The little girl was looking at the flowers and plants at the beginning, so the author thought it would be a good thing to end the story as if it had started. Also because Saeng's friendship with plants and flowers will return in the spring when everything blooms and is very beautiful. This shows that the plants give her a sense of comfort when she is going through difficult times. This is why the author concludes with Saeng and the plants.  

<START>

 

In @ CAPS1 Ho's "Winter Hibiscus", the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author is trying to get a message across to saeng. When saeng saw the geese " slowly moving away, " she thought to herself. “ When they come back, ” Saeng will also come back to school. “ The geese are coming back and this hibiscus is budding ” means that saeng will go back to school and be a new person. " This hibiscus is budding " indicates that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take this test again "because it is a new beginning for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. Since the flowers will grow and have a new life, so go saeng.

Saeng has sworn to himself that when the hibiscus begins to bud again, she will retest the test. The hibiscus symbolizes the hope that things can work out on a second try. She concludes the story with a wish because it expresses her last hope. For example, the hibiscus comforted her in a new country, with a new environment, but it also explains how she feels. She swears to show that she won't give up despite her first fall. For example, "Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral" (Ho). This quote explains what the plant meant to her. That's why she ended the story with a wish.

The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows that the girl is ready to overcome obstacles and although she @ MONTH1 failed once she keeps trying, it also shows a connection between geese and the hibiscus and the girl who wants to overcome obstacles. Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at some point. 

<START>

 

In the last paragraph when she said she was going to do the test again, but in the spring when all the snow is melting and the hibiscus is budding. She says this because it's her favorite time of year. She will therefore feel more confident this time. For example, when she talks about the manigascar hibiscus that grows through bricks, she loves hibiscus. So she wants to take the test when she feels best.

I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph to let readers know that Saeng is a survivor just like the hibiscus. Saeng hasn't quite adapted to America and thinks this plant reminds him of his home 

<START>

 

The author ends it like this because spring is a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test, she wants to start over in the spring like the flowers do. Namely that the hibiscus will grow back while it is dying. For the coming spring is the time to start a new one, where babies are born, flowers bloom and a new beginning is formed.   

<START>

 

The concludes the sentence this way because they are trying to show that Saeng is a very determined girl and no matter how many times she fails she always tries over and over to say that she is right. By doing this, the author shows what Saeng believes in and no matter how small or how difficult the channel is, she will continue to say that she has finished what she started. Because moving was very hard for her. She had a lot of trouble communicating with people and just got tired of making friends as it's not always easy to be new, moving on she took another look at things as they were different for her. But over time she got the hang of it, so as long as you try you can get it right, that's what the author was trying to say by concluding it as it was.

The author added the last paragraph because Saeng's vow helps the reader Saeng and his pain, but his optimism that things will get better. I translate the wish by saying that when things get back to normal, things will be much better for her in this new country. Spring symbolizes normality because at home where she thinks she is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The melting snow would be the pain that was going away. The return of the geese would symbolize that Saeng knows things will get better as she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolizes happiness, so she will be happier when things improve.

When she consoles herself with her mother, Saeng silently swears something to herself. Saeng swears "When they come back in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that test again." @ CAPS1 Ho chose to end the story this way because the story represents the guest for the adaptation.

She finds her past in plants that remember Vietnam in deep sadness. The narration states “ A were shallower and stronger than it stung Saeng's eye… ” (No) She remembers and misses everything she had, she wanted her country her grandmother and her life . She came home to her mother with a plant and disappointed her mother with the cost but understands the pain. The narration says "it's a beautiful plant, she finally said sad you have it" (No).

In the story "Winter Hibiscus". The author ends the story with "When they return Saeng silently vowed, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again. To show or emphasize that if the hibiscus, a plant that reminds her of her home, may end, and so can she.In the story, after the author failed his driving test and walked home, seeing the flowers reminded her of her home and the city. linked to her past, making her feel less alone. For example, when the author says that a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes has now swept through her. This shows that her house misses her and that the flower gave her a way to connect deeply with her memories, also when she said “like the geese, the distinctive V against the sky.” This shows that the geese were a lot like her, they moving into a different place to start a new one. He fa ire to feel that if they can adapt and change, it will over time. In conclusion, the end was to emphasize more her feelings towards her hometown and the new city in which she lives.

The author thus ends the story by comparing to adapt, change or start all over for example; Geese fly away when it's cold but they always come back to give their house another chance . Another great example is the Hibiscus , it always buds at @ DATE1 but does not die off in winter. He always comes back . Saeng obviously realized this and promised to try his drivers test again because it might work this time around . The author has tried to get the broadcast message, "do not give to the top. "

Determination, help, strength - all are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with the paragraph. First, the determination is a @ CAPS1 why Saeng will come back and retake the test. Saeng failed her driving test the first time around and she wants to wait and start over. She decided to take different steps to pass the test. Second, I believe the help is a @ CAPS1 why the author has concluded with this paragraph. Saeng will need help passing the test and she believes the hibiscus will help her pass and do other things. The author proves that she will go back and that she will be ready. Finally, strength is the last @ CAPS1 why the author chose the paragraph to end the story. Saeng believes the hibiscus will give him the strength to pass the test. The author left the paragraph to show that she will go back and be stranger than before. These are the reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

Mingfong Ho concludes " Winter Hibiscus " with the paragraph : " When they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again. This last paragraph shows that Saeng will not give up his struggle to adapt to this new place. Saeng went through difficult times ; she moved to the United States and failed her driving test. In the greenhouse, Saeng collapses and even cries. The hibiscus flower that saeng bought cost the family a lot of money, but for Saeng it was very important. This flower represented hope. When the flower buds are blooming again, this would be a good time to take his driving test. As Saeng adapts to the United States, the hibiscus adapts to the new garden.

The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng has changed. Saeng did not want to take the test and she had no confidence in herself. In the story, Saeng's mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for @ MONEY1 because it reminded her of his home. Now that Saeng has been comforted, she feels more relaxed and is ready and more confident to take the test again. so Saeng has changed.

The author concludes the story with, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself , in the spring. When the snow melts and the situation of the geese and this hibiscus bud, then I will take this test again. " The author chose this to end the story to show that you have to keep the faith in your heart. Saeng was still a bit homesick throughout the story. This might have had an impact on how well she did her driving test. If one waited a season or two, her homesickness would probably pass away and she could concentrate on reaching her goal. The lack of her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have had a huge impact on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the perpetrator could be that he wanted to lighten the mood a bit. Saeng collapsing in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling, and the fact that she vowed to herself to pass the test when spring came kind of raised your hopes for her.

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the author ends the story with Saeng's thoughts. The idea of trying the test when the hibiscus begins to bud connects the story. The story is mostly about how she searches for a flower and what memories it brings. But she wouldn't have gone to the store if she had passed the test. This creates a full understanding of the test and the hibiscus. It also shows the importance of the hibiscus. Saeng and Flower must adapt to survive and are out of place. Saeng was from Vietnam and the flower came from a store, the two were moved from where they belong to a new location. In some ways, Saeng is the flower. She has to adapt to her home to survive. The flower, outside in the cold, must adapt to its environment in order to survive. When she finds out that the flower survived the harsh winter, she will realize that she can survive by living in @ LOCATION2. It would make her feel strong and focused.

Ever since the family moved to the United States the family has never been happier having dinner together and planting together, they have had time to plant all the time.

If you've ever had to leave your hometown or home country, you know how heartwarming something can be that comes from your old country and the one you know. The fact that Saeng had geese, plants, and all the rest comforted her enough to know that she could take the test next spring. Throughout history, it seemed like everything Saeng had ever seen in her home country Vietnam warmed and comforted her in one way or another. At the beginning of the story, this illustrates her feelings as she makes her way into the greenhouse. Many times in the story you can still " hear " that feeling of love when she calls the plant by its name in her native language. Throughout the story, you could always feel the love and care that she had. The author knows how much she loves these things and that they would encourage her. This is why he concluded the story as such.        

<START>

 

The author concludes this paragraph with the story because of the potential of the hibiscus. Saeng will therefore retake the test, regardless of whether she has already taken it and failed. She's like the hibiscus. The hibiscus appears out of place and is determined to survive the snowmelt. So she will redo the test and us the hibiscus as a modification.

The author concluded the story with the paragraph When They Return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the springtime when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, so I will do this test again because the author wanted the reader will notice how mother and child relate to gardening. Between the different things the author said about Saeng and Saeng's mother. Like in the author, it shows how they bonded being Saeng and Saeng's mother, which I think was pretty neat in the way the author came up with this story. It was a pretty interesting story that left you guessing, on the year-end seat, wondering. But I loved reading this story. I also liked that the daughter and mother were such good friends. But it was a beautiful thing to do with the daughter and mother being so in touch with each other. Also, by doing this, the author showed some of his ways of thinking. The author shows us that he has a great mind and a good way of thinking. This author tells us a beautiful story of a girl and her mother who seemed very good to me. This story is a gardening story of a girl and her mother who leave Vietnam and move to @ ORGANIZATION1 to live the rest of their lives.          

<START>

 

There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Maybe it's because Saeng wants to take the test now to make his mother happy. It might also be because she will need to be able to drive next year for some reason. Maybe it's because it cost him money to keep taking it. She really likes her hibiscus though.    

<START>

 

The author thus concludes the story to show that Saeng is a determined individual. It is symbolic because when the geese come back, she will retake the test because when they left, she had failed. The snowmelt and the budding of the hibiscus show that spring and spring are usually the start of a new beginning. The last paragraph is like a symbol to start from scratch. Saeng was upset that she had failed the test. She said, "I failed the test." Stuttering shows that she was upset. Since she was upset, giving her time until she retakes the test is a good thing. The author ended the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is strong and will make a fresh start.

I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some relief with the flower. It also showed that Saeng wasn't going to give up and would keep trying.

The flower had a deep impact on her because it reminded her of home and when she started to think about her grandmother she got a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and what it is. meant to her, she felt comforted by the flower. I think the conclusion of the story is very positive.

I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to leave us with hope. Saeng will retake the test she failed. Saeng struggles to adjust to his new life, while waiting for the snow to melt, the geese to return and the hibiscus to sprout, Saeng gives himself time to adjust and heal. The paragraph shows Saeng's courage and hope to take the test again.   

<START>

 

Honestly, I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she has insured costs now. Maybe this is a mental test that we all have to face. Perhaps the return of the geese and the budding of the plant are also a metaphorical test.   

<START>

 

The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to convey the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her, it represents her homeland and all that she left behind. This last line represents a lot of things. Melting snow, returning geese and budding hibiscus all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact that Saeng wants to retake his test shows how obstacles can be overcome and goals achieved.

For example, the text says "the geese are coming back and this hibiscus is budding, so I will take the test again". It shows that even though she failed once, she's not going to let that stop her. The girl also expresses a little what she feels for the geese and the plant. For example the text says "when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding". This shows that she does not regret buying the hibiscus.

The author concludes the “Winter Hibiscus” story this way because it creates a sense of hope Saeng feels for the future. Saeng felt very sad when she returned home after failing her driving test. The author describes this scene as "The wind was blowing harder, tearing the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds". The winter and the cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she comes home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says he is " strong enough to get through the cold months here ." It also symbolizes Saeng's achievement. At the end of the story, Saeng sees geese and realizes that "many things that she once considered strange had become, through season after season repetition , almost familiar." It shows that she is really adjusting to her new home and that she has hope for spring, the return of the geese and the flowering of the hibiscus.

The author concluded the story in this paragraph because she wants readers to understand that she hasn't given up on the plant and is determined. For example, the story goes that Saeng said "I failed the test", she felt like she had not accomplished what she wanted. So at the end of the story, she said, "I'll take this test again."

I know from this quote, "one of the flowers had fallen, and Saeng carefully picked it up and smelled it." This quote shows that she cares about the little things in nature. Another quote that shows Saeng cares about nature is : "She tilted the pot and deftly pulled out the ball of soil, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand." This shows that Saeng is very attentive to a small plant, which is part of nature. So in conclusion, the author concluded the story with the above paragraph to show that the Saeng is a caring person towards nature.

Saeng will adjust to her new country in time, but not if she spends her time wishing to return to her native country. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers to start a new one and adjust to society. Saeng will retry his test drive when the plant buds again, thus restarting its life cycle.

For example, on her way home after failing her driving test, Saeng sees a flower and says, “[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost visceral.

Saeng then went to a flower shop and identified all the flowers from his childhood. She realizes that her old home had all of these flowers and Saeng has used this connection to her past to further increase her courage to adjust to her known life. Another example is when in the text it says, "She realized that many things that she thought before were strange have become… almost familiar to her now." Saeng comes to this realization by listening to his mother talk about how the hibiscus flower that normally survived in her old home could survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do that and that she no longer thought things like the fat @ CAPS1 here would be weird. This is how the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has overcome an obstacle in her life and is learning to move on. In the story, Saeng is often stuck on past memories rather than creating new ones. For example, when Saeng goes to the florist to buy the plant, she begins to remember old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled "jasmine", she thinks of her deceased grandmother and remembers how she used to put jasmine flowers in her hair. In addition, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is "not a real one" and she also says that it is "not like the kind we had before". @ CAPS1, she keeps comparing her new life to her old life in her native country and she doesn't allow her new experiences to be as good as her old ones. @ CAPS1 when the author concludes the story with this paragraph it shows growth in the girl, Saeng, and that she is ready to move on and make new memories, like trying to take her exam again driving.

 Tisaeng had failed her driving test after going to " flour is it and bought " a plant that was " dok faeng - noi ", she had fond memories of the factory. She remembered Vietnam and how she was everywhere. all the time. She had bought "@ CAPS1 hibiscus" for comfort. The last paragraph says, "" When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take the test again. Saeng understood that things happen for a reason and that opportunities arise again and again. Much like geese go south and @ CAPS2 as the seasons change.

The author concluded the story with the paragraph " When they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." " To show that the character has become part of his new surroundings. Just like the environment, it is constantly undergoing change, and in the spring when all the things that couldn't be better during the winter have started to flourish, so will it. And when she starts to thrive and feels like herself again, then she will be ready to take the driver's license and be successful. She will have come to herself as the geese come home when she is done crying as the snow has finished melting, and when she is done crying as the snow has finished melting, and when she is ready to s 'open, just as the hibiscus starts budding, it will be ready to take the test.

Throughout the story "Winter Hibiscus", the author conveys the sense of hope and comfort that Saeng gets when she thinks about the past. And to continue that feeling of hope, the last sentence makes Saeng feel better than she was at the start of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng felt alienated, alone and out of place in her new country. But as the story progresses, she begins to develop a peace of mind, and her future will certainly be brighter with the passing away and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to convey a sense of hope for Saeng's future and growing confidence.

The meaning of the last sentence is to see if the winter hibiscus will seed and will throw everything to become a flower for the year and repeat the process.

Minfong Ho concluded “Winter Hibiscus” with this paragraph to show the hope and renewal of Saeng's character. Spring represents birth and renewal, a second chance for Saeng. She had already failed what appears to be an important test (possibly her citizenship test) and motivated her to try and remember her past, which she sorely misses. The winter hibiscus seems to represent itself, and this illustrates it: "This is - it is not a real one," Saeng muttered as she was still too shaky to say the words at home, for fear. that she does not burst into tears again. 'Not like the kind we had before' I know her mother said softly 'her flowers aren't that pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the cold months here, that winter hibiscus. This is what matters. This describes Saeng's position perfectly - she's not the same, as happy as before, but she can get through tough times and thrive in the spring to take the test again. This shows the purpose of the last paragraph of " winter hibiscus " to show the renewal and hope that Saeng will experience.         

<START>

 

I think this sentence was chosen as the last sentence because it shows that Saeng can pass the test. Although she is not in her native country, she still has the capacity to do things. As the plant that reminds the house returns and begins to grow, Saeng will do the same. I think it's a good sentence to be at the end and you wonder if she'll pass the test.   

<START>

 

She ends the story with that because the flower gives her strength. It gives her hope and reminds her of home. At her house they were everywhere, she had to buy this one. She planted it so that it could grow in the winter. After winter, the flower grows huge and she passes her driving test. As a reward, his mother gives him a real flower from Vietnam.     

<START>

 

I think he ends his story with this paragraph because she knows she was wrong and wants to redeem herself from her mother. She also shows her mother how much she loves nature. 

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed her driver's license the first time and figured she would retake it.

I think the author used this answer because it showed she had to go through another @ DATE1 or hard work to plant flowers.

The author concluded the story "Winter Hibiscus" as she did because she wanted to show the determination of saeng at some point in the story, the author wrote, "she was still too trembling to say the words at home ". Saeng really missed his old life and his old country. She often wonders when she can get back to it and have fun, as she is still struggling to adjust to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that Saeng could be portrayed as someone who wouldn't give up easily. Although she has had problems before, the end of the story gives saeng new hope to adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives new hope. The closing sentence gives saeng and the reader new hope, that it will work on the header and do better in the spring. The author shows Saeng's determination to overcome failure and create his own niche in life. Overall, the last sentence of "Winter Hibiscus" is used to show Saeng's determination.

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she enjoys living with geese and her memories relate to the times she saw geese. I think her test is at school but she believed she would pass it by remembering her memories that she felt were linked on the outside. For example, she loves flowers. That's why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story, "Winter Hibiscus", with a very witty and confident paragraph to show that hope has an important part in our lives. In the story, "Saeng", a foreign Chinese citizen, is touched and flattened by all the majestic plants and nature that lived in the greenhouse. She ventures to find all the plants that remind her of her home and to relate them to her past experiences. As she walks around the greenhouse, she whispers and calls out the names of the nature she sees, "Saebba," Saeng whispered, "Madagascan periwinkle" was saying her tag. “It's strange to see her in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home he got wild. ! But as her tour grew over time, she soon realized that she had lost. some of her memories and started to cry. Upon arriving home, she is greeted by her mother. " I failed the test, " Saeng said. Saeng's mother is touched by her comment and encourages her by planting “hibiscus.” In the end, the author shows a strong expression by writing a last paragraph to bring out hope, and emotion, to represent that everyone deserves a second chance.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he basically says he will never take this test again. The author shows that the character does not like this test. And would rather not take it  

<START>

 

The author of the story ends with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about overcoming the obstacles ahead and tells the reader to try again. It's important to never give up and keep trying until you are successful. In the story, Saeng had just left Vietnam, he really missed that, and on top of that, saeng failed his driving test. She was really upset. She saw a group of geese flying overhead and said that when they come back in the spring and my new plant starts to grow, I will take my driving test again. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter. The cold is an obstacle for them. In addition, her new plant cannot grow until it is hot. Her plant should grow small until she can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time. You have to keep trying in order to get around them.

The short story "Winter Hibiscus ends as it does because the narrator realizes that with just a new chance or opportunity to start a rebirth comes. A passage from the text that shows the narrator's hope :" Almost to Reluctantly, she realized that a lot of things he had considered strange before, through this silent season-to-season rehearsal, are almost familiar to him now (Ho @ NUM1). This text passage shows that she realized that many things for her before suddenly had a purpose. She realized that there is a new rebirth in the spring. The concluding sentences indicate that she will retake the test in the spring. She now realizes that she now has a whole new opportunity and a whole new life to begin with. The concluding phrase of " Winter Hibiscus " is that of realizing an opportunity with the onset of spring.         

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the motivation and confidence that Saeng has after his experience with the plant. there are many reasons and examples that support this. One of the reasons is that he wants to show Saeng's change after her first test and when she boaght the flower for relief. For example, after failing a driver's license, Saeng goes to the florist. When she sees this plant, her childhood returns and she forgets her test. This flower motivates her to obtain her license. Another reason is that it shows how confident this experience has made her. For example, after a failure, she comes back saying, " ... I will take the test again." " In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to show how Saeng became confident from its experience.          

<START>

 

The author concludes this statement at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng won't give up, just like the hibiscus. For example, the hibiscus does its best to survive in the winter and blooms and starts again in the spring. Saeng will also survive the winter and start again in the spring and retake the test. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng is the hibiscus in a way that she has to start over and start over again which she failed as if the hibiscus died in winter.                  

<START>

 

My answer is, if it's winter, it's actually going to be walking in the water, having fun and whatever they do.

<START>

 

The author thus concludes the story to further interest the reader and understand that everything will happen again and again year after year.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to show that the flower was his inspiration to pass the test before. The way I got my answer was, throughout the story, @ PERSON1 was always either gardening the hibiscus or had one. It obviously showed me that she was inspired by this flower and its beauty. In conclusion, the author thus ends the story to show the importance of the Hibiscus flower for Saeng.   

<START>

 

The author thus ends the story because it represents the new birth that is about to take place. It's almost like she says she will hibernate during the winter, and when spring comes again and everything begins a new cycle of life, then she will too. Saeng "realized that a lot of things that she once considered strange before had become, through repetitions from season to season, almost familiar now." She says when the new season starts it will be her start and she will have a different outlook on her new life.   

<START>

 

The author ends the story this way to wrap it all up. The author has incorporated its nature and descriptions. This was to give the reader an idea of how spring is supposedly "beautiful or soothing".  

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it suggests that her strength will come when the flowers arrive and that she can pass the test.

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with this paragraph because it wants to show the determination of the girl in the story. At first, the girl could not help herself and bought the expensive flower. She didn't want her mother to be disappointed, so she was determined to "pass the test." In the spring, when it is time to buy more seeds, the girl wants to be able to buy the seeds. Thus, the author shows the trait of determination that the girl controls.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with When they come back, saeng silently swore, in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again "because the budding hibiscus would symbolize the start and having Saeng retake the test gives him a chance to start over and try again The hibiscus keeps budding so Saeng shouldn't stop trying! 

<START>

 

In the last paragraph of the story, the author thus concludes the story because the author means that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, mom @ CAPS1 says "Her flowers aren't pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the cold months." It is a symbol for overcoming obstacles because a flower is strong enough to get through the cold months, when the weather is harsh. In Saeng's case, it's a girl who will succeed in a foreign land. So in the last paragraph, when Saeng silently swears to herself that she will retake the driving test when the snow melts (writers completed) and the hibiscus buds, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol to overcome the obstacle of the failed the test. . This is why the author decided to end the story with this last paragraph.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination from Saeng wanting to calculate what she started. She failed the driving test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has " tear stains and puffy eyes " as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, family, etc. geese that migrate through the winter and come back again, and as new beginnings begin in the spring, so does she. A new start like hibiscus in bloom. A new start with the pilot test.     

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show the support that Saeng @ CAPS1 has given up, so neither should you. I think this paragraph describes a law of life which is "@ CAPS1 give up". @ CAPS2 even though she failed at first she is always ready to try again.  

<START>

 

When they come back, Saeng silently dedicates himself, in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese come back & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldn't push things back. You should always deal with them as they arise. So in the story the girl sets a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point not to do this. All in all, adding this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way to go and approach these certain things.     

<START>

 

She should and must also learn that you cannot replace a plant with the same thing and expect it to be just as equal. She must also learn this lesson in life. 

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will follow nature and try to integrate into his new country. Saeng failed in his examination of conduct and feeling not in his room in his new home. The text reads: “ As Saebba nedae is tall and lush. And surrounded there is garden "(# 1). When she sees her the @ CAPS1 it reminds the old house where she fits in. Now she wants to wait to see this flower grown so when she takes the driver test again.Also , she sees geese fly above her head when she plants her flower. The author writes. "... She realized that a lot of the things she had thought strange before had become ... almost familiar to her how" (not @ NUM1). The geese coming back in spring will now also remind her of her new name and how should try to live there happily now. In the last paragraph, the author writes " I will take this test again " (No @ NUM1). It feels like Saeng is trying to make a fresh start in this new home.                                                                                                                                                                                                         

<START>

 

It's a powerful phrase that illustrates the themes of the story. Saeng is determined to try again because she has been comforted by the symbol of her homeland. This sentence shows what the plant did for Saeng's spirit and shows how this symbol helps heal her. The sentence is able to conclude the story and demonstrates the importance of the hibiscus. In the story, @ CAPS1 describes the plant as a friend and a memory of its homeland. Once she sees the plant flowering, she will know she can retest. The paragraph is a great conclusion by the way because it sums up everything the hibiscus has meant for Saeng.      

<START>

 

I think the author is just trying to show that you never give up. I think the author is trying to show the beauty of nature. The author used this because in the story Saeng failed the test, but in the end it is said that she will retake the test. In the story, it is about the winter hibiscus that she planted and that ends in the conclusion. The bottom line is that there will be a new beginning.    

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with the paragraph "When they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hisbiscus buds, then I will take this test again", because the paragraph his self has already concluded. It basically summed up what she was going to do again next time because she had already done it. What the author means by this paragraph is that when the plants come back in the spring, she will have to redo all the work that was essentially the test.  

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let readers know that she's not giving up. They @ MONTH1 thought she thought the home test was more important. So, she wouldn't care about taking this test because she misses her home and wouldn't care about these tests.  

<START>

 

I think the author ends the story like that like a meterphor For people to think outside of @ CAPS1 or whatever. OR The author could end it like this so people can get a feel for what she was talking about. 

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to give you an idea of how she feels about what happened to her. This paragraph, it is she who tells herself that all is well and that she will do better next time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to give the impression that Saeng has more confidence in her. In the middle of the story, as she chatted with her mother, she seemed unconfident of herself, so this paragraph made her feel like she was sure of herself, as if she knew what was going on. 'she was going to do.   

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", I think the author concludes the story by "when they come back, Saeng swore in silence, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is frustrating, so I'm going to do this test again, "because she made Saeng believe that if this hibiscus can restart and make new flowers, the Saeng should do the same. That's why the author added this quest to the end of the story 

<START>

 

Saeng failed his driving test early in the story. She finds a hibiscus plant and buys it because it reminds her of her life in Vietnam. She said, "The familiar scent filled her lungs and Saeng could almost smell the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair." The flower reminds him of his grandmother. The mother says: " ??? Seen this genus blooming along the lake, its flowers are not quite as pretty, but they are strong enough to get through the cold months. She is trying to help her daughter feel better. He says, “Above our heads a herd of Canada geese flew by their fault, honking clearly and yes, familiar to Saeng now. She realized that a lot of things she'd considered strange before had become almost familiar to her now.         

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the end she realizes that the things that seemed strange to her before her came to realize as the seasons changed and the plants changed. The author has therefore put this paragraph at the end because in the spring, she returns to school to take the test again. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story as he or she doses because it shows that by the time she finds the plant she will get its lisenses. So it's a reminder for her. I also think she did it that way because when the plant blooms it starts again and so when she goes to take a chance on the test she starts again 

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to show that the peace that the peace the flower gave will strengthen her confidence and she will not give up. I know this because in the story the main character fails her driving test and when she sees the flower it reminds her of the house she had in Vietnam. Another reason is that the flower blooms in the spring and never stops blooming. She knows she will never give up and she realizes that she shouldn't either. Plus, the plant gives him the strength to try again. So the reason the author ends her story with this paragraph is to show the power that the flower gave her, gave her and how she will not give up.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this end paragraph because. It combines the two imperfect situations. When she said that when they come back, Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, I'll take the test again. She will prove her point and abbreviate the situation.   

<START>

 

The author says she would take the test again in the spring instead of the winter, as she would focus more on the test and not on the planting.

<START>

 

I think she ended the story with that because throughout the story she tries to work hard. And that last sentence says it's not over, that she'll be back to take the test again. She tries to prove herself throughout the book. And she will keep working hard to get what she wants    

<START>

 

In the story, the author concludes the story as she did because it's metaphorical, I say this because it compares to the hibiscus plant. As a hibiscus would be tested to overcome conditions such as cold and for example in the test, the author states that “its flowers are not so pretty, but they are strong enough to get through the cold months here. This hibiscus winter ”. She, like the hibiscus, will bloom again and have to pass the cold survival test, may have a chance to pass her own test, which is why the author concludes the story as she did.   

<START>

 

The concluding paragraph of the “ Winter Hibiscus ” story describes the powerful massage of change from a cold and distant failure to adjust to a new life. Saeng recounts his transformation to the changing seasons from winter to spring. it's obvious, as it says, "in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding". she accepts this as another chance to start over, then tries to pass the test. The transition from winter to spring symbolizes the difficulties of saeng to fly to adapt to his new home. And then, as the geese return and the hibiscus adapts to its new surroundings, this is the symbol by which saeng follows from its old home in Vietnam, but can now thrive elsewhere as well.                              

<START>

 

 The author concludes with this because it had the most impact. The ending also made the most sense. The meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she lives now. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again, this could have a double meaning and mean that the author's life will bloom again. Overall, it was a good way to end the paragraph.      

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", I believe they end the story as they did, "when they come back saeng silently dedicates himself, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, so I will do the test again "because with saeng setting a goal, she overcomes her disappointment and discomfort at living in a new country. The archetypal meaning of a flower bud is : thrive, new, growth. It shows that he is growing up and that is important in life and that is why the end is as they did. It's a positive ending. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that it realizes its connection with the hibiscus plant. Throughout the story, Saeng thinks of the native plants she has seen before can now be found at @ LOCATION1. She sees how they are adapted to life there, like how the hibiscus can survive the winter. Saeng realizes that she also has to adjust to her new home. She doesn't necessarily need to adapt in order to survive, but in order to be successful. She swears that in the spring, when the hibiscus buds (begins its growing cycle again), she will also start over and retest.     

<START>

 

In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author's last paragraph shows how much hibiscus means to her. The author uses the symbolism when he talks about the hibiscus because it is a strong plant just like the girl needs to be to pass the driver's license. The author has put the paragraph at the end to show that if the hibiscus can come back, after the winter, the girl too. In conclusion, the author used the last paragraph to emphasize the meaning of hibiscus.   

<START>

 

The story is full of emotion and homesickness which can be a bit depressing, so the author wanted to end with a message of hope. After saeng failed the test "in the main greenhouse shelter (she broke down and cried), it is inspiring to know that she will continue to try despite all her difficulties." I know first-hand that homesickness can be quite severe, and finding the strength to go on and promise to “take this test again” can be very difficult but worthwhile. The author also used the ending to give hibiscus another meaning because "when the geese come back and the hibiscus blooms", when the winter is over, the hard times are over, there will be new hope in a new and beautiful spring.       

<START>

 

The reason the author ended the story with this paragraph was that basically it explained everything you needed to know until the end. This basically explains why she is ready to take the time to study for the test she had already taken and failed and wants to take it again once spring arrives. For example, the geese were gone for the winter. and once back in the spring, she will take the test again, in conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it best explains the end of the story.   

<START>

Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the most of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her even sadder in her desire to return home. She bought the flower to, in a sense, bring it home. When spring arrives, it will bud with the flower and pass the test again.

 The author leaves the story there because it lets you guess what will happen. This is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has already told and the future is a whole different story. It doesn't matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens during the winter.

The author concluded with this paragraph because daughter Saeng will hopefully enjoy her new home and in a year she will be used to what is happening in her new country. Saeng just doesn't feel out of place and wants to wait a while until she tries to take the test again.

The author could end the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not @ CAPS1 to stop trying to @ CAPS1 to work harder. Seeing the geese adapt, she chooses to give it a try. and make their wew work at home. After they disappear, she gets up and says she has to @ CAPS1 to try again. By doing this, she commits to trying things @ CAPS2 to accommodate the changes.    

<START>

 

I think she ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test at @ DATE1 when it won't be that hard for her. It will be hot again and it will not be that cold.

The story ends with this paragraph for a number of reasons. First, in the spring it is warm and sunny, which ended the story on a happy note. Then it shows that Saeng can adapt to his new home, as the hibiscus will overwinter. Finally, it shows that Saeng is determined and won't let his mother down. This is why the story ends with this paragraph.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt, then so can she. "In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again." “I chose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happened to her. She should be able to adjust to a new place like them.

Authors often end stories with a paragraph that makes readers wonder what happens next. In Winter Hibiscus from: Minfong Ho, there is an end paragraph like that. The author ends thus because she is turned towards the future. She says she'll pass the test when the snow melts, the kids come back, and the hibiscus blame. She looks at him like it's a new beginning. She wants to start over. Plus, the peacock, blossoming hibiscus, and melted spectacle give her hope that she will pass her test. She now believes they have a hibiscus, maybe it will be more like where she used to live. Authors use endings that make people wonder if people are thinking.        

<START>

 

The answer that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted us to read the story to understand what was happening in the story. like for the @ CAPS1 they said when they come back Saeng silently swore in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding so I will be taking this test again, trying to see where everyone is heading in the story so that they can understand what the author is talking about.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story from the paragraph because geese and hibiscus are the two things that were familiar to Saeng They remind her of her homeland, when familiar things return she will have the strength to the test again and hopefully do better.The narrator says "Overhead , Canada geese have flown over, their skinny hunks are clear and - yeah akin to Saeng now ". .        

<START>

 

The author included this paragraph because the hibiscus plant makes him think about where it came from and helps him achieve certain things. I know the hibiscus is from her home country because in the story she said " I mean, not like the kind we had at - at - " she found out that she was still too shaky. to say the words at home. " She misses being at home and this plant helps bring back memories of being there. Therefore, the author has included this paragraph to show the reader that he misses his homeland.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph why @ CAPS1 this might be important to the author about Saeng. It's something personally about her past or where she came from. She's trying to say that when she comes back in the spring, she'll take the test again at school. OR She's going to replant something in the spring @ CAPS1. Like snow @ CAPS2 and it's too cold to plant anything. What she came from is really important to her and she misses it and returned to where she came from.     

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with "When they come back Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is building, then I will take the test again." She is doing it because in history this plant has given her a lot of self-confidence at @ MONTH1 to do better in the future.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story this way for several reasons. One of the reasons is that she will have more experience with her new country. She only left her native country a few months ago, so in about six months she will know the ways of the new country better. This will make her more able to pass the @ CAPS1 Ed test. It is also in the spring that the flower will be beautiful again and this will give it new strength which will make it die. The few months will allow the author to prepare mentally and physically for the exam. Mentally, she will be able to study and learn whatever she needs to know. And physically she will age which will also teach her new things.       

<START>

 

In order to overcome his failure, Saeng bought a flower that reminded him of his home. Saeng started to cry when she bought the flower. She wanted to go home. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show how she will pass the test when she feels at home. "When the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that test again," Saeng thought to himself. These things make her feel welcome and feeling so will help her in her test. The paragraph concludes the story with all the things she's comfortable with. This conclusion helps the reader understand what reminds them of home. Also explain how the hibiscus flower is lying to her. Buying the flower helps him with his problems. Seeing geese flying reminds him of his home. The author concludes the story with the memories that will help Saeng in the future.           

<START>

 

I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because everyone should be given a fresh start, or a second chance. I guess the author left a message that if you fail once you should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test, it seemed like his self-esteem dropped and his mother tried to cheer him up, and eventually she realized that it would be wrong to give up and not try again with a new start.

Minfong Ho included the last paragraph of the story as it hinted at how saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of his house. when saeng saw the hibiscus she had a " so intense, it was almost visceral " feeling . The flower was creatively used by Ho. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to get through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph that this flower should give some hope and confidence in saeng. making a V that I enraged would mean Vietnam to saeng, which is what the author is trying to make his reader think. This is why “ and the geese are coming back ”. is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants its readers to realize that the objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author has done a great job putting that last thought in the last paragraph because it sums up the lesson perfectly, which is that you need to do things when you feel confident and feel at home. You @ MONTH1 are small and fragile, but if you 'mess up' you can confidently thrive.       

<START>

 

The last paragraph at the end of the story was how the writers showed how Saeng wanted spring to come early because she wanted to see her hibiscus. If spring doesn't come quickly, she won't see her hibiscus, and the snow won't melt. When Saeng arrives, she hopes to be able to pass the test.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the phrase "When they return, saeng silently vowed, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." »Because this winter the hibiscus symbolizes for her a new beginning. For example, in her hometown she had hibiscus and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well she moved to the United States, and she didn't have hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels out of place and doesn't fit in. So, when she saw this winter hibiscus, she felt like she had found something to make her feel at home or almost at ease. She felt a sense of security. In conclusion, the author ended with this sentence because it is a new beginning for her and the hibiscus means a new beginning.  

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it looks like her own life, that she will have another chance, just as the geese will return. The reason the last part looks like her life is because she says spring spring is usually a good time of year as it gets warmer around @ DATE2 and the flowers are coming back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and this will, in a way, renew his warm thought of his old home. This will then be the time to retake her failed driving test, before she buys the plant. The author added this last part because it fit the story so well.    

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the store with a small paragraph is that at some point the little things matter most and the author thinks that in two rounds he could sum up the most important things in the story. story and I think the author did a good job.

<START>

 

The author concludes with a paragraph because Saeng has to pass the test everywhere. She @ MOIS1 thinks there is a better chance when it is blooming and the snow is melting. That's when Saeng will try to do the test after the snow melts and the hibiscus bloom.  

<START>

 

The author concludes with this sentence for several reasons. Saeng thinks she can't do it until spring because when the geese come back. This is also when the hibiscus buds. In a way, she feels like she is blossoming in the spring and passing the test.   

<START>

 

I think the author includes this paragraph in this story because the grandma might think it's a test to see what she can do @ CAPS1 time. Grandma could do more than @ CAPS2. 

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story like this because @ MONTH1 be, she says at that point she will be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @ MONTH1 be at that time, when it happens in the spring, she would be ready and more confident in herself. @ MONTH1 either the author was trying to say that just like the start of a new spring, it would be a new beginning for her.  

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng says she will try again. For example, despite having failed her driver's license, she decides to take it back after having experienced planting with her mother. It seems that planting the hibiscus has given him some confidence in his efforts to be successful again. In the story, it seemed like she was getting used to crashing. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished something, she knows that she can take the test again and complete it. In conclusion, this is why I think the author concluded with this paragraph.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with a sobering statement as it wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and must adapt to the environment. Saeng had just failed her driving test, so she's disappointed with that. The final sentence makes you realize that Saeng can overcome his driving challenges if the factory can overcome the harsh environment.   

<START>

 

the author includes it as the last paragraph because it might give Saeng's mother some hope. It might give hope as they might really need Saeng to pass the test. 

<START>

 

It was very important that the author concludes the story with this paragraph. He restored the meaning of hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had to overcome her problems by living in a new place. Without this paragraph, we would have been left guessing what was to come from Saeng. In some stories it would have worked, but in this case it was necessary. When she saw the hibiscus for the first time, she collapsed because she could not remember her homeland. This is why the hibiscus is so important in history. By reaffirming the importance of this one at the end, the reader was able to follow what was to follow, even though the story was over. It was important to express it again. In the last paragraph it says, " This hibiscus is budding, so I'll take this test again." " The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome its problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be suspended. The meaning of the story is very clear with her as a reader.               

<START>

 

Including taking the test again when 'the hidiscus is sprouting' gives a sense of closure and lesson to an otherwise open ending. Saeng fails the driving test at the beginning of the story, then on the way home, she buys a hibiscus. The reader really does not see a link until this last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perseverance and strength. After a harsh winter, this hibiscus can bloom again and continue to live. Even after leaving Vietnam and struggling to adjust, Saeng must recover and keep trying. Just like the flower that blossoms again, Saeng will do the same. She will take the test a second time and pass it. It will adapt to its environment, and will continue, just like the hibiscus.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph "When they are back , Saeng has vowed silently to her - even in the spring , when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding , the I 'll take the test again, " because the author started on the story after Saeng failed his driving test . Saeng is remembered of the Hibiscus of his homeland. After Saeng wanted the Hibiscus in the garden , " a flock he Canada Geese flow by," as they flew by Saeng felt a sign to comfort and vowed to himself what started it all . If Saeng has made passing the driving test then it would of never found the Hibiscus.

The author included it because her mother took the test and passed it and her daughter wanted to do the same, as did her mother. And she can only take it in the spring because there are no flowers in the winter. 

<START>

 

Thinking, the author tries to show that Saeng is finally beginning to come to terms with and overcome the difficulties in life. It shows that she has finally gotten used to @ LOCATION1 and the customs, but she still hasn't forgotten her heritage. "But she had far preferred it to a fat Mac herself." It also proves that she is going to be positive and not be fooled by the record. She will take it back and try again. At first, look at his situations in life. But after visiting the flower shop, she discovers one more cherry. Optimistic perspective on his situation and decides to do something.       

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. I think one of the reasons is that she concludes that winter is here, and when winter is over she will start flowering and planting again. In the story it says, "The winter hibiscus was now in the ground, ...." So now she has to wait for the winter to pass, then the hibiscus will start to grow and will be, hopefully alone in the spring. That's why I think she concluded the story the way she did.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of what about his test? There had to be an answer and that was when she was comfortable taking it. In the text. To her, the plant was soft and cool as she had known it, which was heartwarming. She closed her palm around it and held him tight. At least that she could hang on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, sadness and maybe disappointment, which she probably feels like dealing with for a while, which his mother even hinted at in the conclusion. cry of surprise and delight at seeing the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals that she paid over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I think she will be more comfortable then. planned because she will have new and old things to come home to, like geese and plants.                       

<START>

 

In the story “ Winter Hibiscus ,” the author includes this end paragraph because she wants to show that next time she will be prepared and ready for the garden and the challenges it presents. This first time, she wasn't ready, and she didn't know about winter hisbiscus because she had never done anything like it before.   

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the story ends by saying "in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again". this shows that even though she @ MONTH1 failed the test once she won't give up just because of the change in fit. The Hibiscus made the reader understand that a plantation where it lives can adapt, just like it. 

<START>

 

The reason she ended the story like this is because when everything blossoms she will feel more comfortable and be in good health. I say this because the girl used to help her grandmother cut her hair before moving out. So if the flower bloomed, it would remind her of her grandmother who would be unresponsive to do the test well.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving the melting of the snow, the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus. It is explaining moments in time. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is.  

<START>

 

The author ended the story with this paragraph because it tells how Saeng feels as winter approaches and how she has to wait until spring returns to have her snack again.       

<START>

 

Saeng cares about flowers. She cares about the flower. Natural occurrence with them becoming more and more unique.  

<START>

 

In the story, I don't know why the author and the story with that, I really don't know, maybe she was talking about her passed all the tests now, she wouldn't take it again . The times are coming. She was in school and when we took the test it was that kind of wealth, now it's not @ DATE1 and school is over.  

<START>

 

Why the author concludes this paragraph in the story is because at the end of the story they needed and ending. Also why is it because the choice and the conclusion that would best suit this story. 

<START>

 

I believe the author chose to wrap up the story the way they did because the story was about perseverance. For example, the story was based on the winter hibscus. This is a good example because at the end of the day Saeng swears that she will persevere and retake her test and the hibiscus will persevere and forge all winter so she doesn't let herself die. Another example where @ CAPS1's mom worked outside in the cold to do her gardening. This relates to the story because she stayed in the cold garden to do her job, she could have quit and walked into the lovely warm house just like Saeng could have resigned and said she was not going try to take his test again. But she didn't, she said she was going to try again.     

<START>

 

I think the author has finished this story as it because that it wants to say that she has not given up, even if it failed the first time she came again. . “ means when everything is @ CAPS1.” She will try to do it again because if she succeeds, it will be @ CAPS1. The story was really bad because I don't even know what she missed so I didn't like it.                                                         

<START>

 

I think the reason the author ended the story with this "when they come back Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding . Then I'll go through this test again. Paragraph because like that, the plant had no chance of surviving in winter and it was the same with the girl when she passed her driver's license, but in the spring, the plant has a chance to flower, so it has a chance to pass the test because it is time and place for everything.  

<START>

 

Emotion, mint, hope, are all reasons why the author ended the story with "when they return Saeng silently vowed, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and when this hibiscus will bud, then I will take the test again. " @ CAPS1, this last paragraph shows that she has emotion. Then it shows that she has commitment, she says that when the hibiscus comes back, she will take the test again. Finally, it shows that there is hope and she will try to pull herself together.These are all the reasons she used the last paragraph.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to underline his new determination to overcome his obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, "she realized that a lot of things she had thought strange before had become, through the silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar to her." At this point, she has an epiphany and realizes that life is like the seasons. In the last paragraph, she intercedes by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus runs along the winter, then blooms in the spring, it must be strong in these difficult times. One day, her time will come for her to " bloom ". @ CAPS1 is going through tough times, but we all need to be strong and unwavering as we wait for our hour to "blossom".        

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show that she was not going to give up just because she had failed once. She has already failed the test once. She was very sad about it. She went to buy a plant. Saeng's mother told him they were going to do it the right way. Saeng was crying when she told her mother about it. His mother was very understanding. Her mother could have been very angry with her. She could have used a plant they were growing. The @ MONTH1 plant is not growing at the moment. She should have bought a real plant from someone else.            

<START>

 

Determined, fresh start, symbolism - each is a reason I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after purchasing the plant and is newly determined to pass the test she talks about. Seeing the geese flying above her head, she realizes the determination they must have and vows to do better in the test next year. With the new flower, she has the impression of starting over again to be able to pass this test which seems important to her. When the author writes, " and the geese will come back and this budding hibiscus, then I will take this test again ", it shows symbolism. Recounting the blooming of new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf. Determined, fresh start, symbolism - each is a reason I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.        

<START>

 

The author of " Winter Hibiscus " in Ho Minfong ends the story by saying : " when they get Saeng vowed silently, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese will come back and that hibiscus sprout , then I'll take the test again ”, because it showed that Saeng had overcome his problem and was committed to correcting it. In closing with this statement, the author showed that the beauty of nature can help overcome one's problems, as Saeng did. Seeing the Mignity Geese and the 'Winter Hibiscus' Saeng, “realized that many things that she once considered strange had become, through season after season mistletoe repetition, almost familiar to her now. Like geese. Saeng realized that the test, while strange and different to her, had become familiar to her due to her experiences with nature. See geese and "Winter Hibiscus". This plant also reminded Saeng of her past in Vietnam and all the good times she spent at home. “The familiar scent filled his lungs, and Saeng could almost fast the light lengths of his grandmother's long gray hair, freshly squashed. " The jolont reminded him of good experiences. In the factory made her happy enough not to think about the past, but about the future, about resuming the test and her new life in the United States.                                 

<START>

 

The reason the author puts this last line in the story of the end is to show us the raids and saeng that even though we are almost done. She doesn't want it to end but she knows it will start again too. Next year when things get back to how they were before everything changed. That's why I think the author put this line in the story.           

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with Saeng swearing to himself "in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will do this test again" to express his determination to adapt to new things and expressing the change she was getting used to. Describing spring was important in the conclusion as it described what Saeng once thought was strange in @ LOCATION1, but got used to the seasons and the changing climate. Once she realized she had to deal with the change, she knew she would have to retry the driver's license. It was very important that the author's conclusion was "in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again" because it expressed how Saeng accepted the change in his life.    

<START>

 

In "Winter Hibiscus", the author uses the hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adjusting to new life, and Saeng's home country at the end of the story, I think the author realizes that even if she failed the test everything is going to be fine. Looking at the hibiscus, she remembers her old life, which she loved, and the natural beauty that can be found in a hibiscus flower. In life, I think everyone should always remember that even if an @ MONTH1 is disappointed at some point, we need to keep in mind that life goes on. There will always be another chance, as long as you can find peace and beauty in something good.   

<START>

 

The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng's strength and abilities. She knows that it is only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, that she will be ready to take the test again. His hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. This is why the author concluded with this paragraph.    

<START>

 

I believe the author ends the story with this paragraph because it refers to earlier events in the story. For example, it is written “ and this hibiscus is budding ”. It refers to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it reminded him of his home. It's a good way to end a story. I wouldn't change it at all if I could. Also in the summary before the story it says how she failed her driving test and in the last paragraph it says "Then I will take this test again", I think Saeng didn't have much. self-confidence before taking the test because of her. a new environment but it's now that she knows everything and has found a hobby that she will think about succeeding by taking the test again. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failures.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she won and wants to redo the quiz for herself and prove it to no one else. she says, "when they come back, saeng swore, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, then I'll take that test again." So she says she wants to take the test again. So she doesn't have to take it. She takes it to prove herself to no one else.

In Minfong Ho's short story " Winter Hibiscus ", a young girl named saeng remembers her life before moving to @ LOCATION1. She misses her homeland and all the things she loved before coming here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng has sworn to retake his driving test at the end of winter, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a reason. He / She wants to show that the saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and that it will be ready when the tiring days of winter have passed and the beautiful days of spring arrive. Saeng's mother says, "… it's strong enough to get through the cold months…. That's what matters." The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to the saeng in that, like it, it is strong enough to survive the winter months.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to keep the reader wanting more. When an author finishes a chapter of a story or episode of a show, it's always a good idea to use a cliffhanger to entice the audience. In many stories have read this is used. In my @ CAPS1, the @ PERSON1 book, it always ends with a cliff-hanger. As at the end of the third volume, one of the soldiers is killed but you will not know by whom until the next volume.    

<START>

 

The author concludes this story as she does to say that the young girl will not give up trying to integrate into this new country. The author concludes this way because he mentions that it is not over, and even if the test was unsuccessful, it will not be next time. The author lets it be known that the little girl cares about the test and wants to prove to people that she can pass it. She remembers her house by these flowers, and with that she can take it back and make the rite of it.   

<START>

 

I think the author included this in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold, so she would wait for the snow to melt and the geese to come back to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed the test and in the spring she will take the test.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it ends both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things do happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you have to also pick you up if what happens knocks you down. Seeing geese and hibiscus, she realizes that everyone has to adjust to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt our way of driving here, as well as all of our rules and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in this way.

Saeng was taking a test and she didn't quite pass it. She was afraid to tell her mother but she has to tell him anyway. Her mother got angry because she was unsuccessful. Saeng knows that right after winter is over she will take the same test again and she hopes she passes it this time.

In the story "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they return, Saeng silently dedicates himself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. - because she wanted the story to end with Saeng finding the positive opinions about her new home and the positive ones in the future and looked forward to it. Throughout the news, Saeng turns out to have a sad temper about his new home and how the plants remind him of his recent home. - "I mean, it's not the kind we like -" she found she was still too shaky to say the words at home, the last time she burst into tears again. - This sentence shows that Saeng really missed his house and was really sad about it. The concluding sentence shown above shows that she has found the strength to look positively at the future of her new home.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story Saeng went to take a driving test but did not pass and so she is going to buy a hibiscus which reminds her of her home and gives her strength and comfort. . So her mom says this at the end because she knows Saeng is having a hard time adjusting to her new country and she doesn't want to put more pressure on him just because she knows that Saeng is very upset and is trying to to catch up. to her by buying her a flower so she says that next spring she should be fit and ready for the test because the flower should give her hope. She wants her to know that she has three years to go.

I think the author of "Winter Hibiscus" said "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, I will take the test again ." to conclude the story for many reasons. The first reason is that it shows that she is not giving up. The second reason is that it gives a sense of hope for what is to come. The last reason is that it leaves us wondering if she will do it next time. This is probably why the author ended it this way.

The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with the paragraph to show the connection between the hibiscus and @ CAPS1. The hibiscus must survive the winter until spring when it can flower and grow tall and beautiful. @ CAPS1 connects to the flower and says it can overcome the obstacles of changing environment if the flower can stand being confined in a plastic container and survive the elements. She feels that at the moment she loves the Hibiscus. She is trapped because the area is foreign to her and she has to adapt. Just as the container is foreign to the flower because it is used to being free. But once planted, it will be part of its environment and will grow. And once she accepts the change and becomes ready to start over, she will start to grow taller and it will make her driving test easier. In conclusion, this is the reason why the author concluded the paragraph with this sentence.

In the short story " Winter Hibiscus ", the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will pass the test " when the snow melts and the geese come back ". I believe the Hibiscus and the test drive are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts early, it may flower later, so the author has included it to show that Saeng wilted early, but will flower in the spring. It is also a symbol of its constant development. The intention of the author of the lost line was demonstrated early on when Saeng was disappointed that he had failed the test. She's upset that she failed her driving test, but when she sees a flower from her native land, she starts to get aroused and cry a little. It shows that she is thriving because she goes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower of her childhood memory. This shows that she fades and blossoms again when she announces the news of the test to her mother. At first, she becomes nervous and scared, so scared that she tears off the leaf and shreds it. His mother then wipes the green material and asks him to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and begins to feel better. This shows once again that she is blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and gives himself the determination to achieve his goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives and to blossom again. The Hibiscus shows this with its budding stage. He will flower like Saeng.

The author probably includes part of the story with the paragraph to put more detail into the paragraph. The author trying to talk about the life Saeng had sworn to himself in silence in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I will do this test again saying that when the flowers start blooming again and the spring will come again thats when i will take this test and pass this time. 

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this because it proves that she has the strength to do something that she failed again the first time around. She took this plant and regarded it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of his home and his promise. Saeng said, "It's not a real one." "Not like the kind we had before." Saeng loved the house and wished he was back there, but his new promise was what mattered.

The author concludes this story with this paragraph because it is the start of a whole new day. This saying means that she is going to take the test on a new day grass. For example, the geese return her spring and her hibiscus budd and she has the test in the spring so it will begin why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

This last paragraph is written for several reasons. First of all, she will try again when she feels the time is right. Just like the returning geese, Saeng will come back to take the test, and so the Hibiscus plant will flower again. She thinks it's the right thing to do and that it will be a good time to come back for the test. This paragraph describes Saeng well on how she lives and how she will retake the test when she feels it is right.    

<START>

 

I believe the author ends because it shows that Saeng is determined to pass the test. “She stopped by noticing the tear stains on her daughter's cheeks and her swollen eyes.” (Ho) This quote shows that passing the test meant a lot to Saeng. She was crying because she couldn't help but buy the plant and fail the test. She didn't want to fail and showed her sadness by crying. then I will take the test again. (Ho) This quote shows that even though she failed, she is determined to take the test and succeed. The failure hurt her a lot. so she can't wait to start over and succeed because she is determined to succeed. This is all important because Saeng shows that determination is the key to success and she is determined.

<START>

 

The author concludes with this sentence for emphasis. This distracts Saeng's mind from the flower and she focuses on her test. Until next spring to take the test, it gives him something to look forward to. This statement also shows that you should never give up on anything you do. The author ends on a good note by explaining this. The last paragraph is also a break with the rest of the story and with what Saeng had just done. These are Saeng's last and final thoughts.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph which I think to say that when the hibiscus begins to grow back it will be back to what it started.

She is showing determination as she declares that she will take this test again and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will retake the test in the spring.

The author concludes the story with "When they come back Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again."

He demonstrates it in the story when he says the quote above. This quote shows that Saeng can try something and fail, and then be determined to try and succeed again. Also in the story, Saeng moved from one country to another. It's a huge leap and for her, being confident with herself is very persistent. The way the author concludes the story, with "when they come back Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take that test again" definitely portrays Saeng , the main character as a persistent person, and that is the point of the quote.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants the urtose to reflect on what he said in order to want to know more. For example, I was reading a book that ends with a question and wanted to know more about the answer to the question. Another example is I was reading another book that ended with a stenting So I want to read another book that they have but they don't have one so I don't know how the story ended.

I think the reason the author ended the story with this paragraph is that this will be when she thinks she's ready to take the driving test again.

The author concludes this story this way to pick up on the important points of the story. "I'll take that test again" was the test she had failed that day. The test she failed tested her memory of her home. Her old country was so important to her. The part of the quote " when they come back ... when they show it to me and the geese come back " refers to when she says : " She realized that a lot of things that she considered strange before had become… almost familiar to her. Like geese, ”she says while in this country she is starting to get used to loving geese that fly south every winter. When she uses " and this hibiscus is budding " she says she will remember all the things she forgot when she moved here to this country. " When she arrived at the Hibiscus, she reached out and gently touched a petal. It was smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center - just as she had imagined. This whole statement is basically saying that she is starting to forget things about her country as this country becomes more familiar, but when the geese come back in the direction of @ DATE1, she will remember again and she will take this test of her knowledge again. and will succeed.

<START>

 

I believe saeng made this silent wish for herself because after the plant has gone through the harsh winter and once everything goes back to how she likes it and the plant starts budding again, that sort of represents its difficulty in move, so if this plant she loves so much can get away with it, then she can too.

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" concludes the story with the excerpt "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will iron this again. test "because it underlines Saeng's pain of arriving in an unfamiliar place and failing his first test, but also underlines Saeng's determination to work hard after seeing a flower that looked like one from her home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads "And besides, he was another old friend. A small shrub with waxy leaves and delicate flowers with purplish petals and white centers." This excerpt demonstrates Saeng's love for her hometown through a flower she knows how to grow in her home. Another example is when Saeng told his mother the bad news "I failed the test" @ CAPS1 the attention was instantly drawn to the flower and his mother could not help but be kind.

The hibiscus represented the connection to Saeng's past, as described when the author wrote: "Plants that she didn't even realize she knew but had forgotten brought her back into the world." of his childhood. The hibiscus was from her homeland, and by helping Saeng remember her past, she started to face the present, and later the future, and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding so I will do this test again.

So when the geese come back in the spring and the flower blooms again, she will be ready to adapt more to @ CAPS1's life and pass her driving test. The geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory from his old home at @ LOCATION1 which he misses a lot. After these things try to adjust to the @ CAPS1 lifestyles.

In the passage "winter hibiscus" the author uses this phrase in the last paragraph "when they came back, Saeng silently swears, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that Test again. I believe she concluded this story with these words that she changes because she tells you in this sense when the birds are gone. Even the seasons of the birds would be back as always. One example of this is when she says the birds have settled in the hibiscus. Confused because the last paragraph thinking she would stay again next season and very key what she likes to do. What I leave out as the last paragraph is the 'winter hibiscus' story like what it means to me.

I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it was not for the little girl and that she was not going to give up planting flowers and that when spring came and the snow had melted she was gonna plant more flowers and see how they go in the spring even though it didn't work out as well as the winter season she let her stop it i think the author is trying to say if you do something and it doesn't work keep trying, maybe something different will happen.

The author of this story ends the story with this paragraph because he explains how Saeng will not give up, just like the hibiscus does not. Earlier in the story, he explains how the winter hibiscus does not die. In the paragraph, when it says the snows are melting, it means the seasons will continue, just as Saeng should go on and try. Also, when the author says and the geese come back, it means the geese will keep coming back just as Saeng should keep trying to pass the test.   

<START>

 

I believe the author used these lines in the last paragraph "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." @ CAPS1 he really liked it. 

<START>

 

I think the author concludes these paragraphs to make the story more meaningful. The author might have wanted to show more details in the story.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how she will start again by repeating the test, just as the hibiscus will start again by budding new flowers. Saeng shows us how she will try to overcome the obstacles she faces, just as the hibiscus flower and the geese will overcome the winter. In the story, the author uses hibiscus to adapt to changes in life. In a way, the winter hibiscus represents Saeng because the flower adapts to circumstances, the circumstance being winter. Much like the hibiscus flower, Saeng must overcome his obstacles of being in a new country and retake his driving test.    

<START>

 

"When they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." is the paragraph the author uses to conclude the story. In my opinion, the author included this paragraph to conclude the story to show that Saeng is committed to adjusting to his new home and leaving the old one. For example, in the story, Saeng was unable to say " I mean, not like the kind we had at home ". without bursting into tears. This illustrates his grief and his inability to let go of his past.         

<START>

 

The author could have ended the story with this paragraph for many reasons. He / she probably finished with the paragraph to show that Saeng cared about adjusting to his new place and was not failing or giving up. The author also likely ended the story this way to show that Saeng was determined to be successful and make his mother happy. That is why the author ended the story with the paragraph.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus gives Saeng a little glimmer of hope. The hibiscus reminds him of his homeland, Vietnam, which he likes. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she buys can survive the winter, unlike the hibiscus of her native country, symbolizes Saeng's determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's survival and adaptation to his new country, which will include his resumption of his driving test.   

<START>

 

The author concludes his story with this statement for many reasons. First of all, the Hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing. therefore, Saeng will also be strong. In addition, Saeng gives himself time to adapt and get used to his new surroundings. She sets a real goal. Saeng identifies with the flower. It comforts her and brings back precious memories of the things she loved and the things that made her happy, like her home country and her grandmother.      

<START>

 

The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng's determination . I say this hibiscus in the story sees her plant and she is thrilled to see it and is so happy but the recalls doing her grandmother's hair she tries. She's snowing this as a test for herself. She wants to see if she could be on and try not to want on the past. When she is not at home, she says " I failed the test ". This snowmelt she wants is moving on, but it hasn't been as easy as she hoped. So when this hibiscus shows the life of this paragraph, it shows that Saeng is trying to move on and that she is different from an English her seal.                                                               

<START>

 

In the story, I believe Saeng is sad because he misses his house and the hibiscus flower. She ends the story well because she can now have some peace with herself while waiting to take the test again. I believe that's why she ended the story the way she did so she didn't worry or get angry. She can turn a negative attitude into a positive one when she says she will retest when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding.   

<START>

 

The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng will try to adapt to his new home. He lets you know that Saeng is no longer going to cry and be sad, but she will adjust and go on with her life. The author adds this: "I mean, not like the kind we had @ NUM1at-". It was then that Saeng just got home and talked to his mother and she is very sad because she thought of old memories in her old house, but adding the last statement in the story, it shows that Saeng has decided to move on with his life and not be sad anymore. She set herself the goal of accepting it. This is the reason why the author concludes his story as he does.     

<START>

 

Many writers end their story in different ways. But Minfong Ho ended his with almost a saying. One of the reasons she ended her story this way is because she kind of revealed what would happen to Saeng in the future. As at the end, it says "I will take this test again". This lets the reader know that she, the author, might write another story about Saeng, but that's when she takes the test again. A second example shows that Saeng is strong and good-looking but he will try again. It's the show when the author said "when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding". see she said this hibiscus that refers to Saeng. Without some of these writing techniques and tips, we might not know if there will be a sequel and what could happen.       

<START>

 

The author must have put this in the story to show the change. Because all we give is we give, we do, we reimburse the author. People don't think about small damage, they are comrades with big changes. The little ones count the turnig sioteero and I have to tie as for. On top of that, the old angels to lead. We all go through tough times, big and small, but we all have to get over them     

<START>

 

This is a very important paragraph for the narrator to put in the story. For example, Saeng says his new house with its flowers is more important than school and a test. And, saeng doesn't have a lot of friends she goes to see at school but her hibiscus will remind her of all the old friends she made. Saeng just tells herself that once everything is back to normal or as she wishes, she can take this test again. In conclusion, the narrator used this paragraph to let us know how saeng is feeling.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it concludes and concludes the story. It shows the relationship between nature, adaptation and how it all calmed her down after failing the test. 

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter until spring, the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will bloom into flowers of different colors. After all the flowers had bloomed, the leaves were out and the pollin had found the right kind of trees. At the end of @ DATE2 in the fall, the leaves start to die and change color, then the leaves fall off. Then it snows again.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph “ When they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will retest the test ”, because it shows that Saeng not going to stay downstairs. This shows that the hibiscus will weather the winter, as Saeng's mother says, "'... but it's strong enough to get through the cold months here, this hibiscus winter is what matters." This symbolizes Saeng overcoming not only the failure of the driving test, but also the transition to @ LOCATION1. She's not the same as she was back home, but she's strong enough to go through this change in her life. In addition, taking the test in the spring symbolizes a new beginning, when everything is new and she has overcome her winter. This end paragraph is so important because it shows Saeng's promise that she will overcome the challenges that face her and @ CAPS1 ahead. When Saeng says "... When the snows melt ...", it symbolizes the moment in his life when his failures will become good again. She will pass the test with a new outlook on her life. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is not going to stay down.          

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph. " Where Saeng swore in silence, " in the springtime when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again. Minpong Ho did it because she failed the test. Saeng failed to refine the fine-toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and his sweet grandmother. Apparently, these things could be found after the snow melts and the geese and budding hibiscus retreat.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's vision for the future. It's a fitting conclusion, drawn from many elements of the story, and it shows how Saeng grew up. Saeng refers to “ When the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding ”. In this sentence, she shows a growing acceptance and even affection for her new homeland. Geese are "familiar to Saeng now" although she considers them "strange before". The hibiscus is a piece of its past, adapted to its current situation. Saeng's wish that she “will take this test again” in the spring, “When the snows melt…”, etc. It shows that despite so many losses - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the most of her situation. She plans to pass her driving test in the spring, no matter what. The concluding paragraph is an appropriate way to end the story. This is how the thrends of Saeng's past and his present are intertwined, and shows his attitude towards the future. With its upbeat words, the last paragraph almost ties the mood of optimism in the midst of regret. The author's writing is very well done.              

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story it says "I will take this test again". So she tries to say that she will do it to how well she has adapted to the changes in life. In the story it is also stated "when they return" This concludes that when the flower returns next season. She will remember how much she will remember her homeland, her grandmother and the good things.   

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because he wanted the reader to know that another story will be made up. To also show that Saeng was not happy that the snow is melting and the geese are coming back and the hibiscus is budding.   

<START>

 

Now that she knows a lot about plants, the narrator gives the impression that the girl is interested in @ CAPS1.R. @ CAPS1. The new world and the different plants that bloom and are so beautiful in the season so the way I see it is the girl really loves plants and the feature for me I say she is an adventurous girl who loves to explore new worlds and see what is there to be explained. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome his weaknesses and be successful in his new home. What is the @ CAPS1 "In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again." This means that she will try the @ CAPS2 test again and try a new test to make her understand where she is and what she can @ CAPS3 from it.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is a determined young girl. By swearing to take the "test" again, she shows that she is determined and that she is not giving up. Another reason is that the author wanted to stress the importance of Saeng's idea of personality.   

<START>

 

Minfong Ho concluded the story with this because it shows Saeng's determination to pass the driving test. The fact that she failed made her feel bad and brought out feelings of homesickness like the familiar plant did, but in that final paragraph, she swears she'll overcome all of her challenges of be in an unfamiliar place and pull himself together to accomplish it. goal just like winter hibiscus. 

<START>

 

The author included this sentence in the paragraph because Saeng was a very determined girl. She would keep trying until she was successful. No matter how long or hard it would be, she would. Just like in the photo of the hibiscus flower next to the highway. He certainly woke up out of place, but he would do anything to survive. Being strong at times when you can only rely on yourself is hard to do, but Saeng is determined by her loss and the perfection of the hibiscus flower.     

<START>

 

In the closing statement, Saeng states that "when they come back in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will retest the test." The author concludes the story with this passage because she uses the hibiscus as an example of survival. The hibiscus comes from another place like her, and she uses it to represent her well-being in the new place. In a way, she says: If the hibiscus survives this winter, so do I. I believe she uses this as a conclusion to describe her uncertain nature towards her new home.   

<START>

 

I believe the author uses it as the last paragraph because it tells about how Saeng wants to conquer and be strong even though. She misses her house. For example, Saeng believed that since she cried upon seeing the hibiscus plant, she had failed and she believed that she would get stronger over time.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the achievement and determination that Saeng gets. First, Saeng begins to be upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to look for it in a store, she is bowled over by this little reminder of her old home. This little flower made her realize how much she missed her old house and buying it becomes a necessity for her. She probably felt that with this flower, she would always have a little home in this new world. After realizing that memories are important and seeing this flower's determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the resolve to take the test again. She swears to do this because she gained faith through the survival of the flower and the making of important memories. Overall, this end paragraph reveals these specific messages         

<START>

 

The reason for which the author was inspired was because of the flower. The flower had the ability to survive harsh winters and adapt to new environments. She decides that she would overcome her obstacles just as the flower overcomes her obstacles every winter.         

<START>

 

Memory, promise, life - all are ideas that explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. The memories are a concept that helps explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because saeng misses his old life and his country. The promise is another idea because saeng vows that when spring returns, she will take the test again. The life is another idea because saeng brought the flower and planted it so she can live once spring came and she said it pass again the test. Memories, promise, and life help explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. The memories will return in the spring with the promises she made and the one who wants to start and saeng does it by planting the hibiscus which brings back many of her memories of her life                       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this statement because it was colder and all the plants and flowers were going to die.

<START>

 

Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes on the grounds that it varied before passing the test. She said to herself and swore to retest when the geese come back and the snow melts. Another reason I think the author concludes is because she missed it the first time around and that's a big thing for her and she can't wait to pass it. That's why I think the author added this to the story.    

<START>

 

In the story " Winter Hibiscus ", Saeng had failed her driving test and on her way home, she sees a flower that reminds her of what she once was at home. She buys the flower and returns to her new home to her mother who works in the garden. They decide to plant the flower in the garden, and when the flower has been planted a flock of geese fly over his head, Saeng then realizes that everything is familiar to him now, when everything was quite strange to him. She concludes the story by saying that when the geese return in the spring, she will retake the test. She says the flower will warp, which means it will bloom or grow taller, and it will have grown and will be familiar to everything by then, so it will be ready for the test when the geese are ready to return home. home and the hibiscus will be ready to bloom.      

<START>

 

The author does this because they compare themselves to the plant. The author does this because when the plant begins to bloom, the character's confidence will return. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes sense of the story.

The author concludes this story with the paragraph @ CAPS1 to emphasize the story and make it more interesting so that the reader will want the story to continue to find out what happens next.

I think this author put that last paragraph in this story to show everyone how determined she is to pass this test and how much it means for her to do it is what I think Why the author would make history

<START>

 

The author concludes the story of the paragraph with the paragraph because it shows the connection between nature and the girl. The paragraph says " ... when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take this test again " (No @ NUM1). In the spring when all these events take place. Spring is the sign of life and birth or renewal. The geese are coming back. They are "renewed" in the symbolic sense. When the snow melts, you can see the grass again, which is a sign of life. When plants bud, they are born. The character decides when nature is reborn and symbolically renewed , it will start again just like nature.

<START>

 

In the story the author included this concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know the person was speaking when they came back that they wanted to take the test again because they would do so much more beautiful so this was the first time she took it, another reason why I think the author added this concluding paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if he really got it the novel and what she was really looking for in the novel. Thus, the author first wanted to make the reader better understand the end of the book with this concluding paragraph at the end. This is the reason why I think the author added this concluding paragraph at the very end of this novel.  

<START>

 

Because they wanted to end it, so they made the ending like the first part of the story. I love the part when the birds came back they got part of the flower that came back to them.

Saeng and his mother must be determined to do their best to survive. Saeng and her mother suffered a lot and when she failed the @ CAPS1 test she was more depressed than before. The author concludes this story with this paragraph to give readers an idea of how determined it takes to adapt and survive a different place and although Saeng and his mother are far from their homeland, they still enjoy things. what they made in Vietnam, like flowers, hot peppers and bitter melons, her friends don't agree with the taste but that doesn't stop her from enjoying what she loves the most.

For example, it ends with "When they come back Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will come back and take the test again.   

<START>

 

The author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng. He would think that every season she would be in a different mood @ CAPS1 that the garden would change so mum Saeng would always be outside for every season. 

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with the paragraph because it proves how something from a memory can make someone determined. For example, saeng failed his driving test, but reaching the hibiscus plant reminded him of his old home. Plus, while she is planting the plant, she sees the geese with a new familiarity. This makes her determined to complete her test, as having two callbacks from both houses comforts her to know that she can adjust easily and cherish her memories as well.   

<START>

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because she promises to take the test again in order to pass it. She will do it when it's spring with the hibiscus budding. She must pass the test and start driving. I think it's a good thing when people swear something to each other.   

<START>

 

It refers to Saeng's way of life and what they do. And what the region looks like from a weather point of view. 

<START>

 

The author decided to end the story with this sentence to show that she will wait for it next year and do it all over again. She will wait for him and do it all over again. She will be waiting for it and will prove that she can do it one more time and that she is used to living there now.  

<START>

 

the author thus concludes this story to show a new beginning in spring. Like the way flowers bloom and bud in spring, she will become a new better person. this is why the author concludes the story thus.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will retry the test and make a fresh start. Also, I think it shows the reader that if you fail something the first time around, don't be afraid to go back and try it again. I also think the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the winter test and doesn't like what she is in. But in the spring, when the hibiscus has buds on it, she will retake the test having a new environment in which to survive.   

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it lets you interpret and decide. He doesn't come out to tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, it's up to you. It also leaves you wondering what's going to happen until then. The end of the story can be whatever you want it to be, it's up to you to interpret it. For different people, it can mean different things.      

<START>

 

The author ended the story with this paragraph because this paragraph says when she will try to take the test and make changes in her changing life. For example, she is sad in the story because she failed the test and wants to go home. If she dies in the spring, she could try to make some changes and live here. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is finally comfortable with his new " home ". After the passage mainly reflects Saeng's old life, it ends like this to signify that she has become accustomed to her new way of life. For example, it says “in the spring, and the geese come back…” which shows that she is now used to geese and the nature of her new world. The author also uses this paragraph at the end to show a sense of liberation. Saeng had so many memories locked in her old life that she couldn't capture new ones in her new home. The authors' use of this paragraph is a good way to end the story as it allows the reader to feel the relaxed scene of the flying birds; Saeng escapes his pain and becomes a real part of his new world.               

<START>

 

This last paragraph reveals something special to the reader. Saeng received new hope for understanding winter mothers and the hibiscus plant. She felt hopeless, miserable and incomparable when she saw the hibiscus which reminded her of her homeland. When she got home, however, seeing the roots of the plant buried in the ground gave her new determination. The flower represents her. He adapted to be able to survive in cold weather or in rough weather, in Saeng's case. The roots are his past and although they are buried, they are not forgotten. The actual flower represents new life for Saeng in a new land. The author, Minfong Ho, has personified or humanized non-living things in the story. That's why the author used the last paragraph and then why she did.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to show Saeng's determination. It also links the conductor test to the hibiscus plant. It means that when everything else begins to come to life, she will accomplish something as well. She needs the motivation of her environment to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by his surroundings. For example, when she is in the greenhouse, it brings her back to her childhood: “It was like stepping into another world. A very hot and very green world which explodes with greenery ... Plants that she had not even realized that she knew but that she had forgotten brought her back to the world of her childhood.      

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", Saeng finds solace in the plant after failing his test. The plant reminds her of her home and connects it to her past experiences. Even though she failed the test the first time around, she feels that if she studies and tries again, she can pass. This connects with Hibiscus because in winter the plant dies but in spring it looks pretty and blooms again. Saeng feels a connection to the rebirth of plants and thinks she can start over and pass the test. This is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng promises to take the test again when spring comes and the hibiscus blooms.     

<START>

 

The @ CAPS1 why the author concludes the story by saying, "When they come back Saeng silently swore to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this bibiscus is budding, so I will take this test again. " The author ended it like this, because Saeng is basically saying that the time will come for her to take this test and that she will pass it with confidence in herself,   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to say that in due course she will pass the test she failed, convinced that the hibiscus will help her overcome obstacles. I believe she bought the plant when she failed the test, that she hopes that with the plant flowering, I will give her a schedule as to when she is ready to try again. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events of the story. Everything that happened to Saeng while she was at florizd comes down to something that looks like revenge. The reason Saeng was sad in the first place was because she had failed her driving test. In the last paragraph, she vows to retest when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus purchased by Saeng will begin to bud in the spring when the snow melts. The last paragraph of the story gives Saeng time to face his nostalgia for the winter season. Finally, the geese flying south make Saeng sad, but they kindle a spark in her. She thinks to herself that she will retake the driver's license when the geese come back, when the hibiscus buds and when the snows melt.                      

<START>

 

In the last paragraph, they try to express what is coming. At the end of winter, spring will come, which means the hibiscus will return and it will be right at home. The geese will also come back and because of this she will take the quiz again. For her, it's like starting all over again and I hope she succeeds. Plus, she loves the hibiscus and the couture which is back, maybe she will do a lot better. All in all, a new hour is coming.      

<START>

 

I think the author of "Winter Hibiscus" finished with "when they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, so I'll take that test again, "Because it shows us the importance of the plant and how it will help it be successful. It also symbolizes that when the plant is budding and fighting all obstacles to survive, it will overcome the obstacles to pass its driving test. For example, in the story it is written "When the snows melt and the geese return", the author tells this to Saeng and his struggle to pass his test with these struggles to survive the winter. He also says “Like geese. She lifted her head and watched their distinctive I burn into the evening sky, slowly seeing in the distance ”. This quote says she will rise to her challenge and overcome it. All in all, this quote "when they come back Saeng silently swore to himself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus holds, then I will take this test again", because it shows the same struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and complete what has started.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes sense. The author says that when these animals and living creatures have their chance, she too will have her chance. For example, the geese will be able to come back, the hibiscus will have the chance to bud and she will have the chance to pass her driving test. I know this because Saeng's mother starts talking about the beauty of the plant in the spring. She even says, "But it's strong enough to get through the cold months." This indicates that the mother is trying to tell him that she will have a second chance. This is why the story ends with this sentence.      

<START>

 

Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it tells about the seasons and how they change and how they come and go and they start with a new season, then it's something different. And I think that's why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus because after spring is winter and when it was spring they have all the beautiful flowers that smell great. And when spring has passed into winter, all the plants are dead, they will not be the same as before.

In "Winter Hibiscus", by @ CAPS1 Ho, Saeng doesn't give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph which has extraordinary significance. "... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again", saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a chance, and to remember still from his homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way as it reinforces the theme. There is a lot to be learned in just a few words.    

<START>

 

The author chose to end the story with the last paragraph for several reasons. Saeng says she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new beginning or a new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later Saeng has another chance to pass his test and also get the most out of being at @ LOCATION1 and adjusting to his new life. When she buys hibiscus, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give him hope, and the last paragraph of the story mentions hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give him hope to pass his test and also to adapt to @ LOCATION1 while remembering his old home in Vietnam.      

<START>

 

The author ends the sentence at the end to indicate that when the plants start to grow again and the geese come back, she will try again. For example, the plants have to push their pedals back and the geese have to settle down and find food again. The author says she will retake the test when the geese come back and the plants grow back.  

<START>

 

The author wrote the paragraph because she came inside the house for dinner and because she will not see the garden until the other day and because winter is coming and she will not be playing anymore. outside before winter. As she said "In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again." This quote explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.  

<START>

 

I have to say the reason the narrator is done with this is because it's kind of a fix if you think about it. And you don't put the solution somewhere other than the end, which is why she put it there. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this author's paragraph shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she has found a hobby to look to the future as well. Canada geese flew by ”, which is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

<START>

 

The author ended the story with this specific quote because it shows understanding of the beauty and wonders of nature. Saeng spent a lot of money to buy a separate flower called dok faeng-nol. Saeng passed a driver's license but failed, and during her exam she found this plant. Ashamed of having failed the test, she still showed her mother the flower she found, which was not like the one in the house. Her mother is happy with the flowers and understands that Saeng failed her test. Her mother said of the flower, "Her flowers aren't that pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the cold months here, that winter hibiscus." What matters was a figurative speech that there was hope for Saeng to pass her test again when she learned more refinement and was ready to try again. And with geese flying away for the winter and returning in the spring, that means a new start to success.       

<START>

 

The author concludes this way because when it is hot and sunny outside, they will take the test again because it is now nostalgic outside.

<START>

 

This is actually a very powerful last statement, even though she failed her driving test she realized that she will just have to stay strong and be patient. Soon the geese will return and the snow will melt, and she will "come back" to take her test and be determined to pass. Saeng bought the hibiscus to feel like she was back in Vietnam, and felt like he could fill that place in her heart if he missed it. "I paid it nineteen dollars ." She says it as if she is disappointed that she failed the test, but also that saying that is free in Vietnam was so expensive in the United States. A hibiscus flower is tropical, so when it blooms in the spring, it will be ready to retry the test.                      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this ending because it shows that if the plant comes back and flowers, it will come back and do the test and try to pass this time. She knows it is going to be difficult for her to come back and pass this test, but she knows she can do it just as she knows the plant will fight through the winter and come back and flower in the spring. This gives it confidence that it can pass this test if the plant can get through the harsh winter it is going through. Accordingly, this is why the author ended the story with this.   

<START>

 

In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the driving test because not only will she take the driving test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The test for the pilots is not the main problem, it is the adaptation to his new environment that hurts Saeng so much. For example, in the @ NUM1 lines, Saeng's thought is "Such a deep and strong wave of loss has struck Saeng's eyes now and swept her" and "into the hot and humid shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng braked and cried. “ It shows that Saeng is struggling to readjust to her new life and reminds her of her old memories of where she lived and cries because it's gone. I think the failure of her driving test was just a little thing that finally made her cry from the stress, and when she said "and this hibiscus is budding, I will iron this again. test." This means that she will overcome all of this and move on.         

<START>

 

It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved hibiscus, so when spring arrives and the hibiscus blooms, this would be the best time to retake this test after having already failed. It would probably make her more confident that she would retake the driving test at the right time. So in conclusion, this is why the author concludes this paragraph from the story     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this because she says she will grow up with the change of seasons. She's in a new country and just failed her driving test. She feels depressed but the hibiscus reminds her of coming home. In @ CAPS1's story, mother said "I saw this genus blooming along the lake, it is strong enough to get through the winter. I think Saeng can relate to this because if the flower can do it in winter, she can do it in a new country.

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the author ends the story with this last paragraph, "When they return Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus builds itself, so I'm going to do this test again. The author ends the story with this paragraph because at first Saeng bought a hibiscus plant because it reminded him of his hometown in his childhood world. ") So she bought it, but since the weather was bad at the time, Saeng had to bring the plant back in time and plant it in the garden. But she failed to put it on time. That's why says "I'll take this test again". And she will take it up again in the spring when the hibiscus blooms again. That is why the author ended the story with this paragraph.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the paragraph like this because it shows that she @ MONTH1 is not going to give up. I @ MOIS1 this because she silently swore to herself that she was going to retake the test again in the spring, too, it was them not the earnings in the old seed years an ezing.

She misses her house so she is in pain and the only thing that comforts her a little are the flowers. For example, the girl says, "This is not a real ... I mean, not like the kind we had at ...", here she stops because she is so upset that she can not say at home. the flower she has right now is not real, but when the real one blooms in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her confidence to take the test again.

The author's conclusion explains his feelings. The author's conclusion tells me "when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again", which means she is female. For example, taking the test means she is going to change. It also means that she is ready for new things. For example, the test for her is to prepare to take on something new. This is what I got from the conclusion. 

<START>

 

The author ends with this paragraph to show that Saeng had. Hope. This shows that there is still hope. The end paragraph sort of makes you create your own ending for Saeng. I like to imagine Saeng with a big garden next to her and she passes the test.      

<START>

 

I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. This last paragraph brings together and unites the whole last paragraph on the idea of conclusion. He tells us that in the spring, when everything comes back to life, Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in the last paragraph show how Saeng and his mother have adjusted and new things start in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text, it is written: “ I know, ” said his mother softly. “ I saw this genus blooming along the lake. winter hibiscus. It means and represents that although life is different here away from the Saengs, they will adapt and survive in their own way.

The author concludes the story as she does because it shows that Saeng must heal from the failed test before he can take it again. Saeng already knows she can heal. She realizes that she has grown used to where she lives now, that things in her new country, like the song of geese, are now "familiar" to her. The narrator of the story says: "... she realized that a lot of things that she once considered strange had become ... almost familiar to her now." Things in Saeng's new home had been strange to her at first, but she had healed and got used to it. Saeng also recovered after leaving his home country, Vietnam. She was sad to leave her home, "A work so deep and so hard that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept her away.", But she was healed. Saeng remembers the flowers she had known in Vietnam as " old friends ", showing that it didn't hurt to remember them. When Saeng recovers from a failure on her driving test, as she had cured when she moved from Vietnam to the United States, she can take the test again, painlessly.                               

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character, Saeng, would adjust to his new home and stay strong. I believe when Saeng's mother says, "Her flowers are not so pretty, but they are strong enough to get through the cold months here, that winter hibiscus," I think Saeng's mother also thinks in some way. kind to Saeng It's almost also if she says the move here marked Saeng but that she will be strong and survive the change, like anyone who failed a test she will study more and try to pass it next time around. Saeng wo n't give up and she will keep hanging on to get through Saeng knows it is difficult to adapt to life's changes, but with a little courage and hard work it will be a snap. If she believes in herself, she will be able to settle in this new place.     

<START>

 

when they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds then I will take this test again. It is there for many reasons. The first is that when winter comes and brings all the snow, it kills its garden. That's why she wants it to be spring again so that she can start growing things in her garden again. She had to do a test on the things she grows to make sure it's @ CAPS1 for someone to eat it. That's why I think the paragraph "when the return, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again."     

<START>

 

In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take the test again" (@ NUM1). This shows that the girl is adjusting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reason the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the young girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to become stronger over time. She says when the hibiscus returns she will be ready to take the test again and not fail.    

<START>

 

The Hibiscus is budding means the flower was growing. It is a flower with a lot of bright colors and nothing else can beat it. The reason another flower can't beat it is because this flower stands for so many things and it is one of the most natural born flowers there is.

People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the region. However, as you adjust to a new area, you also need to remember your old home. This is what Minfong Ho tries to display in the last paragraph of the story, "Winter Hibiscus". In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to @ LOCATION2 She has various memories of her past at home while visiting a factory store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says "In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test drive again." This shows Saeng's desire to fit into this culture, passing the driver's license, as well as remembering his past, keeping the flower. This last paragraph sums up Saeng's emotion for his old country as well as his determination to succeed here.   

<START>

 

Because she promised herself that when spring returns, she will take the driving test again.

The author concludes with this paragraph to show his determination. When she says. " ... when the snow melts and the geese come back and her hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again." " Saeng explains how geese have the determination to go back and the hibiscus determining bud again, why would she not the determination and confidence to retest. Saeng said, "I failed the test." It seems her failure to obtain a driver's license made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country. But after seeing the determination of geese and hibiscus under difficult conditions, she was determined to try the test again.        

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph to explain how she already passed the test and it is now winter, she will retest the test when all the flowers and plants come back to life and start over. Saeng wants to take the test again to show her mother that she can pass it, she bought a plant called. dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars to help her mother not be disappointed. However, the mother was disappointed that she spent so much money on a plant.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things of her house and her accommodation, it will comfort her in what she is doing. The author seems to need things from his homeland that will help him make the most of things and bring back fond memories from his previous life. I think whenever I want to do a good job it helps me to think about the good things that mean a lot to me so I will be happy and want to do good. The author is smart to want to see these things so that she resumes her test because if she sees her plant doing well and will see the memory of the geese again, it will be lucky for her.     

<START>

 

The author chooses to end the story with a paragraph like this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from his memories and the newly familiar things in his new home. The combination of the failed driving test and being away from his original home caused Saeng a great loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, " aware of a loss so deep and so strong that it stung Saeng's eyes has now swept it away." “In the rest of the story, Saeng is still down and the reader is unsure if she will be okay. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. ” The bitter melon tang is gone and her Saeng's mouth made his mouth water "," The winter hibiscus was now in the ground ", and" above a herd of Canada geese flew, their weak clear horns and - yes - familiar to Saeng now. This awareness that geese are familiar to her gives way to a new awareness and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now familiarizing herself with many things about her new stone which she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the last paragraph explains to the reader. It sums up Saeng's new hope that she will learn not only to live in her new home, but to herself. flourish there.               

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this statement because it shows that for her the hibiscus symbolizes the overcoming of obstacles. This symbolizes this because she says " ... and the geese come back and it is budding, I will take this test again " (Ho @ NUM1). This shows that even though she failed this time around, when the hibiscus grows larger, she will retake the test, it shows ??? or overcome obstacles. I also believe that it symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it "gives him the strength of his old country". This shows that he symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it will help him overcome this ordeal. He will do this by giving her strength or by comforting her. From here you can tell that the author ends the story with this statement. ??? ...

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. In the story, there are a few quotes to support my answer “ I failed the test, ” Saeng said.

The last paragraph of the story. Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is important to the story. The last paragraph leaves a definite ending so the reader will know exactly what is going to happen in the future. This paragraph is a very important ending to the story because it represents the symbols of the story. The author concludes that the hibiscus is important to her. Along with the hibiscus, he also shows that geese and snowmelt represent a new beginning and a new beginning. These symbols are important to her because they give her a chance to start over and she sees him in the winter hibiscus .

Saeng was very distracted knowing that she had failed the test and to her she felt like it was a disappointment or a disappointment. This sentence shows Saeng's ambition and determination to succeed in this ordeal.

The author concludes the story with When They Return… "to show how Saeng has changed throughout the storyline. At first, she refers to her new home as" entering another world . " As a teenager, she had to leave Vietnam where traditions are so different than in the US However, there is a similar plant, the winter hibiscus. The plant connects her previous life and home with life and life. the house she lives in now. It was difficult to adjust to the moving situation, but the plant created the familiar scents and the “ familiar scent ” that “ filled her lungs .” It was even difficult for saeng to pronounce the words "home" without breaking down in tears. Once the Winter Hibiscus was in the ground it changed saeng and she realized that she needed to enjoy what she had. in conclusion, the author finished the story with this paragraph because it showed how the plant re Seemed like saeng and how altered his mind was.               

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this sentence as a way to show how Saeng adopts his new home, while still valuing his old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will retake his test in the spring, showing his persistence. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng gets to know his new country. She says, “ when the snows melt and the geese come back ”, it is important because the geese and the snow are now at home, and she accepts them now. However, Saeng also says, “when this hibiscus is budding,” and it shows how Saeng still thinks about his old home, as the plant is his link to memories of Vietnam. Therefore, I feel like the author shows how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in his life by ending the story with this statement.              

<START>

 

I think the author says up to date is that when it is winter the hibiscus is trying to replenish the cold. While the plants just have to die, the hibiscus has to face it head-on             

<START>

 

I think the author includes this because she doesn't want to let her audience guess what would happen next. Then "I'll take the test again." This quote says that she @ MONTH1 failed the test with the plant but will never give up and when spring comes she will try again. I feel like the author added this to better understand what it feels like to leave your homeland to come to a place you don't understand or understand, like the flower situation in the story. When she thought of plants and their scent, it gave her the old feelings she had for her homeland and how close she was to her grandmother. She was so used to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having room to grow. Seeing all of this, Saeng collapsed and cried. In conclusion, I feel like the author added the paragraph at the end to understand and folks, so not let Saeng @ MOIS1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up this test until she feels she has passed it.

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" intentionally inserted this last paragraph. Honestly, the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph, when it says, "In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again." @ CAPS1 @ NUM1. When the author writes down all these things in the wild that are going to happen, it symbolizes rebirth and a new beginning, new luck and that's what Saeng needs with his driver's license. The author put powerfully. Put these symbols in there to show the girl hope to get through this difficult time. Finally, the story has an impression of roundness and ends with this last paragraph, the story is over.       

<START>

 

The reason I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it was a good learning story, you can learn something from it. The author did this so that you can better understand the story. It was written "A Saeng teenage girl and her family moved to the United States from Vietnam". So reading this tells me it tells you what happened right before the story took place. So you will be able to understand better. For me, it's all rapping for you. That's why I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph.       

<START>

 

I believe that the author of "Winter Hibiscus" ends the story as she did because saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to do the test when the snow melts, the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. In other words, when spring comes, she will be ready for the test. Saeng states in the story " The flowers aren't quite that pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the cold months here, those winter hibiscus. That's what matters. " I think Saeng has been using this as a guide since she just moved from Vietnam. She is considering making it and using the plant as a symbol. She will attempt her driver's license again at the early spring.         

<START>

 

The author used "when they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again" because it sounds like his mother is refreshing, wake up and recover. And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that happened. She was really sad that she had failed. work outlining what Saeng is going to do. She will see the bright side and eat to come back and pass the test

<START>

 

I am the narrator of this story paragraph because hibiscus is a precious plant and the garden is your own decision if you like to grow things like its mother grows chili. The garden is a different way of @ CAPS1, like the different kinds of food you can plant and the different plants in the world, for example @ CAPS2, lilies and other plants like that. 

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. The failure of the test drive was a setback for Saeng, so she is considering taking it again. She plans to use hibiscus as a motivation, because winter for hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle.  

<START>

 

The reason I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because I think it shows how much it means to her and shows that she really cares. And by showing that she cares, she'll take the test again.

<START>

 

She ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to let everyone know that she feels more comfortable in the spring. He also indicates that she can't wait for geese and hibiscus to start budding as it is her favorite time of year. 

<START>

 

Saeng is uncomfortable with her regrets and has not adapted to the changes from which she moved. She finds the hibiscus and chooses to go buy it, as it reminds her of her house at @ LOCATION2. When she brings it home, her mother initially seems shocked at the price saeng paid, but then becomes more sympathetic when she realizes that @ LOCATION2 is missing her. Sheang says she will be retaking her test in the spring. She is also hinting that she is going to change her attitude about life at @ LOCATION1.      

<START>

 

I think the author concludes this in the story because he says when the geese come back.

<START>

 

The author concludes this because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to a place where she didn't like and didn't know anyone. The author is trying to tell us anyway don't give up, have faith. In the end, Saeng is confident in herself and can pass the test next time. She @ MOIS1 realized that just because you are not at home doesn't mean you can't continue.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story like this to give the reader the idea that you can't just stop if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes, I will come back and take the test again, it shows that she will not stop and life will go on. That's why I think the author chose to end the story like this.  

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she doesn't want to give up battling her homesickness. The first time she bought this plant it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed her there. Telling Shell to take the test again shows that she doesn't want to let her defeat her in her new home and new life.  

<START>

 

The author concludes saeng's vow in the story to show that saeng can and has the ability to overcome obstacles. Saeng feels like a failure. Her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her failed driving test. Geese represent survival and never give up, to keep doing your best to be successful.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will bloom, Saeng will retake the test, the two will receive a fresh start. Ending the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but with a lot of meaning. " ... and this hibiscus is budding, so I'll take this test again." " I think the last sentence is almost inspiring and makes you want to start fresh as Saeng.      

<START>

 

The author ends the story with "When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will do this test again" For many good reasons. Some reasons are that she will continue to move forward and adjust to her new life in Canada. She will change her lifestyle and try to adapt to her new culture. She will also have to relive the memory of her grandmother and wants to manage it better. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eye has now swept it away.” She wants to be able to handle the loss better. The author wishes to stress that the story is not yet over.              

<START>

 

There are several reasons why the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One of the reasons it's the onset of winter, so the hibiscus won't come back until spring. Also, it's the end of the story so it's a good way to end it because it's the end of the hibiscus and the end of the story. The last paragraph also sort of sums up the story and it's short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It's not like most endings in a story, so it's unique. Because most of the stories are not about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons why the narrator might have chosen to end the story with this paragraph.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with his paragraph to show how people can regain their resolve. At the start of the story, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. When she sees the Hibiscus, she is filled with memories of the past and cries. Her mother's kindness prompts Saeng to draw her strength from the flower, which, as her mother puts it, is " strong enough to get through the cold months here ." @ CAPS1 that the Hibiscus will bud in the spring, Saeng renews his determination to pass the test.      

<START>

 

The author ends with this answer because he is trying to say that Saeng will repeat himself but this time more useful in the garden and his mother. Try more with her schoolwork and less with your gardening focus.  

<START>

 

Saeng's personality in this story shows determination and confidence. I think she thinks she could do more experienced things on different plants. I also think it's the perfect hobby experience for someone who loves plants. I think Saeng @ MONTH1 has achieved his planting goals. I think she @ MONTH1 wants to continue her career in gardening. When she said when the plants returned she would take the test again. I think she means this, she's ready to explore more plants. I think she @ MOIS1 had this planting experience from her mother. For me, this @ MONTH1 has been a family tradition. Saeng will likely have children and teach them the different types of flowers.         

<START>

 

The author ended the story with the paragraph in order to show that Saeng is looking forward to his life and with a positive attitude. This shows that she will no longer be depressed by the change in her life. The hibiscus is used as a device for the plot of this story. When changes occur with hibiscus, changes occur in history. At first, Saeng is without hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees him, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she's planning it out, things start to improve. She begins to embrace the change when the last paragraph says, "When they come back ... and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again", it shows that Saeng is looking at her future with a positive eye, and with this positive change, the hibiscus is now starting to bloom. The author concludes the story in a symbolic way that helps express the themes of the story.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph "Saeng silently swore to herself" because she wants to do Saeng at the right time and in the right season. " Winter season ", the earth or the ground was so cold that the plants could not grow properly. " Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars, " and she Saeng failed the test. “There was a frail and stiff beauty in her mother Saeng that touched Saeng deeply,” her mother Saeng shines when she works on plants. These are all the description that concludes in the past who wants to make the correction and shine like his mother and also pass the test.         

<START>

 

At the end of the short "Winter Hibiscus" start, Saeng says "when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that test again." When she says this she is referring to her driving test, she says she will take the test again because she is reminded that her family did not give up, they moved to @ LOCATION1 for a fresh start "a plant that she had forgotten brought her back to her childhood world. ”She sees these flowers after failing, which reminds her that she has never given up before. 

<START>

 

The author tries to convey a sense of hope to Saeng in his new country. After noting that she failed her test, which is likely a citizenship test, the author wants to end the story with something to reassure the reader. Obviously this test was important because Saeng couldn't even look his mother in the eye. This is probably why she bought the flower for her mother. The ending reassures the reader so that you don't wonder how this will work out for Saeng.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because to tell us that she will try to find this flower to bring back memories of her old home. To show us that they will come back, he will survive even though that's not where she wanted him to come from . In the story it says " I failed the test " meaning that Saeng had bought the hibiscus which was real or what she thought was not what she wanted to be. In the last paragraph, she says she will take this test again. To say that she will find the winter hibiscus is how it was in the homeland. She hopes they survive and hopes she will find a flower like this because in this last paragraph it says "saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus bud, so I'll take that test again, ”meaning she hopes and prays to find one like her old homeland.                  

<START>

 

The author was trying to finish the story quickly, which is why he ended it with this one.

<START>

 

When spring comes and all the snow melts, she will plant new seeds. The author concludes this because she did not pass the test well the first time. But next year, she will work with her plants and then take the test again to pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he doesn't want people to think she is just worried about plants.   

<START>

 

In the story, "Winter Hibiscus" is about this girl named Saeng, her mother and her grandmother. Flowers are beautiful to them, they plant them all day. By choosing them, @ CAPS1 them. "Saeng didn't dare look his mother in the eye"      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she confided in herself because she did not pass the test, she could take it again and knows that she can pass the test that 'she put up about it her mom when she talks to her made her feel good and agreed to take or retake the test and know she could pass the test, that's why I think the author concludes it with this saying at the end of the story.

<START>

 

This paragraph means that when the winter is over and the geese come back from the south, and her favorite plant returns to her old country, she will try what she tried to do before, but this time she is more confident. . That's what I think it means. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sums it all up and resolves the conflict of his failing his driving test. When Saeng said "… I will take this test again" it showed that she was determined to pass the tests and that she would try again. Since the conflict is resolved there, you pretty much have to introduce a new conflict to keep the story going for the author to end it. This excerpt from the last paragraph also hardly incorporates Saeng into these geese, because just like geese have difficulty in obtaining their driver's license. But also like geese, she will face trials again.    

<START>

 

In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author ends the story in a well mannered manner. The author ended with this paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to persuade even if he was away from home. She's on a downward spiral early in the story, she failed a test, and the hibiscus is testing her sense of longing. When she got home, her mother greeted her with kind words acting as an anti-depressant by making her eat peppers and bitter melons. This made Saeng see the good in life, which made her not give up and be convinced that she would pass the test.    

<START>

 

Well in the story, Saeng fails his driving test. When she returns home, she sees a familiar plant, she then goes to a florist and finds that the plant is called a hibiscus. She then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and her childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother whom she left behind, so now she is connected to the plant. She also sees geese flying overhead heading south for the winter, so she says "When they come back", so she means when the geese are flying north for @ DATE1. And when "the snow melts" then when it gets warmer and spring begins. When "this hibiscus is budding", so when spring comes and the plant starts to flower, she is going to "do that test again" then she says she will take the pipe test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to train and prepare for the test. She swears to herself that in the spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass.         

<START>

 

She said it also shows the determination it takes to get there, no matter how many times you fail you have to get up and try again. She shows her courage this way too, it takes a lot for someone to fail something and get up and try again. She is unwilling to accept failure, and she is trying to redeem her failure so she says she will try again. That's why she ended the story this way.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author has done this so that people reading the story will know what it is going to do next spring and they can make it another story so you know it will pass the test in the spring. . 

<START>

 

In the story of winter hibiscus, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when winter comes and the plant she loves disappears and the flower brought her luck, she said " when the snow melts in the spring and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that test again. The flower was very important to her. She said, "That rich, sweet scent that was familiar too. She was talking about the smell of flowers compared to her grandmother's shell, it was the same.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story this way because she's going to come back and do the same thing next year.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this because she wants to take the test again. Because she wants to take the test for her mother. So she brought the flower home to apologize to her mother.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because everything in the story will repeat itself like the seasons change and you will not be able to plant or cultivate in winter. For example, she explained that plants are nothing like her house, but that she has to adapt to the fact that she is not at home and adapt to her surroundings. I say this because if she doesn't, it will just be an unhappy person who will worry about where she came from.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the answer by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus buds, it will retest. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl has just moved out of her house and feels horribly lonely and depressed because she wants to go home. She is nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a cozy feeling as if she were at home. When she says, "In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that test again." I think she says this because she is upset that she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort that gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in the spring.        

<START>

 

when they come back Saeng silently swore In the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding then I will take this test again

<START>

 

In @ PERSON1's "@ CAPS1 Hibiscus", the author chose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, hope, and portrayal of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depressed mood as she failed the driving test so she is very upset. Her memories of her old country start to come back to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. "And in the hot and humid shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng collapsed and cried." He misses Vietnam a lot and seeing this plant in this store gives him flashbacks. Winter begins to give her the feeling that all hope is lost. "Almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of things she once considered strange before had become, thanks to the silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar now." For her, weird things start to feel the same year after year, no new hope, nothing new, just the same old thing day after day. This plant is really starting to tear her up outright from the performance. "She found that she was still too shaky to say the word at home, lest she tear herself apart again." She cannot say home because the home is not hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of eminence emotions that all have to deal with his safe past. The last paragraph is more revealing of how, when her hope returns in the spring, she will try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph, which is why it fits when it does.            

<START>

 

It was a very interesting story and it snowed all the hardships this young girl went through, the author finished it in a very interesting way. When they finished the story, I thought to myself how well it ended. If think the author did a really good job. She made all the hard ships Saeng had been through to snow, as if it was the harsh winter. Then, as the author said, “ like the snow melts ;… ”, I think this shows how, even though Saeng's problems seem endless and difficult, one day they will go away and things will be beautiful again, like the flower bud. In spring. Plus she did a great job because throughout the story I could feel her pain. I felt like I was there with her because of her use of descriptive words like “ explode, shock, intense ” and others to describe how sudden everything was. Then when she finished it, it was like showing us Saeng's hope for a better future, even though things aren't how they were at home!                      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph - “When they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will retest the test.” (@ NUM1) because she thinks that when the hibiscus blooms, she can also flower by passing the test. Saeng also relates to the hibiscus. "Her flower is not quite so pretty, but it's strong enough to pass here, this winter hibiscus." (@ NUM1) Her mom is trying to tell her that she can be strong too. She too can get through the cold months. "Like the geese, she lifted her head and watched their distinctive V shape against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance." (@ NUM1) Much like the geese, Saeng realizes that she is proud of herself and that there will be other chances. Don't always doubt yourself because there will be other chances. Don't be afraid to try again.         

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it means that she will return there after the winter to take care of it. The author puts this in the end paragraph because it says how much she cares about this plant because she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that's the reason she takes care of it so well that she will have something with her to remind her of her home.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph on geese because it shows how Saeng, like geese, will adapt to his new environment. This shows that she will do what needs to be done to survive, just as geese must. She will retake the test and not give up. The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, "… she noticed the tears on her daughter's cheeks and her swollen eyes" [No]. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and doesn't like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as mentioned in the last paragraph. Further, the narration states, "... she admitted she far preferred him to a Big Mac" [Ho]. This proves that even though she @ MOIS1 doesn't like things sometimes, Saeng is ready to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, " ... she realized that a lot of the things she considered strange before had become familiar to her now. " [@ NUM1]. Saeng is getting more and more used to her surroundings and adapts to it, just like geese adapts, which is why the author ended the story with the paragraph on geese.           

<START>

 

The reason the author wrote the concluding paragraph was to show that Saeng envisions a better future.

Just like the flower, it keeps coming back after going through all that is tuff. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a reason. The hibiscus reminds him of Vietnam. Geese remind him of his home now. These two things make her strong.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant was not budding and the geese leave and then see the test fail because all this made her sad. But when the snow melts, the geese come back and the plant begins to bud, it will be happy again and it will take the test again and it will pass because it is happy. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One of the reasons is to show that Saeng won't give up and will keep trying to pass his test. Another way is to show that even though your life has changed, that doesn't mean you have to give up. It's a part of how the author concludes the story as he does it.   

<START>

 

I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they wanted to show that she is attached to her nature, especially the hibiscus. She thought hibiscus was special because of what she made of it. Like when they said "she reached out and gently touched the petals." It was smooth and cool, with a hint of velet towards the center ”. And that's why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.     

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng thinks it will be a good time to take his driving test again and when the hibiscus is budding. And another reason would be that the authors want to show his determination, 

<START>

 

She swore this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after failing it, but she waits for the plant to pass and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so he spends the winter and he will pass the test and then Saeng can pass too because she knows that a tropick plant could have survived a harsh winter so she can survive / pass test it next spring. 

<START>

 

Why I think the author concludes the last paragraph of the story because it's kind of like a moral to the story. She is trying to say that when the time is right, she will try again until she is successful. Without this last paragraph, you would not be able to understand the message of the story.  

<START>

 

Saeng is a very helpful young lady for her mother, she does things the author did as the end line to make the story more interesting for reading and to keep thom hanging on until the end

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to explain to you that it will start again when the hibiscus is back.

<START>

 

Guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she's in confetti around the flowers, plants and greens

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he says when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means when she gets old and gains confidence then it will bloom and pass the test when it is ready, just as the hibiscus will be ready to start budding again.

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph because it is about flowers and nature. Then come the seasons when flowers do not grow like winter for example. The paragraph says that in the spring, when winter is over, she thinks to herself that she will be eager to see all the plants that nature has to offer.       

<START>

 

I believe he used that as an ending to make sure she was strong and would do whatever it took to persevere.

<START>

 

The author includes this sentence in the paragraph because it is the beginning of a new beginning.                             

<START>

 

In the story, the author concludes with "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself" in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again. I think she did that to say you shouldn't give up. In the story, Saeng goes to the store and "touches a petal." She buys the plant in an attempt to remember her old home. This way, it looks like Saeng is ready to let go of his memories of his past. When she brings the plant home and she and her mom are planting it in the garden. I think Saeng is trying to make his new home like his old one.      

<START>

 

Author Minfong Ho concludes the story with Saeng promising to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts and the hibiscus buds. This is done to symbolize the many things Saeng has learned. For example, she has learned that she has to adapt to changes in her life and learn new things. The geese and the snow she admits are the things that were "strange before [and] had become familiar to her now." The hibiscus also stands for something and has a reason to be included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past and comfort when needed. The last paragraph symbolizes a lot of things, and if you examine it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learned.      

<START>

 

The author ends the story with Saeng swearing to himself the relationship between passing the driving test and the importance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things were for her in Vietnam. For example, the hibiscus in @ LOCATION3 was "Madagascar periwinkle" in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surroundings when taken from another country in accordance with Saeng's adaptation to life in @ LOCATION3. The reason she said that in the spring she would take the test again symbolizes this connection between the flower and the way she lives now. For example, her ability and determination to overcome obstacles when this flower blooms. Another is a connection to his past experiences. And it was a sense of comfort to her after failing her driving test. The author has linked the meaning of the flower to the end of the story showing the hope and dedication towards Saeng and the obstacles she overcomes to get to where she is today.        

<START>

 

The reason I think the author ended the story like this is because she's always going to start over. For moments in the story, she said that I had failed the test. From what she knew she was going to give up. That's why I believe he ended the story with this line   

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he is trying to say that Saeng is going to start all over again like hibiscus would. Even if you are going through some difficult times in your life, take a step and repeat until it improves. The author also concluded the story with this paragraph because the paragraph starts the story pretty much over the same way Saeng would.   

<START>

 

She wants to say that when she comes back, she will do the same thing again and see if she will do better or not.

<START>

 

Saeng silently swore to himself "in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again" because his mind has drifted away from the thought of a flower. She said, "One of the flowers had fallen," then carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. luckily he distracted his mind. His tail reaction promise was silent for a long time and said nothing. She never got angry. All she did was wipe the shards of green off Saeng's hands. His mother mainly thought of the plants throughout the day, Saeng dug a hole and carefully lowered the "winter hibiscus" into it. goat retaking the driving test as she got used to her new car. The introduction says "Saeng, a teenage girl and her family left Vietnam for the United States. He never mentioned his family."       

<START>

 

The author has included this paragraph to show how much he misses Vietnam. When the girl saw the hibiscus, it brought back memories of Vietnam. Seeing the hibiscus allows her to find solace. The paragraph is therefore there to show how the United States is different from Vietnam. As the United States has changing seasons, it allows the girl to get used to the United States. The factory will still be there, but it must seek the good that the United States offers. The author says: "Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she once considered strange had become, thanks to the silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar now." This quote shows how the girl got used to the United States. How she will always remember Vietnam and find things in the United States that remind her of Vietnam. In conclusion, the paragraph is used to show how much the girl regretted Vietnam, but how she finds solace in the United States.         

<START>

 

These basically say he'll be there again, just like geese always come back.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One being that she is still uncomfortable talking about her old home "She was still having the words spoken at home" [HO] so the snowmelt the geese come back, and the hibiscus budding. Second, remind him of his home. We know this because Saeng says "Just like she knew it would feel ..." Back home, it just grows wild right next to cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. '' [HO]. So with a reminder of her home she is giving both comfort and confidence. The author therefore concludes with this paragraph because since the geese, the hibiscus and the melting snow remind her of her home, it is then that she will pass the test again, when she is confident and strong.          

<START>

 

Adding this paragraph at the end of the story shows that a resolution has been made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test she was unhappy and heartbroken however, after purchasing the hibiscus she had regained hope and motivation and decided, in the end, that she would retake the test, "in the spring, when the snow will melt, and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding. ” This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. Its to help move the story to a conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this. Readers can understand the message as the story of paragraphs like this. In this case, the author's message was never to drop arms and people find their motivation in simple things.It is important to know what an author is trying to say to the reader through paragraphs not only as the reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express cla irely his ideas to an audience.       

<START>

 

I think the author uses this quote, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, then I will take the test again ." @ CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and new hope. "But where did the thought of the house come from?" The hibiscus hedge? Like his sweet grandmother? "BOAT RIDE in the night and it was gone." @ CAPS2 from Vietnam to @ LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like abundance, then the next, she's in a foreign land unlike her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to switch to @ CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, the flowers will come the birds will come. It's a chance to let go. The ending quote has been said to bring her hope and love and she somehow promises herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to overcome more easily and everything is bearable.               

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. In spring, the hibiscus grows like the Saeng. When Saeng arrived at the new place, she was small and populous like the plant. "Its leaves tremble in the wind" (@ NUM1). This quote tells us that the plant was weak in peuney. If the plant was strong, it would not shake. The fact that Saeng broke down and bought the plant tells us that it wasn't.And in the end, the author uses this paragraph to tell the reader that the hibiscus is strong, just like Saeng and that he can overcome anything.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng isn't giving up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says "Not like the kind we had @ NUM1]. Saeng is very attached to her old house and wants hibiscus like she and her grandmother had. Because Saeng wouldn't bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states: "... and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @ NUM2]. It also shows that she is determined because even though she failed at the test once she will try again She misses her house and wants hibiscus like she had in her old house.      

<START>

 

In this story, the reason the author concludes it this way is to choose a tone that feels comfortable testing again. The person who will take the test has chosen the tone based on their past that they take the time to prepare and that may be something their parents or grandparents taught them. 

<START>

 

The author concluded this because she thinks it is a good time to retest. She adds that as the snow is melted, the hibiscus is budding, and the return of the geese is a perfect time because everything is in and hot. She says "when they come back ... then I'll take the test again." means that she will be completely confident to pass the test. Saeng has vowed to iron it again and she will and she thinks that this time she will succeed. This is what the author concludes from the story.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope and meaning of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story like this because spring is the time for new beginnings and everything comes back to life and starts to grow again, so to speak, when the snow melts and the geese come back. "It is to say that it is the right time for a second chance. He failed the test, said Saeng ..... She tore off a leaf destroying it with the parasites." This shows the death of the hope she had or the hybisus symbolized it. That's why the author ended it like this because it shows new heqionqrys.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story, "Winter Hibiscus," with the strong one-sentence paragraph beginning that Saeng will pass the test when the geese return and the hibiscus buds. This line leaves the reader in suspense while also incorporating the main point of the story and combining them to express an idea of what might happen in a sequel about the future of @ CAPS1 and this story. After all, the reason Saeng bought the hibiscus was to comfort herself and her mother. As she stood staring at the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng's feelings for staying determined and passing the test. At the end, the author concluded the story with a chain phrase that not only summed up the story, but left a cliff hanging in the air.    

<START>

 

"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I 'll come back the test." The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes you think of the story after reading it.     

<START>

 

In many stories, the narrator uses a dramatic but conclusive statement to end the story. The new “Winter Hibiscus” is one example. In the story, the young girl ends up telling us when she will take her test again, but not directly to us as it says "Saeng swore himself in silence" but this always informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last “ wish ” is to not only inform the reader about the future, but also to show the girls the determination and the spiritual connection to the plant. For example, when he says "and this hibiscus is budding" it shows the girl the connection to the plant because of the comfort and confidence she has given him, especially because she has to pass the test. In conclusion, the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection that the girl was with her the flower and the homeland.       

<START>

 

In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that "why they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that will test again "(last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interested in flowers, she also cares about his school.When the snows melt, Saeng will pass the test just as the hibiscus buds and begins to bloom.   

<START>

 

Once they come Saeng was silently to herself, in the spring the snowmelt and the return of geese and hibiscus is Saeng then I am taking this test. She says this sentence that she herself is back home. She thinks it was familiar to Saeng . She herself is how much she has vowed to do it every season. His live is very calm and heavy. She feels like she belongs. Due to the failure of her driving test things were such a different thing for her from Vietnam and she expresses her feelings about this flower something.                                                                                           

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wants to remind the reader and summarize the story. The way she wants to sum up is how the story began with Saeng's failure of the end-of-story test with Saeng's planting hibiscus in the winter. The author wants to remind the reader of the whole story.  

<START>

 

It concludes this story like this so you don't feel like it's defeated. She is now more aware or thinks she can accomplish the task. In addition, she is more aware of herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home.  

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with this because just like the flower, she will return a new one, and so will she. The flower represents determination, using the flower to show one's own determination. Even though she failed her driving test, she is still determined to take it and try to pass it again. Even if it fails, she is determined to get over it. Just as the flower loses its buds in winter and pushes them back. Saeng forgets his failure and comes back a new one.     

<START>

 

The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of achievement and a new beginning for Saeng. She spent so much time missing out on the past that she didn't know how to take advantage of the present, which the author says in terms of “ living in the moment ”. The hibiscus represents strength, as his mother said, "It's strong enough to get through the winter months, ... that's what matters. The author finally says that hard times are inevitable, so hold on to the moments that make you smile because they will help you persevere in the difficult times.    

<START>

 

In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the character of Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. At the end of the story, Saeng swears to herself that at the end of winter, she will take the test again. I think the author ends the story like this to foreshadow Saeng's future. It seems the author is trying to say that Saeng will take the time to adjust to his new lifestyle and focus on other things before taking the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has already failed. Saeng's persistence shows and will help him overcome a lot in his new country. In the text, when Saeng's mother starts digging a hole, she says " let me help my mother ". It shows her love for her mother and her concern for the plant which represents her hobby. So at the end of the story, adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng's commitment.         

<START>

 

The author puts this excerpt into the text to show the reader that she made a mistake and will correct it in the future. I believe the other one put it on for this reason because in the text Saeng started crying when she admitted to her mother that she had failed the test. It shows that she was truly upset that she failed to hope to improve in the near future. Another reason why I think "the author concludes the story like this is to make the reader believe that Saeng is going to get over his home trouble."     

<START>

 

The author ends the story "Winter Hibiscus" with the passage "When they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will pass this again. test." She says how she will try to retake the test due to the fact that she failed the first time. I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her homeland, so she thought that when the hibiscus buds, she will retake the test. The plant made her think positively. And instead of thinking that she will fail, she thinks that she will succeed next time. I also think Saeng comforted her when she was upset and I think it made her feel a lot better.     

<START>

 

The author concludes this story, "Winter Hibiscus", with this paragraph as a sign of resilience. Saeng has had a difficult few years adjusting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge as an obstacle in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after failing her driving test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her way home. While in the greenhouse, she said, "That, at least, she could hang on to. But where was the fine tooth comb? The hibiscus hedge? Well? His sweet grandmother? Saeng missed all of this Vietnam stuff, especially during this difficult time. The last paragraph gives hope that she will retake the test and that all will be well. Winter is a symbol of the trials she has and will continue to go through. He said, “… in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again. Winter is a hardship for geese as they have to move away, hibiscuses have to survive the cold winter, and winter is when Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and hibiscus get over it, so will it. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so that the reader will know to have hope in life.                

<START>

 

That is why the author ended the story with this paragraph. This means that when she returns after winter, she will repeat her chores everywhere. For example she will dig, send flowers, their customers. Then, when winter returns, it will start again. So the other slyly uses different words to say at the end of winter that she will repeat her actions. That is why the author ended the story with this paragraph.     

<START>

 

The author took out the paragraph "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again", to represent the theme of the 'story. Saeng used hibiscus for hope in his life. The author also uses word choice or diction to explain how Saeng lived his life based on a flower. The paragraph also explains how its cultivation depends on the theme of the story.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant brings back memories to Saeng and it is a bit like the plant. Saeng can be compared to the plant by, she begins in a new area that she does not know, as well as the plant. The plant is now planted in the ground outside his house and should grow. Saeng must also learn to grow and improve and prepare to take the test again. So when the plant is cultivated and adapted, Saeng believes that it will also be cultivated and adapted. In conclusion, this paragraph is a perfect ending to the story “Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho.     

<START>

 

I think the author ends this story with this paragraph to explain what the story was about and also to say that Saeng would try the test again. In the story it is said "she realized that a lot of things that she considered strange before had become, although the silent repetition of the season on reason, is almost familiar to her now and this last paragraph help bring it all together. 

<START>

 

A wish is a good ending, she vowed to retake the test because she failed it. It expresses what she feels and she is committed to moving on. The author wanted to show a lot of feelings and how desperate she was. So she saw tons of beauty to go on.

The author ends the story as he does because it leaves hope, so that the story does not end sadly. She still has hopes of passing the driving test.        

<START>

 

She failed the test the same day she obtained the plant and saw the geese fly overhead. The plant and the geese are symbols for her. The plant represents her home, where she lived and the geese could represent how they move through life, overcoming the obstacles of cold and snow to something better, possibly a warmer climate. All this is for her the symbol of a new beginning. So she wanted to take it up again, at the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels that since she failed she should start over.

In Minfong Ho's short story "Winter Hibiscus", the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng, will retake his driver's license. She says she will do it "when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding." I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has something new. found hope. For example, since leaving Vietnam, she has been homesick. "She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'home', lest she burst into tears again." But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. “With us, it has grown wild, sticking out of cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. " Saeng even buys hibiscus planting in her garden in her new home. Having the hibiscus plant with her gave her memories of her old life and the strength to carry on with her new one. The plant gives him the strength to retry his driver's license. Concluding with this paragraph, it shows Saeng's change of emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives him.           

<START>

 

The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she shouldn't be afraid to try a new life or a new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, " These flowers are not pretty, but they are strong enough to get through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. “It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng has to be strong even in difficult times. Another example is, when the narrator says,“ she realized that a lot of things that she once considered strange before are have become, through the silent repetition of season after season… "It shows that saeng has realized that the new place she is leaving is right now is almost the same as their old home - In conclusion, the last paragraph says that saeng must do in the face of the new reality of the world, it must be strong and follow the course of life.

"In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that test again," Saeng thought to himself. Saeng finds herself in a new place where she has no friends. One day, she finds solace in a plant store when she stumbles upon a hibiscus flower. The flower calms her mind and helps her adjust to the changes in her life at this time.

The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns into spring, she will retake her driving test for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant that comes back to life and begins again, it will also start again. In the Saeng essay, the young girl said, "When they come back in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, then I will take the test again." @ CAPS1 Saeng failed the test the first time, she will wait until spring to have a fresh start. In the essay, "winter hibiscus" reminds Saeng of his grandmother and his house at @ LOCATION1. This makes her sad at first, but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her get through this difficult time. Her memories will give her the strength to move on with her life and retry her driver's license in the spring.      

<START>

 

The author ends it with this paragraph because the girl is talking about when the @ DATE1 or spring returns, she will try again. The author ends it with this because he explains what the young girl thinks of the spring and the animals. The girl says a lot about the geese in the story, so we know she loves animals.  

<START>

 

Then the author concludes the story with this paragraph as it sums up how memories and plants affect him. Much like the plant, Saeng grows best in her own country and likes it better there, but she can still survive in a new place if taken care of and fights to stay beautiful. The ending shows that Saeng realizes that if she tries harder, she can survive like the plant, so she'll retake the test. His mother said, “I saw this species blooming along the lake. Her flowers aren't quite as pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the cold months here. Her mother tries to tell her daughter that everything is fine and she is going through the hard times. Ultimately, Saeng knows she can.      

<START>

 

In the Winter Hibiscus, the author chose to end the story with a hopeful paragraph that said: "when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this Hibiscus buds , then I will take this test again. " The reasons for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents. Ideas of resilience in the face of challenges and the determination to adapt and succeed. Saeng's situation is similar to that of the flower, which was torn from its original location, replanted, and forced to try to survive the winter. Saeng has left her beloved homeland, she has to start her life over in another country and was faced with the obstacle of failing an unnamed test. In the last paragraph, she finds that, like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to be successful in her new home.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph (when they come back Saeng silently dedicates himself, in the springtime when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again) because it explains what she will do when winter is over. Also to let readers guess what will happen, to Saeng and his mother. Another reason is to have a new story at the end of winter.  

<START>

 

I know the reason why the author concludes the story as he doses and that is a good reason. He says since she failed this year next year when it's time to prepare the garden, she will say it again. This is good moral because you have to keep trying and trying to be successful because even if you fail you don't lose any progress. It's like what happened to him @ PERSON1 even though it took @ DATE1 to try to make the light bulb successfully, he just said "I just found out @ NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb." So I agree with this author and the way he ended the story.                    

<START>

 

She does this to show her struggle with her custody struggle. It's like that because every year she has to work her garden because winter wins, that is to say, it kills it. 

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows how Saeng will not give up. Saeng wants to make her mother proud so she will try to do whatever it takes. All Saeng tries to do is make his mother happy. When she failed, her mother was disappointed. Then surprisingly understanding. When Saeng told her mother that she had failed, Saeng started to cry, but her mother then wiped away her tears.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it means that when the shovel grows back in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back, and this hibiscus is budding, it repeats the test. She will therefore wait until next spring to take the test. 

<START>

 

In the story, the test was whether she could get over her homesickness. When she wants to the greenhouse all. plants and flowers brought back memories of his homeland. When she saw the flower, it reminded her of a life where she was drawing water from a well and a flower was floating in it. So after the winter, she would go back to the place to see if she was still homesick. I think she ended up this way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again      

<START>

 

I think the author adds the last paragraph because the story could use a small portion on Saeng. And what she plans to do next. Also, author @ MONTH1 added this paragraph because she might be thinking about writing a second Winter Hibiscus story, and they wanted to write a part that could be about the next story. One might wonder if she repeats the test, will she pass it this time after the snowmelt, the geese return and the hibiscus budding. I think this @ MONTH1 is the reason the author added this paragraph to the story.    

<START>

 

I think the author concluded the story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First of all, when saeng saw the hibiscus for the first time, she was sad, but after seeing the flower, she became happy. Then his mother helps him plant it and Saeng is sure he will be there in the spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since reflecting on her past   

<START>

 

I think Minfong Ho concluded her “Winter Hibiscus” story as she did to show the greedy determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test but got the hibiscus and it helped her regain her resolve to pass the test. Now that she's had a few moments of her homeland and family there, she's probably been reminded that they would have wanted her to pass, so she vows to herself that she'll take that test again when the plant of hibiscus will begin to bud. This is why I have the impression that "Winter Hibiscus" was concluded this way.   

<START>

 

At the end of the “Winter Hibiscus” test by @ CAPS1 Ho, it ends in a positive way. "When they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." The reason I think the author decided to put it there was to show what Saeng thought of his country. So when the country she is has spring again, she will pass this test because this country reminds her of her home country in the spring. Which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least pass the test. This is why the author has put this sentence at the end of the essay.     

<START>

 

Saeng promises himself that in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again. The hibiscus is metaphorical for Saeng for his childhood. Obviously she grew up in Vietnam and moved to @ LOCATION2. He misses his homeland and all the flowers remind him of his homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories as she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adapt, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to face it though, and planting winter hibiscus is one way to deal with it. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change because she has realized that "a lot of things that she once considered strange had become ... almost familiar to her now." She promises herself that she will take the driving test again when the hibiscus blooms because like Saeng a flower also changes. When the hibiscus finally gets over the cold, gloomy winter months and blooms, Saeng will know that she is ready to take the test again because this flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they must migrate south in winter to avoid the cold but return home when it is warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable.                

<START>

 

So she says she will take the test next year.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story of the end because I think the author concludes the end of the story because he sort of means that I will be ready next year to sprout again, he will be ready to test it so as not to cry and crack when he sees the plant thinking of childhood memories he will be ready o

Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden and remind him of his homeland. She has failed some sort of test and is upset. Her mom feels bad for her so she doesn't get upset that the hibiscus cost @ MONEY1. After having planted the hibiscus, Saeng said to himself, .... In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I will do this test again. The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether Saeng will fail or pass the test again. We also wonder what kind of test since the author says “the hibiscus is budding”, and “the geese are coming back”, it must be a test that can only be taken once a year. because she says that "In the spring", she will take the test again.      

<START>

 

The author has concluded this paragraph in this story because I think he is trying to convey a message to the reader. The author is trying to say that if a plant can get through the cold winter, then it can pass its driving test. That's why I think the author included this paragraph.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the “ Winter Hibiscus ” story with “ When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take this test again. " The author ends with promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng promising himself "I'll take this test again," shows his determination and refusal to fail. This is enough to give hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and shows Saeng's good character. It shows Saeng's strength because even though she failed the first time around, she was going to start to endure the pain of trying to be successful again. Failure and retry shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because “when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding”. brings everything back in loop. It contains the promise of spring and better things to come. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with "when they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again" .              

<START>

 

The author added it at the end not only to give the story a happy and hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng has slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The above paragraph explains that Saeng realized that "many things that seemed strange before had become ... almost familiar now." So, the author finally concludes that even if she failed the test this time, just as the geese will come back in the spring, then she can retake the test. It just comes from the point of the story and it's a "happy" way to end it.   

<START>

 

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" concludes the story with: "When they returned Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will do the test. again. ", to show that the hibiscus plant gave Saeng hope. It helped him through some tough and difficult times. In the story, Saeng just failed her @ CAPS1 test and had to walk home. She was very upset. On the way home, Saeng saw a familiar flower. She had walked into a flower shop to see if they were selling the hibiscus she had seen. The employee pointed her at the flower. The hibiscus brought back many memories to its hometown in Vietnam. Saeng planted his flowers in the vegetable garden. This flower had given him hope. She is ready to retry the @ CAPS1 test.          

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example, it is from winter that the hibiscus die. In addition, she leaves and will not return until she can replant flowers in the spring, and she will return when she retakes the test. In conclusion, this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.   

<START>

 

The reason the author of "Winter Hibiscus" ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope until the end. It gives a certain burst of joy at the end of a moderately depressing story. It just shows that if you care enough, you can keep moving forward. And may the end of your world come when you do. This is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end.        

<START>

 

The character has what appears to be a new self-confidence and a new joy from the plant that reminds her of her native land, comforts her and motivates her. She says when these things return, she will endeavor to complete the test. She sets a time to push herself. Like most people try to do    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much you sometimes have to wait for the right moment to try again ... For example, in the book it is written " Madagascar periwinkle, its label announced : “ How strange it is to see it in apat,“ Back home he has gone wild, sticking out of cracks in brick walls or between roofs. ” This shows that anything can be done when the time is right. came.     

<START>

 

Emotions, symbols, for that, are all reasons why the author concluded the story this way. one of the reasons the author ended the story this way is to leave you with mixed emotions. Emotions like sadness, hope and hurt. The author makes the reader sad because the girl fails her test and misses at home. The author also gives the feeling of hope that they will one day return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be said. the author uses symbols in the conclusion, phrases giving the plant and geese a sense of helplessness in the story and the plant has to do with the house he really misses. In the final story, the author leaves many apprehensions about several. Like the importance of the plant and why they moved from a place they coveted so much. That's why I think the author ended the story this way.         

<START>

 

In the winter story, Hibiscus Saeng loves the beautiful flowers that once grew in his homeland. Her favorite flower was the Winter Hibiscus which had beautiful velvet-red pedals. She also failed a test she had taken, so what the story is trying to say is that nothing can be as good as what's at home, but sometimes you just need a another chance for something.  

<START>

 

I think he did it because he wanted to show how he loved everything in life.

<START>

 

The reason the author of the story ended the story like this is because after all the hard times this plant has been through, it will still be bad at the end of winter. The author said the plant would undergo this test again. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One of the reasons is that the author is trying to say that she will overcome the obstacle (the test) no matter what. In the text, it says “ it can get through the cold months. ”@ CAPS1 the consumer who also supports the last paragraph, she is in a new country and begins a new beginning. In the text it says "Not like the same genre we had before". This implies that he is different in this country and that she will adapt soon. Finally, it is written “ this hibiscus is budding ”, which means it will bloom.                                  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is alone, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that she has found something that reminds her of her life before she left.

<START>

 

The author ends the story like this so that readers can understand the theme. That is, you can always start over after a mistake. For example, saeng failed the herbal driving test, then it cost her dearly, she will try again in the spring. I guess she thinks that once she renews herself she will do better.     

<START>

 

Explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because that all adds up to a dime to wrap up the story with that. Here is why I think so. The paragraph in one of the main pieces of the story. "In the spring when the snows melt and after the return," all she says is when the snow is gone and the grass comes back, I will start planting again and she would be happy, "this hibiscus is budding, so I I'm going to take that back, "she went to put her plants back in place and is testing them to see how they end so she can do them again. Saeng loved this plant so much that she can't wait. But when it does. , she will plant a lot. This is what the paragraph says, Saeng will wait to be able to plant a hibiscus. However, since she came to the United States, she was very fond of the flower.        

<START>

 

Because for her, it's the best time to do things because all the happy memories come back with the geese and the hibiscus.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus motivates her to pass her driving test. In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, she will take this test again. 

<START>

 

Several reasons, first of all, in the spring she will have had more time to adapt to her new life. Plus, when the hibiscus begins to bud, she will feel comforted, as if it automatically reminds her of her childhood memories. It is also a link with his past in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in the soil, it will adapt and be ready to retest. It is as if when the plant is ready to start budding, it will be ready as well.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this sentence dedicated to the flower. It just indicates that Saeng will come back and try again next year and see if it works with the hibiscus. 

<START>

 

The author put the paragraph to show that he cares about flowers. Flowers only come out in the spring and at the time of @ DATE2 and that's when you plant, study whatever is growing in a garden. So she can pass the test and be happy with the garden.  

<START>

 

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" ends the story with the paragraph "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again. " for several reasons. Especially because the flowering of the hibiscus represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and grow back and grow strong again. The same goes for Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she does not want to be, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship. Likewise, hibiscus can withstand winter. is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope.

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", Saeng makes a wish for himself. “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that test again,” that wish means that she will start fresh, make changes and adjust to her new life. She wants to disappoint her mother and she won't be shattered by her memories. She concluded the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph that says: "When they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, I will take this test again", because the 'author wants to convey this. Saeng is not going to give up. She is determined to take and pass the test. It also means that saeng will wait for the right time to take the test. She will wait for things to improve. The situation she finds herself in is improving because she says, " The snow melts, the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding." "  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this last paragraph because it shows that in the spring, she will be ready to take her test again. This shows that like the geese who care and come back, she will have time to study and pass her exam. In the story, the author includes this last paragraph to really show his dedication to finally becoming comfortable in his new home and passing his driving test on time. Saeng wants to be comfortable with his new life but is not yet because of what he lacks. But she knows that after that she will be able to go back and try again as geese often do our winter. It was a very effective way to end the story as it really communicated Saeng's message of dedication and his desire to overcome his obstacles, his new home and his conduct.      

<START>

 

I think the author concludes this way because it's almost like a fresh start. The end of the story suggests that Saeng will go on with his life. It makes me think that @ CAPS1 is planning to start life over again compared to hibiscus. Once the plant " starts again " (let's re- stalk), it will start again. It also shows that she is determined to continue her life at @ LOCATION1. She won't let her life be turned upside down by her move to Vietnam. She hopes to be able to start her life again. The ending is a “ cliff hanger ” to show that its story is not yet completely over. This shows that there is still a possibility that she can continue with her life. It also shows that she doesn't let her failures control her. She is a strong young woman determined to overcome this.              

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a very good end paragraph that catches your attention a bit. It also shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, which makes you think this is a determined story. That is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again when she sees the plant and relishes what it symbolizes for her. Another example is that she says she wants to plant the hibiscus on her own so that she keeps the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this way.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was trying to say that since the hibiscus is planted, we'll see how it goes with winter. And when spring comes and he's still up, she can go do the test. I think the author was comparing the hibiscus to their life and the obstacles they would go through, so if the hibiscus is still standing it means that everything will be fine until the place where it can return and pass the test .  

<START>

 

The last paragraph of "Winter Hibiscus" describes a person's determination and growth. Saeng says that when "this hibiscus buds, I will take this test again." Much like the hibiscus blooms, Saeng will bloom and strive throughout the winter to try and pass his test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she can't be sad forever. She must be determined to pass the test. The next season will be a kind of revival, starting fresh and coming out beautiful like a hibiscus in bloom.       

<START>

 

"Winter Hibiscus" author Minfong Ho concluded her story with the paragraph explaining how, when the geese are there and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will retake her driving test, as she wanted to end on a happy note. Early in the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to @ LOCATION2, failed his driving test. She had found a plant they had in Vietnam, but it made her sad. "I mean, it's not like the kind we had to - to -," she found she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she melt into it again. tears. " (Ho, @ NUM1) So ending up describing some positive things for the future, Saeng might think about it and distract himself from everything else.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for very good reason. In the distance, she lets go and waits to pick it up. I think it's a good thing she found the flower. That's because it let her and her mom make her better. For example, when we say "the geese are coming back and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng, changed from the beginning to the end of the story. It shows a small amount of newfound confidence that Saeng has now. This ending also shows how bad the “winter hibiscus” has got on her. by bringing back memories of his old country. If Saeng hadn't found the hibiscus, she would never have started to remember her old home. This memory not only reminded her of her past, but also helped her compare her new home to her old one. Because of this, she realized that life at @ LOCATION1 is not that bad and that she still has a bit of her old home with her every day. This realization gave him just enough hope and confidence to want to retry the driving test. This ending shows the change of mind Saeng feels for @ LOCATION1 and his little gain in hope and confidence.        

<START>

 

 The author decides to end the story with this because she wants the moral of the story to be etched in your head. She believes that you will always have a chance to try again and the flower will cycle over and have another chance to bud and this symbolizes that you can start over and try again just like the girl is going to do in the test. She repeats the test on restart so that she can do it. she with the flower and the flower bud will support her and give her hope.   

<START>

 

I believe the author ends the story the way she did because she talks about both topics. The author tries to say that when she gets her driver's license next spring, the hibiscus will give her confidence to pass her driver's license. The author  

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start from scratch. I think so because when she talks to her mum at the end of the story, she says "In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will retest". She says she wants to start over. and adapt to his new country. Also, I think this is because she wants to wait for the seasons to change to retake her test. because she says "when the snow melts and the geese come back". She says this because she wants a brand new slate when she takes her test again. That's why I think she wanted to end her story this way.       

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story like this because it shows the time that will pass. When it shows that time is passing she has grown up and maybe she will be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is. Also, because the hibiscus will be budding, it will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed, as all of this will make her feel more secure in her home. " The hibiscus is budding " in this way, the flower will start again and so will it.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she has to adapt to the new country. She wants to wait for the hibiscus to bud. The budding plant shows that it is adapting to a new environment just like Saeng. History shows that Saeng is not used to the new country. she cries when she sees the plants because it reminds her of her old home. The plant comforts her too. when she adjusts to the new country, she will take the test again.      

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again because Saeng did not pass his. test and knew her mom would be angry so that's why she got the flower.If she hadn't failed her test, she probably wouldn't have gotten the flower in the first place. 

<START>

 

The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a wish to herself as it shows how important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her determination because it reminds her of home. Saeng said, "... and this hibiscus is budding, so I'll take the test again." The hibiscus flower gives him confidence. It reminds him of his home in Vietnam before they moved to @ LOCATION2. Therefore, the author concludes the story with this certain paragraph because it symbolizes the importance of the flower.     

<START>

 

She feels very attached to this hibiscus plant because it reminds her of her native country. I think she's trying to tell when the hibiscus plant shows it's inner budding that she will. The plant has to strive to produce flowers, and the sight has to be careful to melt the snow, which means it has to come out and melt all its habits and get what it wants to do. to pass the test. But still not forgetting where she came from and all the memory left in bed. " ... silently devoted herself to herself ... then I'll take that test again." "                 

<START>

 

In the story " winter @ CAPS1 ", the author concludes the story with the last paragraph like this because when the season returns for budding, it will be back out there to explore. She's going to want to know more about hibiscus and what they do. And she can't wait to start caring for them as they begin to bud. That's why they ended the story with this paragraph.     

<START>

 

There are several reasons why this paragraph is included. This shows that the flower will encourage her emotionally when she is budding, because it will remind her of her home. This is shown when she says "a flower of two would have blown into the well". It reminds him of his homeland. It is also to show that she is adjusting to her new home. when the geese walked past she said "she realized that a lot of things that she once considered strange had become almost familiar to her now." It shows how she is adjusting and enjoying her new life now. This last paragraph is important because it shows how his life is changing.      

<START>

 

Author says she'll be ready soon when the flowers start to grow and the geese start coming home, she'll be ready

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it failed the driving test. She says when it gets a little warmer outside and the plants are sprouting, she might take the test again and hopefully pass. I know she failed the test because it said, "As Saeng comes home after failing her driving test." I guess the snow on the ground is causing it to make mistakes during the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.            

<START>

 

In "@ CAPS1 Hibiscus", the author concludes the story with "in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again", to make a point. She needs all of this to happen for her to be healthy enough to take the test again. 

<START>

 

The author ended the story this way because the plant represents a fresh start that Saeng needs. Seang failed his test and needed reassurance. She went to the greenhouse and spent @ MONEY1 on a hibiscus plant that reminded her of her home. At the same time, the hibiscus plant reminded him that his new home is another new beginning. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng better hopes that starting over can be a good thing and that the next time she takes the test she will pass.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph @ CAPS1 reason why he does it because he wants to conclude by writing about geese. Second, he loves plants and the season in which they are budding. He swore he would take this test in the spring. He can't wait for the snow to melt so he can pass the test.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants the same environment and everything she wanted before when she took the test

<START>

 

The author's choice of words in the story's conclusion, I believe sent to let the reader know the story continues. But, I think the test is to remind him of the house. 

<START>

 

Author @ CAPS1 the story with "When they come back Saeng silently swore to himself." in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this Hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again. She @ CAPS1 with that because she starts the story with Saeng failing her driver's license test. and also she thought the winter hibiscus was good luck after she disappeared and how she and fimerlary with @ CAPS3 who would be the geese she reunited @ CAPS3 and that's why she said when the geese come back and let the snow melt .. .... That's why she said it.    

<START>

 

I think Saeng concluded with this story because there is always time to catch up with the past if the past allows you to mean that @ CAPS1 did not pass the test. I understood that she had encountered that "in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again", for me that means that even if it is snowing outside, it there is always next spring to start cultivating the vegetable garden again this also concerns Saeng even though she failed the test, there is always another change that we can catch up and try again and try to pass this one.

The author concludes the story "Winter Hibiscus" with this sentence when they return saeng to silently dedicate themselves to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again . " The winter hibiscus symbolizes her attachment to where she used to live. It's not a real one I mean not the kind we had to-to" she was still too shaky to say the words to the house "when the hibiscus buds" she will always love her house but she will have adapted better to her current environment. The geese will have returned home, which means she will one day find a home there. When she finds this place, she will find herself ready to "take the test" or do things normally. The author concluded the story with this sentence to show that Saeng will eventually grow up in his new life.    

<START>

 

The author concluded the story like this because it was positive. As the geese come back, she's sure she can take the test again. She knows she will pass the test. In the story, she said "Many things that she once considered strange had become, through silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar to her now." This means that when she had just moved in here she thought everything was strange because, she had never seen anything like it before. Now that she lives here, she will get used to it because, she knows what will happen, nothing will become strange to her anymore since it is her home now

The reader thinks the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl says she will try again and pass this test. In the story " Winter Hibiscus ", Saeng the girl passed a test and failed it. And she had this flower that brought back memories of the past and she decided to take this test now that things are going to get even better. Also, when the girl saw these geese flying above her, she knew that they would come back, come back after winter in the spring, and when they do, her flower will bloom, the one that will bring back fond memories of the past and she will resume this test and passed. These are a few examples of why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this story because she loves her homeland and her father and loves her mother. She loves greenery and can't wait to say spring is coming. then she will pass the test of not being in her place, which is why she concludes the story this way.  

<START>

 

The author of the story "Winter Hibiscus" concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls' determination and let the reader anticipate more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do the right thing, but leaving the story hanging creates excitement for more action. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things that she had previously found strange had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was heartwarming and reminded Saeng of his home. she says "In the spring when the snows melt" because she is starting to get used to "the quiet rehearsal from season to season". Geese, which form a distinctive V, become familiar to him. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story as it shows that Saeng is getting used to his new surroundings and has high hopes for the future.         

<START>

 

When they come back, Saeng swore silently, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take this test again. The main purpose of the author of these lines was to grab the attention of readers by making a continuous paragraph as it adapts to the circumstances. Saeng values the uniqueness of plants, she is also reinforced by memories of her homeland  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph "when they return Saeng silently swore to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again", to conclude that she will wait. a little while, until the plants can be planted, so if she fails again she will have something to hold onto. For example, when Saeng "failed @ NUM1), she tries to overcome the feeling of failure by buying something that reminds her of her country and brings back memories of the past this time. Another example is when Saeng" felt a recognition shock so intense, it was almost visceral (@ NUM2), she forgot everything that was going on in her life, from moving to @ LOCATION1 to failing her test, that feeling focused her on the feel like home again. In conclusion, the author's conclusion creates the belief that saeng overcomes its problems by remembering memories like the plant, which remind it of its home country.   

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story this way with the snow that Saeng will be like next year. She has now said that all the new things @ CAPS1 seemed strange to her when she first came here, but now they are now second nature to her . I think the hibiscus is a box of hope and inspiration for her. I think she finally realizes that she is staying @ LOCATION1 and she can go back to vietnam. So, it must accept that it is by the house and I think she is on her way to do it.                                                                                                         

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith in a new beginning. Saeng compares himself to hibiscus. When the " hibiscus is @ NUM1), it will retake the test. This shows that when the hibiscus starts its life again, it will start again too. Saeng believes that when the hibiscus is " strong enough to get through the cold (NUM2), then she is strong enough to pass her driving test and live in a new country." Winter and cold represent death, and spring represents new life or a new beginning. Saeng thought to himself: “In the spring… I will take the test @ NUM3). It's a new start for Saeng, a new hope.

In the story "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho, the author decided to end it with the phrase "when they return, Saeng silently swore to herself, in the spring." When the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I will take this test again, because it shows that even though the main character Saeng, @ MONTH1 failed once, she will try again too. The geese will be coming back to try a new spring and the hibiscus will be budding new flowers so that its like its leaving again as well and Saeng says that if the two have done it once they have tried again then she may as well , but this time it will succeed. Also, it shows the determination that all living things have to achieve their primary goal. The pilot flowers bud again. The geese lead to return again during the spring and the main character of the readers to take the test. The author of "Winter Hibiscus", Minfong Ho, put this quote as the last line of the story for inspiration. To inspire the people to pursue the path of life and if you fail, try again. So, the author gives you the inspiration to help you continue living your life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

<START>

 

In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng swears to herself that she will retake the driving test in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings him. She describes peaceful things in nature, such as geese and hibiscus, from which she draws her strength because they remind her of her homeland. That way she will always have a little piece of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng relates to nature and draws his strength from it. Her mother has a garden and she relies on the fact that she has a different past, preferring natural foods like bitter melons to @ LOCATION1. This final paragraph shows the hope that the beautiful nature of his homeland brought to Saeng, helping him adjust to life in a new place.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that it will hopefully be stronger. By that I mean that she will feel comfortable in her new surroundings and that she will want her home to miss her as much. Plus, she tired the year but failed at best because she didn't get what she asked for from her grandmother and she spent it on something else. That's why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph as it shows the main character, Saeng, adjusting and doing his best with his new lifestyle. For example, when she swore to herself in the last paragraph saying, "In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that test again." This implies that she devotes more effort to what she does in her new environment and new settings. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how someone adapts to change.   

<START>

 

The author includes it because he uses metaphors to explain how the author felt about Saeng's personal life.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with a paragraph because it shows Saeng's sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she disappointed her. For example, she feels bad for having upset her mother, and while her mother is gardening, she says, “ Here, let me help you, mother ”, because her mother's frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mother that she had failed the driving test, she even knew she shouldn't look at her because she was upset. However, in the end, her mother was happy to have had her, saying, “It's a beautiful plant, I'm glad you have it,” which shows that mother and daughter have a close relationship. . This is why Saeng's sympathy for self-improvement is shown in the story's conclusion.          

<START>

 

The story "Winter Hibiscus" tells the story of a young girl who takes care of the gardening before her homework. The given conclusion explains that when spring comes and the winter hibiscus is gone, she will pass the school test that she failed before. Saeng only cares about winter hibiscus at the moment, for example, the line "I paid over nineteen dollars for this". Explain that she used all her money for this plant rather than for any other food. Moreover, the quote "I failed the test" with Saeng in tears shows that she failed only because she was worried about the hibiscus. In conclusion, in the spring, when the winter hibiscus is gone, Saeng will focus more on school than gardening. Maybe now she will pass her exam and go back to her gardening hobby.      

<START>

 

The author has a good reason why she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, leaves Vietnam for the United States and fails his driving test. Saeng has not adapted to life in the United States and when she sees a firmilaire hibiscus plant, she buys it for her memories of Vietnam. The author tries to show that since Saeng planted the hibiscus during the winter, when it blooms in the spring, she will be ready to try to pass her driving test because she will have adapted life in the United States. The theme of the story would be if you walk away from a place where you grew up, bring things that remind you of that place so that you still have a bit of that culture with you. The author therefore begins and ends with the same subject.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the “Winter Hibiscus” story with a sentence about taking the driving test again in the spring, to express the themes of adaptation to circumstances and the determination to succeed. The main character of the story, Saeng, is an immigrant @ CAPS1. Because @ CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here that she is not used to, and history shows her struggle to adjust. For example, when she sees the flower " Madagascar penwinhle ", she thinks " how strange it is to see it in a pot " because " with us it grows in the wild ", The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says " and the geese come back," Because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng tries to do, and Saeng realizes that their model becomes. familiar. The very last line says "I'll take this test again". It sums up Saeng's determination throughout the story. Not only is she determined to pass her driving test, but also in other areas. For example, while trying to plant hibiscus, Saeng observes that “the ground was cold and hard, and she was having trouble sticking her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, however, she has "dug a hole" and knows he's strong enough to move it through the cold months, just as Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence of the story is significant. It expresses important themes and gives valuable insight into Saeng's character.                   

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with the paragraph to define the theme of the sonip. In the story, the @ CAPS1 represents a very important thing for saeng - confidence, beauty, adaptation… some things that she can apply to herself and to her memories of her old homeland. She had failed her driver's license. Subsequently, she bought the @ CAPS1 to relieve her homesickness. I saw the @ CAPS1 as some kind of Saeng metaphor, the same @ CAPS1, but growing differently in a different realm, just like she's still the same but in a new home. The meaning of the last paragraph mainly concerns the @ CAPS1 budding. He represents for Saeng his homeland by the flowering of @ CAPS1, it can represent his love for the homeland. When the author wrote "then I'll take this test again", it refers to the new confidence she @ MONTH1 has later when the @ CAPS1 blooms (another @ CAPS1 / person metaphor)       

<START>

 

Author @ PERSON1, concludes the story '' Winter hibiscus with this paragraph to show Saeng starting over ''… In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding… @ CAPS1 in his life, is that it is in a way a new beginning. Although @ MONTH1 misses her old life, her grandmother, the well and the fine tooth comb, she makes an effort and '' redo this test ... '' By recounting the test, she shows that she does not 'is not ready to give in to the' '@ CAPS2 of the loss. and to his grief.     

<START>

 

The author ends the story with "When they come back Saeng silently swears, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again." because she concludes that the hibiscus comforts her and once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In fact, seeking solace from a plant seems silly, but it is not that she has solace in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home that she misses so much. Once the plant thrives, like her tropical home, she believes it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.    

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how the plant will grow, Saeng too. After failing the driving test, saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds him of his real home in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think of all the memories and she takes comfort even if we say so. She uses this plant as a comfort tool to help her think about when to come and all the good memories to help lift her spirits. So to strengthen her self-confidence , she decides to plant him. “ The winter hibiscus was now in the ground and Saeng compacted the soil around it. "Then she sees geese flying in the sky, which is kind of a symbol that day, something you remember , so the following year." When the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding. She will take the test again. These things bring back fond memories to her that help make her stronger.                             

<START>

 

I think Saeng has to take the test because to get his grade. Saeng is wary of snow in spring because she thinks of the flower covering itself. Saeng's mother delayed helping with pepper and melons, and delayed his state dinner.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants us to know that she is not giving up on her test. The author wishes to inform readers that she is not giving up " ... then I will take that pacifier back ", which is a clear indication that she still has hope. The author wants to continue his test to find the right flower. That is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.      

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph because during the winter everything goes out until the spring when everything is animated again, the Saeng would feel more motivated to pass the test well. Saeng is much like the plant, strives and worries in the winter, then blooms beautifully in the spring. Also, I think of the memories that the winter hibiscus plant brought him; Motivated her to stop staying in the past and move forward into the future.       

<START>

 

He wrote this because he talks about climate change           

<START>

 

The author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it essentially relates the plants to itself, which means that the plant will also flower when taking the test. and her reason might be b / c or is b / c reluctantly, she realized that many things that she once considered strange had become, through season-to-season repetition, almost familiar to her now. Basically, she did as the geese looked up as she watched their distinctive V etch into the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance. That's why I believe the author but this to conclude the story ... because she compared herself to geese and does like them   

<START>

 

The author describes the last quote because he wants his dream to come true. We describe “ She realized that a lot of the things she had been thinking about was the quiet rehearsal of the season, almost familiar to her now. Saeng is from Vietnam and his family has a @ CAPS1 dream. therefore the author wants his family to adapt their new life to @ LOCATION2.    

<START>

 

She says this because right now it is winter and flowers can grow in winter due to the cold. So, she says that when spring returns, she will do the test to grow the flowers again. In conclusion, this is why the author states this conclusion at the end of the paragraph.  

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph to give you a sense of hope and determination for the future that lives in Saeng at that time .Throught the story is seemed like Saeng was giving in despair at the memory of her homeland, she was not doing so well in her new country and she had achieved this the most when she had "failed her driving test ". but when she walked past the flower shop and saw all the plants that used to be blooming freely and beautifly in her earth house feeling good in these pots and fighting to survive in them reminded her of herself here at @ LOCATION1. As she began to plant her hibiscus, she compared herself to it again and that is why when her plant blooms so well in the spring, she will pass this test.                             

<START>

 

The author concludes this by telling the story this because he thought it would be okay because in Valkay on how the hibisuse is still grass in the winter and how all the geese will return home and stay there. because they hate winter. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story using this paragraph for several reasons. One of the reasons is Saeng's change of attitude. At the start of the story, Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but adding this paragraph at the end of the story shows that she has hope and that 'she won't give up. Another reason this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life goes on in the most difficult situations. The fact that a new season begins figuratively shows that Saeng won't always feel this way that she too will change. In conclusion the story with this paragraph for a few good reasons.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph, I think because since the girl failed her test the bud reminds her of her grandmother's long gray hair and I guess it brings her luck, so when the winter passes and as spring arrives, the buds begin to appear. come back and that's when she'll retake her test. This is why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story. 

<START>

 

I'll tell you why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One of the reasons the author does this is because he tells you that Saeng is confident. It also tells you that she won't give up. And it shows that she's ready to take her abilities to the next level. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.    

<START>

 

THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY HEAR TO SHOW THE EXPECTED CLARIFICATION OF THE SAENG COMPLEX DILEMMA. IN THE SENTENCE, "WHEN THEY RETURN", THE AUTHOR IS LIKELY TO REFER TO THE FLOWERS OF HIBISCUS WHICH REPRESENT THE FUNDAMENTAL MEMORIES OF HIS HISTORICAL COUNTRY. THE AUTHOR ILLUSTRATE SAENG'S STRUGGLE TO ADAPT TO HER NEW LIFE THROUGH A “TEST” OF PLANTATION OF THE BOWLS, AS SHE DID AT HOME WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. THIS TEST REPRESENTS THE REALIZATION OF ADAPTATION TO HIS NEW LIFE. FOR THIS REASON, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED HIS STORY WITH THE PARAGRAPH INDICTING THAT SAENG WILL IN EFFECT RESUME THIS TEST.    

<START>

 

The author decided to end the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's determination to adjust to his new life. In the third paragraph of the second page, the author writes, “ Saeng was looking at the white button in her hand now, small and fragile… At least she could hang onto it. " Having failed his driving test, Saeng felt alien and alone. She desperately regarded the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back heartwarming memories to her, so she bought one of the plants and came back. After a discussion with her mother, Saeng understands that she has to deal with her new home, just as the flower has to adapt to her new surroundings. Concluding the story, with this declared sentence, the author informs the reader that Saeng must " bloom " in his new home to do well. She still needs time for this, as the flowers need time to plant their roots in the ground.           

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Maybe to show that she would do it all over again if she had to. For example "When they come back Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again", so basically she says she is ready to pass this step, this chance. The author ended the story with this confidence and courage.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph: "When they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, I will retest the test." She does this eventually in the hopes of taking the test again and doing good. Also, the author ends it this way because Saeng believes in herself, so she made a vow to do something about it. Hopefully this will encourage her more and motivate her as well.   

<START>

 

The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that with winters to come things will die out and then come back next spring. It refers to the plant. I think she keeps track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to her mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng can't wait to see how flower buds bloom next spring and what other new things she's experiencing @ MONTH1.   

<START>

 

Well I think the author concludes the story like this because he's showing her her best known attitude now that she's changing, so she's going to focus on whatever she has to do and she's going to iron it out again. test with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away.

<START>

 

The author decides to end the story with the paragraph to show a lot of things. First of all, the author uses the last paragraph to show his optimism. The whole story had been sad but the end shows some hope. At the beginning it is written: " @ CAPS1 of such deep loss ... " (@ NUM1) and at the end it is written : " I will take this test again. " (@ NUM2) shows how his attitude Password cynical optimist. Another reason the story ends with this paragraph is to show how Saeng accepted. When the story says the geese were “almost familiar to her now.” (@ NUM2) shows that although Saeng is sad to leave her home, she is adjusting quite well. Therefore, the author ends the story with an inspiring paragraph to show the change for the better.                         

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph indicating when spring and @ DATE2 will return, then she will retake the test. This means that she will plant the flowers and grow them again. Hopefully she won't fail. For example, "Mrs. Lambert, liked. That bitter and tangy melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue."   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to end it on a high note and sending a good message there isn't going to stop because they failed the first time around.

<START>

 

I'm saying the only reason the author included that last paragraph was to show that she wasn't going to give up easily. She was going to take it back again, she might be lucky with the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day after failing her driving test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower so she went to a florist to see if she could buy it. When she buys it, she comes home and gives it to her mother and they plant it. So maybe it can remind him of fond memories of his hometown or just luck I think.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this passage because it is symbolic. When the geese come back in the spring, it will be like a start now. When the Hibiscus buds, it has new life. When all of this happens, Saeng will also have a fresh start. Letting the story end like this is suspense for some. It makes you want more, knowing that she failed her test, you want to know if Saeng will pass this spring, @ CAPS1 a fresh start. Everything and everyone will have new beginnings when the start of the new season arrives when the hibiscus blooms, it will be as if she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, new connections with her past and comfort during difficult times. . The Hibiscus symbolizes all of this       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because that is what it is. Saeng has seen what happens in winter and when it comes back she tries to memorize it so that she can't know what will happen. 

<START>

 

The author ends the story this way because by the end of winter, she will have adapted to her new society, just like the hibiscus.

<START>

 

The young girl Saeng from the story "Winter Hibiscus" by minfong Ho, has left her homeland of Vietnam for the United States. The girl hoped to get her driver's license but failed. The hibiscus she sees comforts her by reminding her of Vietnam. When she buys it, her mother worries about the price but sees how sick her daughter is at home and becomes understanding. After planting the hibiscus, she looks at the geese and understands that each year they change their habitat. The geese inspire Saeng with the Hibiscus and promises himself that in the spring when the snow melts the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I will retest the test.

<START>

 

The author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an ending. With this saeng, tell @ LOCATION1 that all the snow is gone, it will take the test again. If we now read between lifetimes, it says more than that. She is very fond of hibiscus and when the hibiscus comes back to life in the spring, she will have new energy to repeat the test. From her experience with hibiscus, we can see that this plant really influenced her. Because this plant reminds him so much of his old home. We can also see that everything and everyone should get a second chance. In her case, this is the test she wants to take again. Also in the spring, she lives a few months at @ LOCATION1 and she will adapt to this new situation. At the moment, she is only homesick, even though her home is @ LOCATION1 now. So the hibiscus is good for her, some think she can cling to her old house ...                            

<START>

 

The author: minfong Ho, ends the story thus to show the overcoming of obstacles. The story shows the many difficulties faced by saeng when she leaves her old house to join her new one. On the day described. She fails a driving test, skips lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old house. In addition, this paragraph shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes it. The plant is not in its native home, faces many difficulties; cold its little pot, and even its general environment. In every way, the plant is in the same circumstances as the main character and the last paragraph is used to tie them together.         

<START>

 

The reason the author used this paragraph is because it was sagging that the snow went away in the spring than everything.

<START>

 

The last paragraph only means one thing. That one thing is to be like a Hibiscus @ CAPS1 to take the test of life again. See will return in the spring as will the Hibiscus. So, as you can see, the last paragraph made really good sense.   

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is ready to change and wants to do it by spring. By change, Saeng wants to feel comfortable in @ LOCATION1 and be able to remember things from where she lived and not have to break down and cry. The author also uses the geese because they have to leave the house at the beginning of the year and they take care of them so that Saeng can take care of them as well.  

<START>

 

The reason the author ends the story with this statement is that when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again. When Saeng fails her driving test, she is disappointed. After failing her test, she went too far into the greenery where she saw the flowers of her native country. So where she bought the hibiscus. It reminded him how different things were. And how things change when you go to a different place. Sometimes they are not that pleasant at first but you get used to them. Like when she first saw the geese flying in a "V". she thought how strange that was. But now he's familiar to her. After failing her driving test, Saeng learns that even if things change, she must be able to try again.          

<START>

 

She concluded the paragraph with this paragraph to show that she is serious about her gardening and that she will not garden until the geese come back.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph they wrote, because Saeng is a freak of nature. So she really loves nature and she would never hurt nature with her life and I guess they wanted to end with a nice paragraph. She must therefore take this test again.  

<START>

 

The author concludes this story because it shows his determination. He says she will continue to try to adjust to her life until she accepts her new home. He also says that as the buds grow, so does she. But she more mentally than physically. And taking the test again means that she is confident in herself, that she will mature and grow up to be someone who regrets her homeland but accepts the new home she is living in. This is why the author has ended thus.    

<START>

 

She says here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes, that she will start a new leaf and that she will do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is not a stopper and that she will try harder. 

<START>

 

Reserved need to check carefully

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the cold was scorching or the author never wanted to be there while the cold was in session. At the time it was really cold         

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One being the fact that she wants to snow out of sympathy for the hibiscus. Another reason would be to show that Saeng wants to make his mother very proud of her. This means that she doesn't want her mom to think she is going to give up. It also contributes to why Saeng believes in herself and truly thinks she can pass the test. Finally, I think this last paragraph shows how much Saeng wants people to know that even plants as small and less important than a plant can help her overcome obstacles and lead her to her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to end the story due to the main fact that we know that Saeng will never stop believing in herself.         

<START>

 

The author of the story chooses to end the story with this sentence because the story mainly tells about how Saeng failed his driving test, but when she saw the hibiscus it reminded her of his home and the helped her feel better. In paragraph @ NUM1, Saeng said, "And that rich, sweet scent - which was familiar too," recounts how beautiful and familiar the flowers were because she recognized the scent. Saeng was already upset to leave her house at @ LOCATION1, then come to @ LOCATION2 and then fail her driving test, only made it worse, but then she saw the flower and it reminded her of her home , so she felt a little better. So when the author uses this quote, they end the story this way to show that she will have enough courage to try again when the flower blooms. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story like this to show the emphasis. Saeng has sworn that this will teach him that everything lives with hope and adaptation. She means that when it all comes back and proves they survive, she will too. She will then pass this driving test. The author also wants to prove that people need to be confident in themselves. You just need to get used to their surroundings. This is why the author has concluded thus.     

<START>

 

In the stories, the author credits them in many different ways with many different effects. In the story, Winter Hibiscus, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a " touching " effect on the reader and it basically sums up all of the paintings that are referred to in the story. The first example, is at the beginning of the conclusion, it says "Saeng has silently dedicated herself to herself". In this unique quote, the author demonstrates the imagery by giving you a mental picture of a lonely, silent girl calming down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote have a moving effect on the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because he summarizes all of the parts covered in the story. “When the geese come back, the hibiscus will bud, I will take this test again.” This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout, geese at the end, and the test failure at the beginning. In conclusion, this is why the author used this paragraph as the conclusion of such a touching story.        

<START>

 

The author concludes in the story that Saeng failed a winter test, and because of his love for the hibiscus plant, spring will help him pass the test.

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed doesn't mean her life is over. She will ask and the same next year.  

<START>

 

The author uses this paragraph to conclude to show that she will retry the test as well as her new environment. For example, the story says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of the things that she once considered strange before had become, through the silent repeat of the season, almost now. Saying that she is getting used to where she is now and that she wants and is ready to give it a chance. Almost as if she didn't think it was so bad that she initially thought it was different and not her house and where she was used to being.    

<START>

 

Maybe the author wrote this as the last sentence or last paragraph because in the story she did something and failed, so she wants to do it again.

<START>

 

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" ends this story with this last paragraph because it sums up all the themes. This shows that Saeng is determined to overcome obstacles and uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adapts to change. The factory "dies" in the winter and this is equivalent to @ PERSON1 not getting her driver's licenses, but the factory will come back, representing determination or adjustment, which is why Saeng says she will come back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle.  

<START>

 

After reading the quote "When they come back, Saeng silently dedicated himself to spring, when the snow will melt and the geese will return and this hibiscus will bud, then I will do this test. From the story" Winter Hibiscus "from Minfong Ho, I think the author is trying to say that after winter and fall, she will be up for the challenge of replanting and feeling good about herself. She lifted her head and looked at their "V" distinctive etching into the evening sky., slowly fading into the distance. Thinking back, I have the impression that Saeng felt the geese secretly letting her know that what she was doing was right.

<START>

 

He ends the story this way to show that she wants and is ready to overcome leaving her homeland. In the story, she goes to a greenhouse. She's in the greenhouse to test herself. She finds a plant from her native country and it reminds her of her grandmother. She finds other plants and they remind her of her homeland and she cries. I think she had a real connection to her grandmother. When they left their home country she probably cried for days, it's like she lost part of her sole.      

<START>

 

The author includes this paragraph in the story because the girl started to give up herself and felt sad that she moved to the United States and also failed her driving test, but finally to About the factory she bought that wasn't real. Also because he wanted to show that her self-esteem had increased and that she was more confident and that she wasn't going to give up. 

<START>

 

The author leaves the story with these words, because it shows the reader a great metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it stands to reason that the "metaphor" compares Saeng and his test to the enduring nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete his test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds and comes back to life. I can relate to that, because I remember going into a triathlon, and my goal was to get first, I put @ NUM1 in the overall standings, then next year came up, and I trained until the triathalon came back, and I placed @ NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and hit my goal.     

<START>

 

The author includes this part in his story because it is about nature and the most beautiful thing is in the natural. There are the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, the tall green grass, the white fence @ CAPS3 and in history there are these types of things that have been in nature. 

<START>

 

The author considers the hibiscus plant to be a new beginning. For example, when she says, "In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again." @ CAPS1 she failed the first time and got the plant the next time she passes it.  

<START>

 

The author included these paragraphs in the story because it is spring when the snows melt and the geese return. I think the author is talking about winter when it snows and continues to snow until spring and then the snow starts to melt because the sun is out. One of the reasons is that the author talks about how he changes the weather when it changes.  

<START>

 

She was angry with herself because she had bought the hibiscus and not the seeds of the plant. So she starts to cry because she remembers how pretty their old one was. It is when the snow melts and the flowers begin to bloom that she repeats the test. The author ended the paragraph like this to show a fresh start next year.   

<START>

 

I believe she included this because she wanted to show that it was important to her. For example, when she says that in the spring she will take the test again. I think she will work harder to make sure she does everything right. So that she can say that she is following through on the things that are important to her. These are my thoughts on why she included this paragraph in the story.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because 1. Saeng failed the test. @ NUM1. It takes time for a hibiscus to bud. @ NUM2. Sounds like a good ending i didn't and plus she wouldn't want to do the test in the snow.    

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let readers know that Saeng @ CAPS1 on hibiscus. I think the author concludes this because he tells the reader that the hibiscus gives saeng good luck and with that good luck she will pass the test. In the story, this tells us how much saeng adores the plant. For example, when she got to the hibiscus, she reached out her hand and gently touched a petal. It was smooth and cool. This is why the author uses this paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng @ CAPS1 and how it gives her confidence.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave readers guessing and wondering what the next step will be. You can say by the tone of the last paragraph, " When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take this test again." " The author seems from the tone of suspense.     

<START>

 

Ending the story of how the author did it in the short story " Winter Hibiscus ," the author offers seang's reader a sympathetic understanding of her struggle to live in another country and her sadness. to wish to go home. I think the author was trying to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to bring the reader back to what he had just read. For example, by repeating the statement on the test saying "I will take this test again," the author gives us this understanding that Saeng has not given up and lets the reader know that she will stand and live strong.    

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she now has something to work for. The author could also have put this concludes the story with this paragraph because she has to wait so long before she can resume it. Saeng could also wait to see the plant grow taller and stronger. These are reasons why I think the author put this conclusion with the paragraph.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She just set a time for her to try again. Saeng wants to be successful in this world and wants to have a good life, so she tries new things  

<START>

 

The “Winter Hibiscus” story is a good day story about a foreign girl trying to adjust to @ LOCATION1. She loves tropical flowers. The reason the author chose to write the last paragraph like this is because he ends the story correctly. This end when the man leaves and the flowers start to grow, she will try to adjust to the spring.   

<START>

 

I think the author used this paragraph for the end because it obviously means fail. Saeng really loves the garden and it is something special for her. Also, when all the snow melts, she 'll take the test and hopfully get her pilots licesies.                                     

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because of new beginnings. What I mean by that is that hibiscus represents new beginnings. She says "When the hibiscus buds, then I'll take the test again." start for it . The flowering of the plant makes her happy and reminds her of her grandmother. She says that by the time spring arrives, she would be ready for a new obstacle, just like the hibiscus plant.               

<START>

 

I believe the author chooses to end the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes the closure. The plant represents his home. But she realizes at the sight of the flying geese that even everyone has to leave the house at some point. She has now accepted what is happening and she will be trying again for her driver's license soon. When the hibiscus buds again, it will be symbolic to her and that is when she will be ready to try again.      

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying that she wants another chance. She has realized her mistake and is ready to start over. Even though she failed trying to grow her hibiscus in the winter, she tries to start over when the @ DATE1 arrives. For example in history. He stated that the "winter hibiscus" was now in the ground and the saeng packed the ground around him above his head, a herd of Canada geese flew in, their weak horns clear and yes familiar to saeng snow. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks it will bring her luck in the test. When she returns to take the test, she will have the comforts of her homeland of hibiscus to encourage her to pass the driver's license. When she retakes the test she will need to pass due to the comforts of home and she will be used to the area being different from her home country. In order for her to pass the test well, she needs something that will help her feel a little more confident. Having things that remind her of the house and the house that she now lives in can help her build confidence a lot.    

<START>

 

She said she was going to take the agen test because to show her mom that she can do it and take it this time. instead of worrying about his old home. 

<START>

 

I think it smacks of hope because she had really missed her homeland and found peace and serenity being around them, she says "That at least she could hang on" meaning the bud I think she was very upset because of the missing house she regretted that her grandmother washed her hair and put a dok mallk in it. I think that since she really had nothing but the flowers that reminded her of her native country, the text said "where was the fine tooth came the hibiscus hedge, the well." her sweet grandma was missing all of these things so I think putting her in that position brought her to a place where not only she misses the people of her country but also misses the beautiful things and how she still somehow has part of the house with her because of the flower.  

<START>

 

In the last paragraph the reason the author uses "when they come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I'm going to do this test. The author uses it because Saeng had finally found solace. After moving from a veelnam to her home country in the United States, she felt bad at home. For example, she comes across this flower that reminds her of the time she has spent in her homeland. She remembers her grandmother's smell because of the plant. So when she finally got home to her mother, she showed her the flower. They both planted the flower, and @ CAPS1 felt a sense of relief. That is why she swore that when the winter was warm and spring came, she would take this test, because she had a sense of belonging in her, which gave her gave courage and strength. It also shows that even when you are in a different area and as you chew, there is always something that can remind you of rest and time spent wherever you can.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story in this way because it shows that she is determined to pass the test. It is also as if the birds could fly south, they could pass this test. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the following paragraph : " When they return, Saeng silently dedicated himself to spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." " The author does for several reasons. The author wants to show you that Saeng still has hope and that she thinks she can fix it. Plus, to show that Saeng will always try to adapt to his surroundings and make new friends. Saeng is also determined to pass the test the next time she takes it. Finally, it focuses on the conflict and how Saeng overcame it.        

<START>

 

I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life goes on. "When the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again", proves that she continues her life and that all the creatures in the world will too. Also, even knowing that she moved to a new country doesn't mean that she can't enjoy things in her native country yet, "but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, preferred it. by far at the Big Mac ". that's why the author put this last paragraph to show that life goes on.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she doesn't really care when they will retake the test, she only worries about the plants she has chosen. Plus, she knows that it will take a long time to retake the test, which gives her more time to study and prepare and concentrate more. The author also ends this article with this paragraph because she wants to let readers know that since she failed the @ NUM1 time, she will be back to pick it up and nothing will stop the author from failing.  

<START>

 

It shows not to give up, it ends almost the same way it started, it shows people shouldn't stay too attached to the past, which is why I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph. This shows that people shouldn't give up because even if she failed her test, she will try to pass it again later. Plus, the story ends the same way it begins when she takes the test or prepares, which is a great way to write. One more thing is this shows that people shouldn't get too attached to the past because if they look at something that reminds them of it, they @ MOIS1 are falling apart, which is why she takes the test, to see if she can look at the familiar flowers without collapsing.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to end on a happy but motivating note. In the story, Saeng says she failed the test and was very disappointed with herself. The test must have been very important to her for her to be so disappointed. The author also probably ended with this paragraph to show that Saeng is dedicated to passing this test. Saeng appears to be a sentimental but reliable person. I believe the test is spending a minimum of money and she wants to earn her mother's respect. This is why taking and passing the test seems so important to Saeng. This is why the author ended with this paragraph.       

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the author concludes the story with the lines "when they return, Saeng silently dedicates himself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that Test again. " The reason the author concludes the test with these lines is that it restores the symbolism of the plant. In the text it is said that the plant buds in the spring, once it has time to grow and adapt to the new environment. Just as the plant needed this time, the main character Saeng needed it. She just moved from Vietnam and failed her driving test. Saeng is very unsure of her new culture. For example, she likes bitter melon, they say. "But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself that she much preferred him to a Big Mac." She seems to think that she is misunderstood and that no one likes her, but just as the plant will adjust to this new life, so too.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story by saying that she will retest the test in the spring and until then will silently dedicate herself because the spring reminded Saeng of her home. In Vietnam, there were a lot of beautiful wild flowers. Sarng goes to the florist to buy a piece of his home. He said that the flower's "leaves quivering in the wind". This shows that the plant was not the same as there were no buds either. She had just failed her driving test before that and needed hope, so I was waiting until spring when the hibiscus will bloom again, which will give Saeng a sense of belonging that gives her hope of pass their driving test.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole world of Saeng is made up of the plants and since they are gone there is no motivation.

<START>

 

In the story " Winter Hibiscus ", the author concludes the story with : " When they come back, Saeng swore in silence, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding. , then I will pass this test again. The author's reasoning for saying this is because the presence of memories of Saeng's homeland comforts her. So much so that she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous. “It was like stepping into another world,” Saeng said, when she walked into the florist, after failing her driving test. It was almost as if she had completely forgotten her failure and was only thinking about plants, flowers. The flowers take her in happy peace and make her feel at home. As if everything was going to be alright. This is why the author concludes with such a sentence because we, the readers, should show memories of his farmland that will help him pass his driving test.                

<START>

 

Author @ MONTH1 concluded the story like this because of the title and the beginning of the story. Or he @ MOIS1 concluded the story like this because he wants to. He @ MONTH1 concluded the story like this to show what is happening @ MONTH1. But is a good conclusion is a good conclusion.   

<START>

 

I really don't know why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Maybe because she started to talk. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's determination. Saeng has been through a lot and misses what it's like at home. She feels different and out of place but she is still strong. Life goes on and this paragraph shows that Saeng moves with her. The paragraph says, "In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again." " Spring comes, because nothing can stop time. The snow will melt because the weather is changing. The geese will return home and the hibiscus will bloom in the spring. Saeng takes a positive look at things and decides to join them. Sure, she failed once, but she's strong and ready to try again. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Saeng will always keep her memories of home, but she is ready to change for her new surroundings. The concluding paragraph shows Saeng's determination to succeed and survive in the New World.            

<START>

 

The author concludes the story by saying this because she wants to show us that Saeng has confidence in her and won't hesitate to take the test again. She walked over to the corner of the vegetable garden and started digging a hole in the ground. 

<START>

 

The author concludes with this paragraph, to make sense of hope and growth. The flower represents Saeng's lobster and comforts her. It connects her to her emotions and reminds her of the way they are. The growth and blooming of the hibiscus corresponds to the blooming of Saeng. When it blooms, she will have a real home away from home, and can take the test again. The story is about overcoming obstacles and adapting to change. The visual and almost lyrical expression of the blossoming hibiscus makes the reward and the result of your struggles "seem so much more beautiful                      

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The start was very negative, with Saeng failing the driving test and his mother yelling at him. But when this sentence arrives, the reader is filled with hope for the young Saeng girl. The author does this to show that Saeng will adapt and persevere when she was so upset, @ CAPS1 when she said, "I failed the test." Then, for Saeng to recast from this event, it gave the reader hope and that's why the author did this.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author talks about how there will be a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test, and in the winter the plant will die in the spring, the plant will bud again and it will retake the test. It's a new chance to start things over again.  

<START>

 

Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring, saeng swore he didn't really like talking. Saeng sometimes liked to be alone. In the spring it was a different story. Saeng loved spring and @ DATE2. She played outside all day every day. Saeng was just a nice girl     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character will try again what he failed. In the story, the character loves gardening, so when her favorite plant returns, she will try again to pass her test. 

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with this, because as winter comes, everything goes. As the trees shed their leaves, the geese fly south and the flower dies. So this passage says that in the spring when everything returns, she will start the ordeal again. it's like starting a new life.   

<START>

 

In the story titled "Winter Hibiscus" the author concludes the story with this paragraph "when they return, Saeng silently dedicates himself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, that I will take this test again. " The reason the author put this at the end of the story was because when things get bogged down everyone wants to wait and wait for it to come back because when you fail it all falls apart but if you wait a bit, it will all start again. raise Just like flowers and whatever else you can think of. That's why the author put this at the end of the story to tell people that it's okay for people to fail. As long as you get up and try again until you reach your goal. So this is what the author was talking about and this is why Minfong Ho put this at the end of the story so that people can read and learn what she is saying.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this last paragraph to set the final mood. The author wanted to show that Saeng will not give up and that she will continue to adapt to her new environment. It made the end of the story warm and also inspiring. The end of the story also encourages the reader not to give up. The last paragraph gives an example of how the reader can also promise to improve. The author knew that the last paragraph would be inspirational and might help a reader navigate something similar to the story.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because for her the plant seems to remind her of her native country which calms her and when she buds she feels stronger. In the story, Saeng is kind of an alien and when she sees the plant, she sees part of her past at home. In the story, it is said that she trembles when she tries to say "home". When she says "and this hibiscus is budding" I think it really means when she's ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it is told how see gets used to geese flying in a "V", so she gets more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again.    

<START>

 

The author includes the paragraph " when they come back ... then I will take this test again ", to show that the hibiscus is a symbol of time. Saeng uses the hibiscus to measure how much time she has left until she resumes her test. The hibiscus also symbolizes the power to overcome difficulties (stay strong). Saeng has had issues with her test, but the hibiscus is there to help her get through to prepare her for the next test. The hibiscus also helps Saeng's mother overcome the difficulties of seeing her daughter sad about not having passed the test. The plant helps the mother try to stay positive and it also helps the mother by trying to do the right thing for her daughter. In history. the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to please her daughter. The hibiscus shows strong symbolism and helps Saeng and his mother stay strong throughout their struggles.           

<START>

 

This last paragraph goes hand in hand with one of the main premises of the story. Do not quite and continue to understand and be happy in this world. Saeng takes this "test" to see if she is ready to change and adapt to her new surroundings. She failed this time. But when all is well and the hibiscus is ready, she will try again to see if she is ready to let go of the old one and be happy with the new.    

<START>

 

she said it because she didn't do what she had to do, so she said she failed. task as a test, so she said next time i would do it right.

<START>

 

I believe the author ended the story with the " test " because it is a big part of Saeng's life or part of his lore.  

<START>

 

There are several reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First of all, this ending gives a lot of emotion, which doesn't make people think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that he shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng states that even if she failed the test the first time, she will retake it. Another reason author @ MONTH1 used this paragraph to end the story is to show people to never give up. It shows how much she failed and her mother was disappointed, but she's not going to give up and retake the driving test. Overall, the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great picture to keep trying and never give up.       

<START>

 

The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how devoted the author and her child are to gardening. I guess the favorite plant for young children is hibiscus. I think a mom and baby's favorite thing to do together would be gardening. It's a great way to end a story. It gives the reading a sort of questioning look on their faces. This leaves them suspicious as to why the author did this. But in my opinion, I think it adds some curiosity to the story.      

<START>

 

The story lines, "Winter Hibiscus," are meant to provide a glimpse into the near future, to show a change in Saeng's attitude. Until this point, Saeng was lamenting his old country and not adjusting well to his new one. The Hibiscus inspires him and lets him know that the new country has a lot of the same things as his old country. In this last line, she comes to terms with her current situation. "When the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus blossoms" is a way of saying that she is going to let some time pass, and by ironing her driver's license, she is going to start her new life.      

<START>

 

The author concluded the story by saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. On her way home from her exam, Saeng saw a familiar flower and chose to delar to a florist. There she saw many flowers which reminded her of her home. she bought a hibiscus and went home. She and her mother planted it, after Saeng realized that the flower could overwinter. She looked up to see many birds flying above her head and realized that she had adjusted to her life at @ LOCATION1. The hibiscus gave her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life at @ LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to make was that the hibiscus gave courage and hope to retake his driving test and continue to survive @ LOCATION1.       

<START>

 

The reason I think the author concludes this story with this last paragraph is that it is about @ CAPS1's passion. And that Saeng is very and will do it every year. She really loves plants and will wait to start over. The last paragraph really showed a lot of dedication. And she really enjoys spring and hibiscus.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and striving to survive and integrate into its non-native lands, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test and be part of her new country. This is supported throughout history when his mother indulges in hibiscus by the deceased. She said, "It's strong enough to get through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus." That's what counts ”(Ho @ NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the struggle of the hibiscus through hard times in a foreign land felt the same way in Saeng's life. The two must be a strong fight in difficult times when no one, "not even her classmates or friends, or Mrs. Lambert" (Ho @ NUM1), understood how lonely and out of place she felt. So just as she swears to take the test again, she promises herself that she will fight through hard times, grow strong, just like her winter hibiscus.       

<START>

 

Mainly why she said that, that's what she said over time, that's the cause. She was basically saying that in a while when things change again, she thinks her performance might change as well. I represented this by the idea that you can tell that she is starting to sit down and misses her house in Vietnam and the memory with the time change is coming. It's a simple aspect of logic that over time comes to chase. But I think just as much as I interpreted the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and ultimately I believed Saeng said this because time brings change.     

<START>

 

The importance of why the author ended this story this way was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country, she does not have much in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought could not give it the strength to do all she can. It is possible that whatever challenge @ MONTH1 the author tries to overcome, the fact that she has the support of the plant will give her the success and confidence to complete her task.   

<START>

 

The author thus concludes the story because hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. The narrator also compares her to returning geese. The Return of the Geese represents her starting over at driving school and starting over. The hibiscus represents it to stay strong in winter and in spring, it builds itself and repeats the test. This is what the narrator chooses to end the story this way.    

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story like this so that he has a spin-off of it. I mean for me, I think that means she's going to try again when spring comes so she and her plant can get a fresh start and I think that's a good way to end it. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with, "When they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." for several reasons. One of the reasons the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that the hibiscus flower will adapt in the spring, just as Saeng should to his new environment in the United States. Another reason is that, like the budding hibiscus, Saeng began to age and become much wiser, which made him come back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Finally, in the text it says: "She realized that a lot of things that she considered strange before had become, through the repetition from season to season, almost familiar to her now." It shows that Saeng is becoming familiar and comfortable now with where she lives, how easily the hibiscus flower adapts to her location and gets used to the seasons.     

<START>

 

The author @ CAPS1 the story with that paragraph because Saeng says that when she @ CAPS2 @ CAPS2 comes back she will take the test again, which means that in test form is that while she was there, it was a service testing and when the story begins it is a test of the beginning and end of the story the test and there leveing and she wants to come back to see what grew. The author also says that you don't know how badly you have it.  

<START>

 

Because the winter hibiscus "was in the ground and Saeng has ground down the ground around him. Above, a herd of Canada geese are passing, their weak horns are clear and -Yes- @ CAPS1 to Saeng now.

<START>

 

The author includes this paragraph in the story because it shows an impression on the work ethic and adapting to a new environment can be difficult. "not even @ PERSON1, looked at it." brings up something he doesn't like for a student who is new, doesn't give him a good work ethic and that will also mentally incent them. Therefore, the girl is uncomfortable and not enthusiastic about working on something that no one would like.   

<START>

 

The author concludes this way because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had already failed. For example, she writes "she silently devoted herself to herself". When you make a vow to do something, it usually means that you are very determined to do something. Everything she says afterwards, she really means. This is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show his dedication to his goal.    

<START>

 

The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with this pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng would finally start to get used to his new home. She won't spend so much time dreaming about her past. "And in the hot and humid shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng collapsed and cried." I think that's what she needed to get on with her life.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to let us know when she will pick it up. When the season changes is when she will resume it. Saeng probably understands why she wants to wait so long. Saeng took a long walk home and stopped at the flower shop. She tried to clear her mind by failing the test. Saeng brought a beautiful flower / plant for @ MONEY1. Her mother was upset at first, then realized that her daughter was not happy and changed her mood.      

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with this because he says she will keep trying and not give up and keep trying. I say this because she has just moved from Vietnam to the United States and is having a hard time adjusting to life in the United States. I think geese are something that is constantly changing environment and when they come she will fly again to get her permit.      

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she now has something to work for. The author could also have put this concludes the story with this paragraph as she has to wait that long before she can take it back so Saeng might want to wait to see the plant grow bigger and stronger. These are the reasons why I think the author put this conclusion with the paragraph 

<START>

 

Saeng would be silently in the spring she will take that up in the right end of this story it was like the goods ended because the story had listed come of bad weather ready and the spring and the plant good weather the spring all as plant is ending because the spring in a near test and to repeat the test of this time, to think that it is a good end because the strong rule concerns the machines saeng and the spring and made is close to the paragraph. This is why it is a good end-to-stay plant.                                            

<START>

 

The author ends with this because of what hibiscus means to saeng. For her, it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and cold of winter, she knows she won't fail either. For her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She will also retake the test when the hibiscus buds as it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. So even if she fails, she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because the factory and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and return in the spring. While Saeng must pass his driving test. Finally, I think the author ended up this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If he survives, she knows that she too will survive and life goes on.          

<START>

 

I believe the author concluded the story with "When they come back saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snow melts and the peacock comes back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take the test again." because it shows the whole theme of the story. The theme of this story is to adapt to the things of life. The conclusion demonstrates this when she says she will take the test again. Hibiscus enabled him to overcome life changes. For example "The familiar scent filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost smell the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair." The hibiscus was something of the house that gave him fond memories. To do it better.     

<START>

 

The author probably concludes the story this way because this is when Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and his mother moved from Vietnam, where winter hibiscus is popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text this way because it reminds Saeng of Vietnam and how she feels better this time of year. When she said "And next to it was yet another old friend." She feels that this plant is a friend to her and that she feels more comfortable. This is why the author ended the story the way she did.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this saying because it will be a new beginning and it will be spring and beauty. "@ CAPS1 crashes now" tells me she wants another try. She wants a fresh start and will come spring when all of her lovely flowers bloom and get to where she wants her now to have the best chance.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of her sadness for what she did. The test she was talking about was how she was supposed to use the twenty dollars they had and buy one. Big @ CAPS1 that she spent the most money after to buy a plant that reminded her at home and this last paragraph says that when she gets a chance to do the "test" again, she will do what she is supposed to do       

<START>

 

After reading “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho. I believe Ho ended the story with this paragraph to support his idea of overcoming obstacles. After failing her driving test, Saeng was very upset and did not know if she would ever pass it. But after seeing a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her home in Vietnam which inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive. But, after seeing how the plant brought joy to Saeng, his mother forgave him. The last time saeng dug a hole for the hibiscus to grow, it inspired Saeng to retake the test as she overcame the obstacles of bringing the plant home and letting it grow. Therefore, I think Ho finished “Hibiscus Winter”, to go along with his idea of overcoming obstacles.         

<START>

 

The last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus reminded her that her "home" was her old life, but @ CAPS1 is missing in her new life. She gains determination by remembering this. She soon realizes that she is at home, as things have become familiar to her, like the V-shaped geese. She loved her old home, but realized it was time to move on. The last paragraph doesn't just mean taking a driving test again, it symbolizes the determination to embrace your new home and new life.      

<START>

 

I will do this test again. She has the confidence @ CAPS1 Hibiscus and snow. When the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding. Then she will start growing with the hibiscus again, so overall she is @ CAPS2 to be confident enough for the test.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The phrase means that when spring comes and the snow might melt, the plants will be out and bud, but by the next class or the next school year, he will come out and be brave and retake the test. This is what the sentence means to the story and how it can be compared to the two things in different ways.   

<START>

 

The last paragraph, "the winter Hibiscus" by @ CAPS1 Ho reads "When they come back, Saeng has vowed silently to her - even in the spring, when the snow background and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, so I will take this test again. This paragraph compares her to flowers, which shows that she is tough as the flower is strong, she is determined to retake the test next year and pass it. She would also do the test because it comforts her and reminds her of home                                                                                    

<START>

 

He ended the paragraph like that because he @ MONTH1 wants you to keep reading, or he might show you the comparison between flower and Saeng. “When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again,” The quote shows the flower can fight through the winter and come back. Saeng failed the test once and will now retake the test. Which shows that they both have the moderation and integrity to come back.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph: "When they return, Saeng silently devoted himself to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." I believe that the author concluded the story thus because it shows that the hibiscus represented for Saeng a new beginning and to start again what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it comforted her in a time of disappointment, connecting with her past experiences and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, " When the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again ", It implies a fresh start so the hibiscus represents Saeng. That's why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.     

<START>

 

The last line is included in the story "Winter Hibiscus" because it shows the connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed her driver's license the first time around, she decides to retake it in the spring. The hibiscus flower like Saeng is out of place and will have to go through winter until spring to be able to bud again. This shows how well Saeng's flower will bud again in the spring when taking the driving test again. Another reason is that the saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions of @ LOCATION1. So they both have to face the winter months to which they are not used. This again shows how the last line connects the girl and the flower. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to conclude the story with a connection between the flower and Saeng.       

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this statement because he is determined to get used to the new country and its surroundings. In the story, the author shows homesickness. The author sees a plant that knows where it came from and buys it for more @ NUM1, his mother couldn't believe it. She didn't want to tell her mom exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again. The last sentence shows that the author is trying to adapt.    

<START>

 

The author concludes with this paragraph because he / she wanted to close the story with a conclusion that depicts the story. The author has referred to the hibiscus in the story as a "comfort in times of distress", a hobby, or something she enjoys doing with her spear time. In conclusion, the author concludes with this paragraph for the reasons stated in @ ORGANIZATION1  

<START>

 

The author ends the story with the paragraph given to pass on. He highlights the important and familiar things to saeng that have comforted her, and uses them to basically say that she will retake the test once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that Saeng remembered from home life to history. So when she sowed the plant, "a wave of loss so deep and so strong that it stung saeng's eyes has now swept over her." Saeng couldn't comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the last paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void and help saeng try to retest. She also mentions geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, "through the silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar to her now." Saeng mentions it so she can get used to the weird and unfamiliar aspects of her life and to deal with her failed test. Therefore, when mentioning the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar, foreign and domestic objects to illustrate her awareness of her failure.           

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it expresses the meaning of the story. Life goes on no matter what, the hibiscus will return in the spring. The hibiscus is like a symbol of Saeng's life. The plant does not normally survive through the winter months, but this one did. Mother said, "These flowers are not so pretty, but they are strong enough to spend the winter months here ..." Saeng and her mother are like the plant. They are strong and their life will continue even if they are in a new environment The author has chosen to end the story with this parragraph because even though it says the hibiscus will return every spring the deeper meaning is that Saeng and his mother, like hibiscus, will continue to live their lives.             

<START>

 

The author chooses to end the story in a very deep and connected way. It ends on a note of rebirth and second chance. when Saeng swears, "when the return, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back, when the hibiscus blooms, I will take the test again," The author connects the meaning of a new country and a second chance and Renaissance. Spring and snowmelt could be linked to rebirth, while the return of geese could symbolize a second chance. This is related to saeng's second chance. The author also shows that saeng is getting used to the new country, which shows a sense of hope.It shows that there is hope for his test.  

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morale out of the story. I said this idea because in the story he talks about orchids, lannos bushes, oleanders, elephant-eared begonias, and vire bougainvillea surrounded him. He tells how these flowers surrounded him to test her. From her @ CAPS1.   

<START>

 

I think the author concludes this in the story because. This is key information for this story. Because. This is his mother. She enjoys working the garden and becoming a garden and having a real job. Like her mom     

<START>

 

Saeng thinks she failed because she misses her grandmother. The hiscubus plant she buys reminds her of grandmother's scent. Saeng spent more than @ MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant. She needed it to feel a little more at home. Saeng believes that she had very little time to leave her country, "in the blink of an eye". Her grandmother wants her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her. Saeng must think well and smile when she remembers her past. Saeng wants to pass the test. the next time the hibiscus is budding, she must not cry.        

<START>

 

The reason I think the author did this is because I wanted you to know what time it happened and what the weather was like so that also tells you how long she will wait until. 'till the snow melts and it's gonna be during and when the geese live and come home, that's why I think she tells you how it is.

<START>

 

I think these are tall, lush winter hiliscus and hedpe that surrounded their garden with its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion blossoms. She said as she reached the hibiscus, she reached out and gently touched a petal.

<START>

 

The reason the author finished the story the way she did was to leave the reader to the last word. It also symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says: "... this hibiscus is budding ..." (Ho @ NUM1). She also describes that they will start again in the spring. And that leaves the reader with the last thought on Saeng, and how she overcame life in the new place. Finally, it ties the feelings and experiences of @ CAPS1 all the time she has moved, "... I'll take the test again" (Ho @ NUM1), which tells the reader that she will keep trying her new home. In conclusion, the reason for this quote being the last paragraph is to show that Saeng will continue to try to overcome ??? (NON WORDS @ CAPS2)       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants there to be hope for the future, as the hibiscus budding in spring is what Saeng expects. This gives her hope that she will be able to pass this test again. It shows when she says ".. and this hibiscus is budding, so I'll take this test again," @ CAPS1 in the winter Saeng hopes she gets better and when the hibiscus buds she will know it's time to try again. Saeng sees spring as a new beginning. So that means it is time to overcome her stubbornness. I think that stubbornness or that test might be not to cry when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she grows like hibiscus              

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one main reason.

<START>

 

The author shows that Saeng wants to continue his mother's gardening. To take up the traditions of an elder and what his mother started. 

<START>

 

I believe the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe so because at the beginning of the story, as she walks home, she states that she failed the driving test. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over, she will retake the test when her hibiscus blooms. Her perseverance allows her to go through life as if she were a plant trying to survive the winter.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph because she wants to do it right next time. What is said is that she can try every year to do things right to impress her mother. In conclusion, what I have to say about the paragraph  

<START>

 

 In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the author @ CAPS1 probably ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she considers the hibiscus to be more than a flower, for Saeng it is also a memory . For Saeng, winter hibiscus are like story books, waiting to be read just by smelling the flower, it releases wonderful memories of the precious time spent with his “sweet grandmother” since his first home. @ CAPS1 tries to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, a thought, etc. The last sentence makes it clear, with evidence from history, that Saeng cares deeply about her past and in order for her to adjust to life today, she must not forget who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden, she can have fond memories of who she comes from. Therefore, it is believed that this reasoning is the hypothesis of why @ CAPS1 ended the story " Winter Hibiscus " with the selected paragraph.                     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. For example, it shows a feeling of hope, when she says "this hibiscus is budding". This indicates a new beginning or a start over. I think that's the idea the author is trying to get across. to adapt to his new country. For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus was not the same as the one in her native country. Even though she feels hostalgic, this paragraph reassures the reader that the author is ready to give her new country another chance. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph indicates that " when they return ... I will take the test again " (Ho @ NUM1). Already upset that he failed his driving test, the main character is upset about missing his homeland. The flower buds give her hope and essentially the strength to retake the test. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, "A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes has now swept over her ... and in the hot and humid shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and cried "(Ho @ NUM2). It is obvious that for the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they bring her back to her country of origin, from which she was brutally torn and which she misses, they give her hope and remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it is what matters most to the main character.           

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show that she loved flowers. That they have met a lot for her. When she failed her driving test, she was sad. And the flower made her feel better. now that the snow is failing, she waits for spring for them to rise and she will have faith and retake the test.    

<START>

 

The author concluded this sentence because he was letting everyone know that Saeng would go back to the hibiscus and take care of it again, and that she had not forgotten it.

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", by Minfong Ho, a teenager, Saeng, leaves Vietnam for the United States. She later takes a driving test, but fails to pass, but manages to find solace in her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph says, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take this test again." The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. That being said, Saeng was very upset that she had failed her test and remembered her homeland and the changes she had to adjust to during this move. The hibiscus gives Saeng hope to continue his journey even when the going gets really tough. Winter is this time of turmoil and sadness for plants, as Saeng's period of turmoil and sadness fails this test and is not at home. The end of winter gives both the Factory and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope to start over, Saeng will easily go through hardships if she continues to find solace in her past.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to get readers to ask questions. To show that she's not going to give up on what she wants to do. 

<START>

 

Author Minfong Ho ends the story by talking about the test that Saeng failed and swearing to take it again because, as in the story, the test symbolized a slight movement, just starting his new life and not living in it. 'Ancient. But Saeng couldn't do that. She bought the flower with all her money because she kept memories for herself. But I think as the story goes, she realizes that she can have both, her old and her new life. I think she ends the story this way because she really wants to try again. She wants to be able to please her mom, and she herself wants to be able to move on and start her new life.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because saeng says she needs more time. If she takes a break and does what she needs to do, she @ MONTH1 can pass the test.      

<START>

 

Closing the story this way because he can now expand that story by creating a sequel about Saeng's success. Also end the story this way, the author now shows Saeng a limit and now she will stop at nothing until her test is over. Saeng has difficulty adapting to her new way of life because the plants and the old luteria she had are no longer present. In the story, Saeng's determination is shown when her mother finds out that she spent @ NUM1 dollers to have a simular factory. The mother responds by saying that their whole garden is worth less than @ NUM1 dolls.    

<START>

 

This sentence concludes the passage, to show how when the hibiscus buds and a new season begins, Saeng will be a new person and can pass the test. In this sentence, cold snow, runaway geese, and planted hibiscus can all represent Saeng and what she's going through. They are either cold, ready to go, or restricted, as Saeng feels. But, when a new season begins, the geese return, and the hibiscus is no longer confined to a pot, Saeng will also grow taller and be able to pass the test. This sentence is put at the end to show how much Saeng can now grow taller because she has the hibiscus, which grows with her.

The author ends the story with the sentence provided because it said that when you and winter are there, it will again be time to go back gardening proof with the plant she had. planted.  

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with a paragraph about having Saeng retake the test another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to repeat the test when the snow melts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that moment arrives. Saeng tries to tell herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she has more time to prepare for the test, she will retake the test. I think that's why the author wrote the concluding paragraph.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because when the hibiscus has started to bud, it will give him inspiration to try again to pass the test. In order to pass the test, she wanted to feel at home, and have memories of her home to encourage her to try again. Therefore, this is the reason why the author concludes the story with the last paragraph.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with a paragraph repeating the test to show that narrator @ MOIS1 is upset to be in a new place, but she will keep trying. The narrator gets angry when she knows that the hibiscus is not like the one in her old house. This upsets her because she is probably missing things that she was used to before. The author uses this paragraph to show that the narrator is strong and will not give up doing things the way they were, but also to show that she will try to adjust to her new home. The author does this to show that you should keep trying something you like. The narrator will continue to try when the geese fly away and the hibiscus is budding. So the author says to try if you fail and set goals for yourself never to give up.      

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows he failed the test and he says that when spring returns he will be ready to take the test. I know it's spring because it's sad when the snow melts.

When she moved to America, she saw all the beautiful flowers that were in the spring, she saw a flower that caught her eye, her name was hibiscus. She felt that she might go to the florist to see if they had it. Whenever she could they were growing in the wild, springing from cracks in ceizors walls, the flower reminded her of her grandmother her long, freshly washed gray hair

In monfong Ho's “winter Hibiscus passage”, the quote “when they come back Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and the hibiscus bud, I will do the test again, it symbolizes @ CAPS1 new trip to the new country in which she lives. In the test, Saeng has a personal gap, missing her homeland @ CAPS2, she states "I failed the test." This test meant more than his failure. She was a test for her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The quote "when they came back ..." started above can be analyzed in depth as the snow being its obstacles and the hibiscus itself. When the obstacles clear and she becomes a new, stronger person, she will retake the test.    

<START>

 

She will go back to where she started. It's a circle and she'll be back next year where she started.

I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph. “When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” because that budding would give him confidence in everything. . The reason I think it is because this flower reminds him of memories of his homeland past. It is as if she has a little corner of the house in her new home. An example that represents this is " Not like the kind we had before ", this explains that the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one in the house, so it reminds him of the house. This is the reason why I believe the author ends the story the way they do,       

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng isn't just going to give up. She will overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the whole story is about overcoming issues and if Saeng gave up it would ruin the story. But just as she was able to leave her home country, she will eventually pass the test. The mother also managed to overcome some obstacles. Like moving away from your homeland and having to plant all the new plants. He obviously misses the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she's able to handle it just like Saeng will on her test next time.

Everything in history is about to change. Winter will turn into spring, the snow will melt and disappear, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will change and also ripen, Saeng is like the hibiscus because the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and has to adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant is different in the United States than in Vietnam because it has matured and grown. This is what Saeng has to do, she has to mature and grow in this new country. For example, Saeng observed how different the plant looked in a store window and in its country of origin. She was observing herself and how different she looked too. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had already matured and to put it at the end to show that she had grown. Putting it in the beginning would not give the same effect. The hibiscus plant has been able to endure the change of harsh winters. Saeng is also able to do this and she has made a silent vow to take this test again when she matures, as are the things around her.         

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph indicated for several reasons. First of all, the author should conclude the story without leaving any questions in the minds of the readers as to what is going on. This is achieved by incorporating geese, hibiscus and its pilots in the last paragraph. Then this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is made to retake the driving test through memories of Vietnam, finally this adds to the character by saying that she will "take this test again", she is shown to be realistic and not too consistent. These are some of the ways the last paragraph improves the story.     

<START>

 

The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to adjust to her new home and that she will not give up. You can tell that she still misses her homeland by her reaction to the sight of the hibiscus plant, but also that she is getting used to her new home because of the way she recognizes geese and will take the decision to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns. 

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng was not prepared for this test, as she was not used to the place, but after seeing the plants that reminded her of her home, and knowing that spring is the time to bloom, she will be ready to take the test.

<START>

 

The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to state that the flower season is over and should be postponed until spring in order to give the author a point where he can end the story and start a new one for. when the flowers come back in spring, therefore, this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph they have chosen.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with "When they come back Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will do this test again". To show that Saeng is going to retake the test and not give up. This is shown by saying, "then I will take this test again". It shows that she hasn't given up and wants to try again.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of its connection to when Saeng failed his driving test. But she was determined to take over when she felt it. ready and the sad paragraph "in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will do this test again."  

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus" which was written by Minfong Ho. I believe she put it there because it makes you ask questions. I think because her mom was so disappointed with her that maybe she can turn things around and make things better.  

<START>

 

The author ends the story by saying, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take the test again." she chooses to end this way to show the change of mood throughout the story. When she comes home, her mother "noticed the tears on her daughter's cheeks and her swollen eyes." Saeng felt sad and out of place at the start of the story, but at the end, she felt happy and upbeat.   

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the winter hibiscus story with this paragraph for these reasons. The first reason is to show that the girl will not give up. She was crying in the store and was just very depressed. But she knows she has to keep going. It shows a sense of determination. Another reason why I think the author made it the last paragraph is as follows. It showed her that she was getting used to her surroundings. I think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows about the new country and put them together. That way she gets hope from both. For example, in the article, it says "a lot of things that she once considered strange had become… almost familiar to her now." It shows that she realizes that she is used to the arrangement right now. So she takes hope out of it. Also, I think the author did this to add a positive effect to the story. That's why I think the author wrote this in the last paragraph.              

<START>

 

The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that history or people in history have a soft spot for nature or like to write about nature like what changes in nature or maybe this story talks about nature at its best.

<START>

 

The author wrote this last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng remembers his old country and feels sad. Saeng buys the flower and talks about it with his mother at home. The flower reminds him of the house but it also gives him inspiration. That's why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom.    

<START>

 

The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits with much of the story and sums it up well. In history, the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. In the course of the story, she tells many memories to the hibiscus. It reminds him of his home and his past and therefore plays an important role. When she plants it, it is winter and the hibiscus has not yet flowered. So to say that she will retest when it buds is like saying that she will retest when it buds again. It acts in much the same way as the flower, once again showing its importance. And that's why I think the author has finished with this paragraph.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he says that she cannot work in the garden in winter, but “when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding”, are all signs of spring. In the spring, she will retake the test; which implies that she will be working in the garden.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story like this @ CAPS2 the author (Minfong Ho) tells you what will happen in the spring. I @ CAPS1 this @ CAPS2 the text says Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again. This means that in the spring the hibiscus will be @ CAPS3.  

<START>

 

because she thinks she will do better in spring for some reason not sure if @ CAPS1 because then she will be in a better mood and it will be more like her home

<START>

 

The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes Saeng's decision to try again. Things in nature are repetitive, seasons change but eventually reappear, geese migrate but they too come back and the author has used this as a comparison to Saeng's decision to try his license again. Like Saeng, the winter hibiscus was out. As a normal environment but was learning to adapt and this inspired Saeng to keep trying even if she failed because the hibiscus was trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place.   

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because know what she said or did she have to heel the flower because it reminds her where she lived and how she was there, so she started to cry and the test was not to buy the flower and not to cry and that in the spring she will grow her own flower. This is what I think the test is about. 

<START>

 

She will see if her plant will survive the winter, just like the ones at home. Same. 

<START>

 

It is the start of a new life. She has a new new school and a new plant, it's like she has some connection with the plant, when she grows up she becomes stronger and more confident. That's when she said that when they come back when the hibiscus is budding, she will be ready for this test.  

<START>

 

The author ends thus because it shows that she will not give up and that she will give her new country a chance. She ends with that to say that she will be strong as a flower and that she will remain so no matter what! That she'll be there, there, to see him grow back. That's why I think she concluded on this.   

<START>

 

All along this story gives us general information on a girl missing deferately his true home when we introduced young Saeng, it is in the shop of a flourist just looking at flowers, one learns quickly that it is not only look at the flowers, but looking for a piece of her home and her past, she then buys a hibiscus which is a flower native to her vietnam. After finding out that she had just failed a test, it becomes more apparent that purchasing the flower is a way to cope with her new situation at @ LOCATION1 and to feel comforted by her past. The author is able to conclude the story with this statement because it is about moving forward without clinging to the past, In the spring, saeng will have a new home and find strength in his past, that's what I think the last paragraph suggests                

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is determined to pass the test. She knows when it is spring and the hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. I think she wants to take the test again because the hibiscus reminds her of her native country. It makes her more confident. She thinks she can pass it next time. The hibiscus makes her happy and overwhelmed. She wants to take the test again. She's sure she'll do better next time.                                   

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that if this type of flower can bloom in different places and undergo natural changes, then neither can it. For me, the flower is a symbol for the author who encourages him to keep trying. It doesn't matter if you have to start all over and start over. It is just this time that you will know and would have learned from past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms in a spring, it dies in the winter and returns in the spring. It's the same as Saeng's failure on that test that year, she can go back next time and take it again.      

<START>

 

I guess she says when the winter is gone, she will prepare again for this winter test. Guess it's because they weren't prepared for the coming winter while they were planting. As in the reading, she said: “As if she was unaware of the cold, her mother was still in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. That's why I thought they were not prepared for winter.  

<START>

 

The author concluded the story this way so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things Saeng and his family were going through during this difficult time. The reader feels sympathy for Saeng, as all she can think of to make herself feel better is her hometown and the way she was taken. 

<START>

 

He concludes the story because there was another chance to pass the test.

<START>

 

The author concluded "Winter Hibiscus" with this paragraph to highlight new life and new opportunities for the main character. The future frame of the paragraph, spring, symbolizes rebirth and a new beginning from the cold and harsh winter. The author takes this to heart, including other events that reinforce this symbolized meaning. the author uses structured choices to convey his thoughts. To recreate, when to convey the theme of rebirth, the author uses words like "the return of the baby" and "redo the test" which add importance to the house. Also, the literal “ hibiscus is sprouting ” rebirth action @ CAPS1. In winter, the plant is dormant and less colorful, but in spring, the plant is reborn thanks to the color of its buds. The author finally expresses the theme of rebirth by ending with this paragraph.         

<START>

 

In the story “ Winter Hibiscus ” by Minfong Ho, she tells the story of a girl who has just moved to a new country and is struggling to adapt to the new land and its people. But I think the author put this quote at the end to make you believe that you should never give up, that there is a new beginning and you will get there. I believe it because Saeng said to himself, "almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of things she had previously thought strange had become to her, thanks to the silent repetition season after season, almost familiar." This shows that he has finally found solace and is confident, like the geese that will adapt to a new area and then return, and the new winter hibiscus gives up and will continue to live in the new weather conditions each time. season.     

<START>

 

She concludes things at the end of her paragraph, she says it all, that means she will look at it when winter is over. She will be able to take the test again in the spring. This is what she wrote  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new environment. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring, she will feel better and more comfortable while remembering her old life in a new place. In the story, it is said that she failed her test and then bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and this helped comfort her. Spring reminds him of his old life as the flowers in the garden bloom, the geese come back and the snow has melted. Saeng feels like she could adjust to her new surroundings with the comfort of her memories of her old life.      

<START>

 

The author chose this paragraph because it matched well as a good conclusion showed e.g. the word again it means you have already done something and it's over but you miss so you try again what you miss but in the paragraph he talks about nature and how they want to test it! ("again") !.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined Saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time around. By ending this story with the paragraph that the author creates suspense, it is probably for the continuation of another story. 

<START>

 

In the short story "Winter Hibiscus", a young Vietnamese girl moves to @ LOCATION1 and fails the driving test. After she decides to spend the money on a winter hibiscus to remind her of her homeland, the end paragraph, "who troy returns, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding , then I will do the test show a deep feeling towards nature, she feels like when the geese are ready to come home and when the hibiscus is ready to bud, she too and she will pass the driving tests again. 

<START>

 

She talks about the flowers and wins she says test I think she means what she looks like and examines the flowers and sees the snow fall. Looks like the author is someone who really likes to bloom or maybe just this hibiscus and how it pairs up. Maybe she's just someone who likes to see change.    

<START>

 

I believe the author is adding this passage to the story to represent determination and @ LOCATION1. Although Saeng is not from @ LOCATION2, she is determined and ready to give it a try. adapt to our @ CAPS1. While the winter was cold and harsh in many ways for her, spring will bring forgiveness and relief from her @ CAPS2. She will try again to take the driver's license to perfect herself in @ CAPS1 America, while the flowering of Hibiscus will bring her @ CAPS4 home.    

<START>

 

The author likely concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng realized that she needed to be confident and to end the story on a high note. Additionally, the author sums up things familiar with Saeng and things native to his new home in the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the young girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and she missed her home very much. "A wave of loss so deep and so strong that it stung Saeng's eyes has now swept over her." But once she gets home and tells her mom that she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after planting the hibiscus, she sees geese and feels like they are "almost familiar". The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying its past (the hibiscus), its present (geese and snow), and the drama of the story (if you fail the test) into one.      

<START>

 

She wanted to learn and do more things. She loved the way the plants looked at the store. Her mother took the plant, came home, and they started planting it. The girl really liked the plant. And she said next year I would grow such a wonderful plant as the one her mother was growing.    

<START>

 

I think the author concludes this paragraph of this story to describe how much Saeng has grown now, as it looks like she's not going with her mother anymore. The author probably wants to point out reader @ CAPS1 from Saeng now because she is probably leaving since she is no longer leaving with her mother. What happened was only his past and will be memorable for Saeng.  

<START>

 

The author uses this passage to end the story to show that Saeng will try to adopt. When Saeng smells of hibiscus “The familiar scent filled her lungs and Saeng [she] could almost smell it. The light sounds of his grandmother's long gray hair "This @ CAPS1 that Saeng was looking for things that were familiar to him and reminded him of his homeland. The fact that Saeng paid over nineteen dollars for a plant too @ CAPS1 how much she missed her homeland. ”dd failed the test Saeng paid for.” @ CAPS1 the drive she tried to adapt to her new home but failed. It makes her sad and makes her miss the way things were before. at the end of the story, she said "I [it] will delay further testing." see the hibiscus and familiar geese leave knowing they will return gives hope to Saeng. the last time in history @ CAPS1 respect they @ CAPS2 will always remember his homeland        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up.

<START>

 

With the hibiscus around Saeng, she will have more courage and will also have had more time to adjust to their new home. For Saeng, the hibiscus is like a motivation and it reminds him too. From his old homeland. The reason I think the author chose to end the story with the particular commentary is to show that Saeng has finally found the courage and is ready to accept his duties in this foreign land.    

<START>

 

The story concludes this paragraph because it tells you that there are as many changes in the weather and the seasons as there are in your life. That you sometimes have to deal with changes in your life. The test could be a test to see if she can understand herself. There are weather changes all the time, there are changes in spring and fall, which you just got over.   

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus" by minfong Ho, the authors end with a paragraph that concludes the story. One of the reasons she concluded with the last paragraph the @ CAPS1 she made is because it tells the reader that Saeng @ CAPS1 has not given up on her test drive. "… Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." This explains in more detail when she will take the test. Still years later, that's because it leaves the reader thinking about how the rest of the story will play out.        

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with "When they come back Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again", was one a. great way to end it because i think she sees how much the hibiscus can withstand so she can pass just about anything, mainly the test. Also when her mother said "You what?" "Her mother looked at her in disbelief." She might also have understood that if her mother could get over her anger then she would be upset with the test.   

<START>

 

Le writes this conclusion at the end of the story because he wants people to know that the season is changing and the flowers will die. He also wants you to know that when the season changes, the flower will try to adjust again with the other flowers. that's what the author means when he talks about taking the test again.  

<START>

 

The hibiscus flower is considered a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees him at the florist, she is overcome with memories of his home and how all the flowers grew there freely. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and his mother to do the same at @ LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, as they have moved to a new country. Saeng seems to use it as a motivation when she says "when this hibiscus blooms, I will retest". The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is a great ending note.     

<START>

 

the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he says that if you fail the first it is always a second time just like the @ CAPS1 I die in winter and he comes back alive in spring.

<START>

 

The author leaves us at the end of the story by saying "when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, then I will take the test again." The author is said that because the daughter Saeng failed the test but still found something that reminded her of her home. She was happy, but the plant was not exactly like the one back home. But she got used to it. The @ MONTH1 flower is not the same but it is an @ CAPS1 flower and it gets used to being @ LOCATION1. When she returns to take the test, she will be ready and so will her plant. His plant will be full of life.      

<START>

 

I think the author ends the story like this because of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a simple part of her house, but also as a symbol of good luck. In the text she is holding the plant at a very high value, after paying @ NUM1 coins for it. So I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng thinks the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing.  

<START>

 

The author includes this paragraph at the end of the story because it relates Saeng to the geese and the plant with symbolism. For saeng, the snow represents her difficulties in adapting to @ LOCATION1, the geese show her that she is adapting even now to her new homeland when she seems familiar. The @ CAPS1 hibiscus was pretty but the new @ CAPS2 hibiscus, which has symbolized it since arriving at @ LOCATION1, is adopted to the resilient mother and resists snow which symbolizes her problems adapting to @ LOCATION1. For saeng, the budding hibiscus again represents her getting stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to repeat the test when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to connect the budding Hibiscus with Saeng overcoming his obstacles.     

<START>

 

The author chose to end the story like this because she says it's not over and she will take the test again. In the story, Saeng says, " I failed the test, " so she is determined to go back when the flower blooms again to make things right.   

<START>

 

I think what the author is trying to say is that she will retake her driver's license in the spring when the flowers are out because it will relax her more. The flowers put the author in a relaxed state of mind where she can concentrate. 

<START>

 

Because she says that when the @ CAPS1 grows back, she will be @ CAPS2 to retake the test.

<START>

 

In minfong Ho's story “ winter hibiscus ”, the author concludes the story with this last sentence because it shows everyone that the seasons are over for plant growth, but when will the time come for them? flowers to start growing again, she will be back to take care of the plants because it is her favorite and this is what she lives for now that she has to take care of them. Also, the author probably put the story's conclusion like this to get people to read more of the story later because you get caught up in the suspense because you don't know if it will really return to the stories. plants or just about them. another reason i think the author ended it is because it's still snowing she cares about the plans but she won't care until it is the right time again . For example, she says "when they come back I'll take the test again", it shows that she isn't giving up on anything she loves and will keep trying until she gets it.     

<START>

 

In the story "The Winter Hibiscus", I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although memories of her old country would still be with her, she will soon adjust to her new one. From time to time, she will still show him around his old country. For example " when the show melts and the geese come back ", The last sentences, then I will take the test again ", This sentence means that once she is adapted to this country, she returns to her old country will always enjoy their in any event.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng will retake the test when all of these things happen. Saeng shows that she is not going to give up and that she will keep trying. The hibiscus is a lucky charm for her to keep during the test to encourage her to pass the test. Besides, the author also concludes the story with this paragraph to show her personal thoughts and what she thinks about this test. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, it indicates it is time to retry the test.

In 'Winter Hibiscus', the author concludes with Saeng by saying' I'm going to take this test, again that means Saeng will be ready as soon as spring comes and his hibiscus is all in bloom. When Saeng bought the hibiscus, she was sure that as soon as the winter passes with the arrival of spring, she is sure that taking the driving test will again be easier to overcome fear and moments of mourning in a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome his fear of a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome his fear of a new place. Saeng is also sure that the memories of his homeland will help him too. Ultimately, it revealed that Saeng has grown strong and has high hopes for her success in her new homeland.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows his determination. In the spring it will be difficult for the hibiscus to survive as it is a winter hibiscus and it also has determination.

I believe the author used this statement to end the story because in the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, it also shows that she appreciated her new surroundings. The plant that Saeng bought from his mother said that “ she is strong enough to get through the cold months here ” @ CAPS1 This is telling Saeng if the plant can survive the harsh conditions then maybe you can survive in the harsh conditions. a new country. When Saeng realized that things were repeating themselves season after season, she must have believed that she could do it too and face the driving test again.

The author includes this last paragraph in the story, "Winter Hibiscus" to show that the main character still has hope and has not given up on his new lifestyle. As the story unfolds, the main character Saeng recalls her not-so-distant memories of her birthplace in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant in her country. This is important in the story as Saeng is still not happy to move to @ LOCATION2 and she starts to cry on her way home, after buying the plant, to her mother. "A wave of loss so deep and so strong that it stung Saeng's eyes has now swept over her." Saeng's mother understood how she felt and she was also not disappointed that she failed her driving test. Her mother helped Saeng feel better by immediately planting the familiar hibiscus in the garden. The last paragraph of the story gives the reader hope that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life at @ LOCATION2 that she is not used to. " When the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I'll take this test again." " It's like Saeng had sworn that with time she would be happy for his new life, not just to pass a driving test. The winter hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while remembering his old life in Vietnam.

Author MiNfoNg Ho concluded the story with "When they come back SaeNg silently swore to himself, IN SPRING when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will retake the test because when the plant will start to bloom, she @ MOIS1 feels more confident and at ease. You can sometimes see how she is trying to adjust to a new environment. I believe hibiscus represents comfort in times of disappointment and a connection to her past experiences. Comfort in times of disappointment is the reason she went out and bought the plant. So when she springs up again and the hibiscus is fully blossomed, that's why she remakes the test because she will feel more comfortable in and with her environment, which is why author MiNfoNg Ho concluded the story the way he did.

The past experiences of our lives often influence things in our life, whether we consciously know it or not. In this story, Saeng tries to go to the florist and pass the test of not buying the cestain flower that reminds her of her house, when she fails. She tries to overcome the fact that she is not "at home", that things and people that were once ground are no longer. But there are new things she is getting used to. I think the author ends the story with the paragraph he did, to show that you can always change. She tries to remember the things that make her used to it , and over time, she might be able to do it by next year, because there's always possible to do something if you really want to do it, and l 'author is showing that Saeng really wants to pass her own mental test, so that she can adapt more to the change, her mother will be proud of her.

I think she was like that to say hey I didn't go over anything and will be back next year to retest like the hibiscus that buds when it melts snow and the geese come back @ CAPS1 year.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test again.

The authors chose the last paragraph of the short story : “ Winter Hibiscus shows the hope for the future that seang feels.

Saeng finds solace in the memories of his homeland. When she took this test, everything was not familiar to her, so she failed, but on the way home, something familiar found her. Native plants of his house. " There, in a ray of the pale light of the afternoon sun, there was a single blood-red flower," "" "floating in the bucket. “ Saeng needs familiar things to comfort herself. So when she sees geese, and it symbolizes change.” Like geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched.

The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the following paragraph : " When they returned saeng silently swore to themselves, in the spring when the snowmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will pass by again. this test ”.

I think the author has tried two, say the coming weaning of snowmelt like @ MONTH1 they will come back. The author will be because in the spring sometimes wrote a new book.

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" uses this paragraph to conclude his story because it is a symbol of the future of saeng. Winter Hibiscus is a symbol of saeng for many reasons. On the one hand, saeng and the plant are from Vietnam and both are struggling to survive and thrive in the new world of @ ORGANIZATION1. Saeng promises to himself that when the plant grows in the spring, she will do so by taking her driving test again. This symbol of the future is extremely important to the live story and that is why Ming fon Ho, the author of Winter Hibiscus, chose to end with this vital symbol.           

<START>

 

The author of " Winter Hibiscus " concludes the story with the paragraph " When they return saeng silently swore to themselves, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, so I will take this test again. The author most likely chose this last paragraph to help the reader understand the message. The message of this story is that no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. The author makes this the last paragraph to get the reader to think and think about what it means.          

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with this paragraph for a reason. This reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought him home. For example, she said " I failed " when talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she lived. For example, she said "it's not like home". This is why the author concludes this paragraph.         

<START>

 

“When they come back,” Saeng vowed, “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again.” @ CAPS1 of this whole statement with the story because she loves being in the garden and you are not out loud in the garden when it snows. Secondly, she likes plants and things similar to plants etc. That is why the author concluded the story paragraph due to the fact that when spring comes, Saeng will buy plants and flowers. Finally, Saeng sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flower shop to see if it can be purchased, and Saeng is very upset when something is wrong with them.   

<START>

 

In the text, when the mother said “It's the flowers aren't so pretty, but it's strong enough to get through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.” This sentence shows that Saeng is like the flowers. They are strong to live the winter, it shows that they are very pretty and strong in the spring. It emphasizes that Saeng will be strong and more confident in the spring. That is why the author the put at the end. This is also reflected on the flower, how pretty and strong they are in the spring

In Minfong Ho's short story "Winter Hibiscus", the author includes a paragraph at the end indicating that the main character, Saeng, will be retaking his driving test. Ho, include this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States, she and her mother had moved here from Vietnam. Throughout history, she remembers her family life in Vietnam. About her grandmother and the flowers there. " Where was I ... hibiscus hedge ?" . His sweet grandmother ? " In the flower shop, Saeng is a hibiscus flower as they had in Vietnam. She sees how he has adapted to survive the winter here. As she plants the flower in her garden, she promises herself to get her driver's license next spring. She, too, wants to adapt to @ LOCATION3 and be able to live here without missing out on too much at home. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show Saeng too, that she wants to adapt to her environment and pass the driver's license,                

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the true meaning of hibiscus. The hibiscus is symbolic for Saeng in many ways, but most importantly, it represents change, growth, and the ability to overcome obstacles. Seeing him, she is overwhelmed by childhood memories and sentimentality. However, she has to adjust to her new home if she is to grow as a person. It will survive here, just as the hibiscus will survive the winter. Also, Saeng swears that "in the spring" when "this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again." She is determined to succeed, and the hibiscus itself represents triumph over obstacles. It represents survival and endurance through life's disappointments and challenges, from failing a driving test to starting a new life in a foreign and foreign land. The author's choice to end the story with this paragraph shows Saeng's ultimate understanding of his strength through the hibiscus symbol.         

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the paragraph like this because he / she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message the author was trying to get across was that even though she had failed the test, she was going to give it a try next year. An example of this is an exact quote "in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I will retest". That's why I think the author concludes the story like this.   

<START>

 

The author includes the story with this paragraph because, since Saeng failed his driving test for the first time, when the hibiscus begins to bud, it will represent a change in his life. In addition, Saeng used to have hibiscus flowers in her old home in Vietnam, so when the flower buds could show that she has a new home. 

<START>

 

The author ended the story with, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take that test again." The reason for the conclusion is that it is important that Saeng feels at home. When the hibiscus blossoms, it will remind her of home and comfort her, when she feels at peace and at home, she will pass the test better.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is not abandoning her new home or forgetting her old one. She shows that she doesn't give up when she brings home the flower to plant. It also shows that she won't forget her old home. Also when she said, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, then I will take the test again." It shows that she is giving her new home another chance and that she is not giving up. Another example is when he says, "Almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of things she once considered strange before had become, thanks to the silent season-to-season repetition, almost familiar now." Here she accepts the changes and gives her new home another chance. She does not give it up.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph. She's doing it because she's ready to do the same next year. She loves spending time with her mom, she loves plants, she loves having fun with her mom. These are a few reasons why she concludes with this paragraph.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings comfort. @ CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @ LOCATION1, she was frustrated and missed her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded him of his grandmother. She writes "she closed her eyes and inhaled deeply as the scent filled her lungs" after Saeng smelled the flower, it reminded her "to comb her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed", that comforted her in a time of disappointment. @ CAPS2 she didn't have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed, the hibiscus was " exquisite " and as she said the word @ CAPS1 " dokor malik " which means hibiscus, she " savored the feel of the word on her tongue ". @ CAPS2 joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will retest in the spring when "the snow melts and the hibiscus buds, thus bringing joy, love and solace to the reader as she goes. 'he feels what Saeng feels.            

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph because it relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and his situation in a new country. This shows that Saeng is using hibiscus and its adaptability for inspiration. Throughout the story, Saeng describes how she had always seen the hibiscus at home in her former country. Her mother explains to her that the hibiscus she bought is a little different from the one at home. But she says it's because it's strong and has been able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the United States. This is what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She may have failed her license test, but she used the Hibiscus Stocks to set a goal. The plant will go through a cold and snowy winter, but it will grow and flower in the spring. Saeng would use this time to study and prepare, and she will be confident for the test. The paragraph in which the author ends shows the link that Saeng established with his situation and that of the factory.         

<START>

 

“ If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. " This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also be applied to Saeng's situation in the short story " Winter Hibiscus ." Saeng fails her driving test and, on her way home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower that reminds her of her homeland. Sadness surrounds her and she buys the plant to soothe her grief. She brings it home and is reprimanded by her mother first, then thanked for the purchase. As Saeng plants the hibiscus, she hears the familiar horn of the Canada geese. The text reads: "Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things she had previously considered strange had become familiar to her, thanks to the silent repetition from season to season." This quote shows the adaptation she had to face when coming to @ LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, it will adapt to the terrain and to the labors of @ LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspired her to go ahead and try to license again as the plant moved forward through the winter.              

<START>

 

The author ends the story this way because Saeng feels a sense of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower reminds him of his homeland with his grandmother. According to the story, "the familiar frogrence filled his lungs, and Saeng could almost smell the light strands of his grandmother's long gray hair." you can also tell that she misses her homeland, but always keeps it close to her heart wherever she goes. The text says that "it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and delicate flowers with purplish petals and white centers." She seems to be very close to nature and all of her desirable traits. When she failed the test, she bought her flower “@ CAPS1 Malik”, as a measure of comfort. They both decided to plant it in their garden, and in doing so, Saeng received a huge boost in confidence to take the test again.        

<START>

 

She compares the paragraph to the story to compare it to school. The test is all about making new friends and doing well on the test and classes. In the paragraph it was written, " Then I will take this test again." " That's why it compares this paragraph to school.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's determination to overcome the obstacles of his past experience. For example, the story begins with a "test" of Saeng, as she relived her memories in the greenhouse, she began to crack. "A wave of loss so deep and a story that it stung Saeng's eyes has now swept over her." She then buys the plant and brings it back to her mother, telling her that she "failed". The mother then becomes understanding and helps Saeng take back the vow The “ test ”, the narrator emphasizes Saeng's determination to overcome the troubles of his past and move forward into the future.      

<START>

 

Because her schoolwork was the only reason she studied flowers in a leafy garden. And it is obvious that she failed the test, so when the spring starts showing, she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom and she can do more studies to pass the test and not have to take it again. I feel like she is also looking forward to the return of spring now a day so that she can enjoy the flowers and gifts of growth and study.  

<START>

 

I think the author concluded the story with this particular paragraph because she wanted us to see Saeng not giving up Saeng was originally from Vietnam but moved to the United States. He missed being home so much because nothing was the same. “It's not a real one,” Saeng muttered. 'I mean, not like the kind we had to-to. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. “But once Saeng finally realized that she was starting to adjust to life in America, she decided she was going to take the driving test one more time. "When they come back in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again."      

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she seems to be comfortable heading when she sees the geese and plants the hibiscus in the winter and keeps it from dying. In the story, it says "... their shallow banks are clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now". I think that explains how she feels after seeing the geese fly overhead because she used to see it in Vietnam. Also, "when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding", she gains more confidence as she leads as if she were back in Vietnam. In short, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.   

<START>

 

I think the reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imagine what will happen next when spring comes for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their image to connect with the story. Another reason the author chose to end the story like this with this paragraph was to give the reader hope that she might pass the test next time. It was also a way to end the story on a high note.   

<START>

 

The author ended the story with this exact paragraph because, like the geese, she will be back to try again. Just in case she couldn't JUST finish everything she wanted to do and the author wanted the reader to know the character's determination and ambition in the story. Also to show readers that the characteristics of the characters couldn't be beaten by a winter and that she will continue until she does what she has to do.  

<START>

 

The author of the story "Winter Hibiscus" most likely concludes it with Saeng's paragraph promising to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations, a person can never give up and sink into the sky. despair and that there is always something to be comforted about. someone. In the story, glimpses of @ CAPS1's home are given in his recollections and from them the reader can understand how Saeng is having a difficult day. The author describes these warm and heartwarming memories to help cope with the girl's cold and bitter day. “She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. The familiar scent filled her lungs. Here, saeng remembers a memory of his grandmother and it saddens him at the thought of his home and its loss. The author accumulates Saeng's desperation and anger for the last paragraph. The author has this as the last paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, " Then I'll take this test again." You can feel his hope. Also, the author wants to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world, and you can turn to the simple things. Saeng says “ the geese are coming back and this hibiscus is budding, ” and it shows how reliable there are things that can give you security when you think you don't have one. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of hopelessness in the story, to emphasize the need for hope, and to show that there are always things that can give you hope and security.              

<START>

 

The author concludes the story from the paragraph because, the author would like to end the last sentence of the story. Also at the end of the paragraph is when she visualizes and puts her effort on the hibiscus. Therefore, his thoughts are valued for the plant. The author wanted more proof of the story. For example, when they say, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese are streaming and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again. It includes winter time for the plant. In addition, on @ DATE2 and spring the plant returns, that the saeng character will pick it up and visit it.

<START>

 

The author includes it at the end to show how much she cares about the plant and brought it back to her childhood. An example of her love for the plant is this rich scent "(Paragraph Minfong Ho), examples @ CAPS1" It was sweet and fresh "(paragraph Minfong Ho) An example of the childhood plan is that she had not even realized that she had known but had forgotten. she came back we could reed (paragraphs Minfong Ho) For these ways of thinking that's why the author adds this at the end. 

<START>

 

I think the author left this as the last thing the reader would read, so it will be a post. In the story, this girl has now moved to this whole new environment and culture. The only thing she knew was a flower that grew wild where she lived. This little wish to herself was a message not to give up. Keep going and if you open your mind to new things, who knows what you can experience and learn. So this girl didn't give up. His plant was like the representation of a new beginning. When his plant starts again, so do I. It can also be a representation of his life itself. I say a new begging because in the text it says,        

<START>

 

I think the author wrote this because maybe as she feels in winter she could really show people who she is, but when spring comes out she loves a flower that is dead all winter 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the previous paragraph spoke of " winter hibiscus " and geese. So the author simply writes another concluding paragraph that simply concludes the story, and the reader leaves with a sense of well-being.

In Minfong Ho's Winter Hibiscus story, she explains the obstacles Saeng faced in coming to another country. In this story, Saeng had just failed her driver's license as she remembered her home through tropical flowers. Moreover the author writes at the end of the story referring to the geese "when they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, it is spring, when the snow will melt and the geese will return and the hibiscus will bud, then I will take the test again. ” This part of the story is very important as it examines its growth and hope for change, just us the geese will return and the hibiscus will turn into a beautiful blooming flower. In addition, he explains to everyone that she will not give up and that she will change the environment just like the life of the plants did and the geese are returning to the changed environment. This part of the story is very important to the reader, @ CAPS1 it concludes Saeng's thoughts and hopes for the future by adjusting to his new surroundings.         

<START>

 

The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reasons. I think the author wanted to give an interesting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example, the author explains how hibiscus grows and the elements necessary for its growth, such as sunlight, soil water and garbage collection. Perhaps the author thinks that by explaining that when it snows the process begins again, the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reasons. I think the author wanted to give an interesting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example, the author explains how hibiscus grows and the elements necessary for its growth, such as sunlight, soil water and water collection.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng said she failed the test, and when spring returns, she will retake the test. The last paragraph says, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take the test again." She doesn't really tell us what test she's supposed to take.  

<START>

 

The reason she said she would wait until spring to retake the test is to see if she's still like bitter melon on the Big-mac.

<START>

 

The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph because this saying has to redo the test. What she means by that is that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to adapt to life like the hibiscus did. She also says do your best because everything in the world is about living life to the fullest for you. So this is a good conclusion for Story.    

<START>

 

I think the reason the author concludes the story like this is because it has an ending. also so you know the story is they could do more. 

<START>

 

What the author concludes that in the spring when the snow melts and the flower returns, it puts spring at risk for the house. Which makes her relax. Spring is also a prettier time as all the flowers have come out and the flower that reminds her of blessings at home.  

<START>

 

Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take this test again. Saeng will be waiting to take the test when she finds out that she will pass the test so that she can get her license. Saeng wants her to have a license so that she can drive wherever she wants. Thus, she does not need to ask her mother to take her wherever she wants to go, she can take herself wherever she wants. But she must wait for the snow to melt before taking her exam again.    

<START>

 

The paragraph shows that Saeng has a lot of feelings for his plants. She loves plants and she loves taking the time to spend with plants. She wants to say in this last paragraph that she can not wait for the winter to go so that her plants bud and she can enjoy her plants.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it ties everything together. I think the author is using. it is also to say that in the spring it will pass the test. I really like the passage where she says "... in the spring, when the snow melts ...". I like it because it explains what she wants and how she thinks about it.    

<START>

 

The author is most likely using this paragraph to show that she is setting a goal to get the cycle started all over again. She uses the geese as a symbol of spring, when she begins to prepare for this "test" again. The hibiscus that buds in this paragraph is a bearer of hope, because it is once again a beginning of the cycle and an object of reminiscence in history. In conclusion, this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and devices to convey hope, good memories and a new beginning.   

<START>

 

She would grow flowers and water the geese that returned to her pond.

THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THIS PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE REASON THAT THE AUTHOR REALLY WANTED TO SHOW THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER. ANOTHER REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME. FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE END OF THIS PARAGRAPH IT IS STATED "THEN I WILL TAKE THIS TEST.", IT LINKING THIS SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER. THAT THEN LINKS IT TO THE THEME OF ADJUSTMENT AND KEEP TRYING UNTIL YOU ADJUST. THIS LAST PARAGRAPH WAS ESSENTIAL FOR THE THEME AND THE SENSE OF HISTORY.

I believe the author concludes the story "Winter Hibiscus", written by Minfong Ho, with "When they return Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, so I will take this test again, "as she tries to show how past memories can be turned into hope and determination. After failing his driving test, Saeng finds the Hibiscus, the memories of his homeland and her grandmother consumes it. She buys the plant and puts it in the kitchen garden. Once the planting is complete, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese flying above her head. Using her memory of her old home and her family, applied to his new surroundings, Saeng swears to take the test again, to try again The author ends the story "Winter Hibiscus" with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up.

The author concludes with this story to show how Saeng is ready to accept his new life. Once the geese and the hibiscus are back, she feels right at home. It is when she feels more comfortable that she will be ready to take the test again. The text says “run and the geese come back” this hibiscus is budding, so I'll take this test again. ”Clearly the geese and hibiscus remind her of home. Once she feels at home, she will feel right at home. at ease, which is why the author concludes with this passage.

The author concluded with this paragraph because it showed a rephrasing of the main idea of the story and the readers understood what the story was about. That is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.

The author explains that she failed the test. While it is still winter and the hibiscus is still trying to grow, its beautiful hawks are returning. As she tells her mother "that she will not take the test again, until the hibiscus begins to bud and spring is back.  

<START>

 

Yes, I think that concludes the story because after all of this in the story and all this learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother said about the hibiscus and its auction. And what she means by that end sentence is that when spring comes, she will take this test again. the test will determine whether or not she has learned enough about gardening from her mother in the past.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because I'm assuming his grandmother died while the geese were flying. Or that's when the flowers start to bloom.

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" included the last paragraph to let readers know that she will move on, but always remember her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly regretted his old country. “It's not a real one,” Saeng muttered. "I mean not like the kind we had to-at," she found she was still too shaky to say the words at home, the last time she burst into tears again. “ He missed his home in the other country and found it difficult to walk through it. The author could not yet accept his new country as a home. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of his old country, which made it even harder to move on. One of the flowers had fallen and Saeng picked it up carefully and smelled it. Saeng could almost smell the light strands of his grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as he she was combing them with the fine-toothed buffalo horn comb. could hold. "Gently, she closed her palm around him and held him tight. That, at least, she could hang on to. “ The author now had a solid thing to remind him of his home. It was the first step to finally move on. Now Saeng needed some time to get used to his new country.” Almost reluctantly, she said. realized that many of the things she had thought so strange before had become almost familiar to her now. Saeng needed a little more time, almost like hibernation. She decided that once the hibiscus was out of hibernation and ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng would decide the time between failure and spring would be long enough to adjust to his new life. By passing the test, Saeng will move on. The author has included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the final steps towards accepting her new country and moving on to pass the test of it, although she remembers her old country at through the winter hibiscus.

The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginning of the story the girl failed the test. And so, when she told her mother that, she saw that she was mad at it. So after planting the plant, she decided to take the test knowing her mother would think the best. It's also in there because the story began when she told her mother that she had failed the test. And if you kept it away, people reading it would be like, okay, so her mom just let her fail the test and didn't do anything about it. Also, when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they will want to know if she took it back and why she took it back if she did.      

<START>

 

The author ended the story with an inconclusive ending. What I mean is that the author wrote to keep the readers interested so that they would want to read his other books. Plus, with an ending like this, it kind of leaves room for improvement and more.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up until she succeeds in the task given to her by her mother. Saeng fails the test because, although she buys a beautiful plant, it is way overpriced. “But how could you? All the seeds in this vegetable garden have not been so expensive! Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has let her mother down. Saeng always plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. “Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug a hole and carefully lowered the“ winter hibiscus. ” This shows that even if she had failed, she was not going to give up the hibiscus because it represented her home. It was very special for her.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the paragraph because she is used to doing so.

<START>

 

I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adjust to their new country. At the beginning of the story, the character " Saeng " is homesick and has not adapted to his new country. She returns home after her failed driving test, and on the way she flaunts a hibiscus in a florist. Hishiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam. For Saeng, hibiscus represents comfort in case of disappointment, the connection with his past experiences and his ability to overcome obstacles. Saeng did not adjust to this change in her life and it affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obstacles in your life but that there will always be something or someone who will help you to overcome it. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and showing the reader that saeng was hibiscus as a way to overcome and when she is ready and adjusted, she will retake her driving test.         

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he says that after winter and spring are over and the hibiscus is budding, I will start over and try again. The author says that saeng cannot wait until spring to be able to plant his own small garden. That's why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.  

<START>

 

This paragraph represents an action that Saeng will take over a period of one year. It will build and change in time to retake the test, it's like a rebirth in a way. The girl wants to be a whole new person when the test returns. Her mother seems to be disturbed by every action or choice of her daughters. The girl suddenly relishes the action for the hibiscus and why it dies. "... thought the quiet rehearsal from season to season." She tells herself about the flower and the geese. During the year the flower goes through phases of death and then rebirth. Saeng wants to be better after she goes through a phase like the flower. It opens to become beautiful again.          

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because when she returned from her driving test on the way home, she saw some winter hibiscus which was so beautiful. Then she went to the store and bought these flowers and it cost a lot of money when she got home and her mother planted some vegetables and her mother asked her what it is for her to say the truth and let her know that the flower costs a lot of money she gets mad at it, how can she do that - Saeng made the big decision to go, even though her mother is angry, she loves these flowers, I guess because they stayed in Vietnam. The author put this paragraph, I think because the geese are coming back and the flowers are growing, she will do the test again because when she buys, no flower has come out yet, so when she came out, she will be there will return just to let him know you are seeing the first time and wait until he grows up that you can take the test again. In my onpion, that's a good ending and it's also a good question too.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with "when they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself ...", because that offers the reader a conclusion. This passage means that Saeng will try to repeat her driving test once she adjusts to her new life in a new country. Once she can familiarize herself with her surroundings, she will feel more comfortable. Throughout history, her detachment from Vietnam makes her feel lonely. The hibiscus plant is what first gives her a feeling of comfort, "It was soft and cool ... as she had imagined." The end paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @ LOCATION2 than a simple plant and a few geese.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the "snow melts and the geese come back" it will be time to plant and work some more in the garden, because with snow on the ground you cannot plant. but the geese come back if the time of year to plant the seed and have a bad flock / tether bigger. The test is whether it can have a better grade than in previous years, and the previous year.

The author concludes the story with "In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again." She does this to show that now Saeng is adjusting and making decisions in her new country, just like she did in her native country. In Vietnam, Saeng used to brush his grandmother's hair and help her put it in a bun and put a hibiscus in it. It was one of his traditions with that. In addition, when she drew water from the well, a hibiscus sometimes rose with the bucket. These two thus the hibiscus was seen as an object of comfort, now that she is in the states, she tries to make good use of it, while taking into account what is repeated in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and the plants start to grow in the spring. Resuming the test in the spring symbolizes that she is ready to start the test, just like the hibiscus that will bloom. The potted plant in his garden and Saeng moving it both mean a change, but a memory of old traditions and a space for new ones.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the final determination and strength that was given to Saeng. It's almost as if it took this plant to show him to get up and pass the test. The plant becomes an element of behavior that reminds him of his homeland. She came back with the plant to show her mother but found herself too shaking to even say the words "home". It shows how much he misses the house. But she is able to realize that this is her new home and that everything is becoming more familiar. To her.   

<START>

 

She ends it with this sentence because it is the sign of a new life. Just like the winter that killed the plants ending their life, spring will come and start again. This is how Saeng feels because she left her country and all the memories left behind will feel out of place like winter hibiscus, but when spring comes, she will feel like a new person ready and able to take on challenges as she put it here "through the quiet repetition from season to season, almost familiar to her now", she describes that with a new season new changes come with it and that after these changes, she will pass the driving test again.  

<START>

 

The author ends with this paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she failed this time, other opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times are happening to her now, good times are yet to come. For several reasons, this was a very effective way to end the story.   

<START>

 

The author uses symbolism to convey a different message. Saeng said in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.

In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. She gives examples from history that might help find these reasons. One of the reasons is that we know she won't give up. In the story, she says "Then I'll take the test again." This tells us that she will continue to try and that she is determined to do so. Another reason is that she is trying to tell us that there is a future for hibiscus. How is it, when she says " ... and this hibiscus is budding ", that the hibiscus has a chance to change and get used to its surroundings, just like the girl in the story will. The last reason is that it tells us that she is doing and will do her best. When she says “she realized that a lot of things that she thought were strange…, almost familiar to her now,” @ CAPS1 tries to get used to her surroundings and now realizes that she can.

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" concludes the story, determined to pass the test once the winter is over and the flower is budding. It shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the trials of each. Winter is an obstacle for the flower, but it will live to flourish in the spring. This gives the author the assurance that she too can overcome her difficulties in order to prosper. Another difficulty that she and the hibiscus at the same time @ CAPS1 is " related to the root ".

Author Minfong Ho concluded the story "Winter Hibiscus", with this certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to take the driving test and also in a way to getting used to his new home. It's kind of like a motivation, "when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that test again." Motivation is the flower, bringing back fond memories to the people who made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story as he said, next year Saeng will start over. To be happy with your new life and not dwell on your past. Saeng said, ".. in the spring ..." is the start of a new year to start over and rejoice. It was a really good way to end the story, because it creates a positive vibe. It lets readers know that Saeng is a strong person who can remember the past but move on to a new day and a new life. And I think the author tries to stress that everyone should have the strength to do the same.

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it seems hopeful. She was not adjusting very well to her new home and that made her desperate. Saeng failed her driving test, which only made matters worse for her. To make matters better, she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home. She found the plant very comforting and it helped her through difficult times. In the last paragraph, Saeng looks forward to spring so he can take the test again and hopefully pass it this time around. I think the paragraph gives a sense of hope, which is how the author concluded the story as he did.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and that there is still hope. It is also teaching the reader to have hope and patience and to know that things take time. Saeng failed the test of not giving in to his sorrows and misery of missing his country. She said, "Almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of things that she once considered strange had become, through the silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar to her now." It shows that she is adapting. So, ending with that and comparing to geese, it shows that she is getting stronger and stronger. She will retake the test because she will not give up.

Clearly Tearing up the story Winter @ CAPS1, author @ CAPS2 this phrase "when they come back Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take that test Again ”in the story because the passage relates to the story title Winter @ CAPS1.

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that even though Saeng did not pass her last test well, Saeng will go back and take it again so that she can pass it. The author shows Saeng's determination to pass the test and do better next time. 

<START>

 

I think the author ends the story with this paragraph because he stuffed the plant which represents a lot of positive things for the character who failed the test he really wanted to pass. Both the character and the plant show persistence and I think the author tries to send a message to the reader that they never give up on something you want to accomplish. The plant gives an emblem of perseverance as it survives the harsh winter. The main character does not give up on the test she wants to take. The author gives a message not to give up.

At the end of the story the author says "when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again".

@ ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl named Saeng. She's a teenage girl. His family has just moved from Vietnam to the United States. Saeng failed her driving test and on the way home she discovers this beautiful plant named Hibiscus which she falls in love with Hibiscus. Saeng's mother has a garden, she always plants things using plants and vegetables from her garden for dinner. The author concludes a paragraph that says where Hibiscus plants bud in spring Saeng with redoing the test. I think Saeng says this because she wants to see the beautiful plants when she passes the test and she thinks seeing Hibiscus will help her pass the driver's license.   

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is hoping to pass her test. The hibiscus will have started to sprout and give it the strength to retake the test and hopefully pass everything because of the winter hibiscus that reminded him of home. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph of "When they come back Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will do this test again" because this paragraph can show that the hibiscus is the reason why Saeng wants to retry the test. If the hibiscus is budding after the snow has melted and the geese return, then it can because the hibiscus is strong and will not give up its test. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this to show that saeng will not give up. It is possible to adapt and try to love what is around you. Saeng struggled to come out "I failed the test" and couldn't say "at home", it shows her insecurity and loneliness for the new world around her and saying that she will try again in the spring , the reader hopes that she will adapt and enjoys her surroundings. She is now going through an expiration of this old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now there are similarities and because she will try again in the spring it means that she has decided to go give it a chance to a new location.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she says "Then I will take this test again", she believes in Flowers. she and the Flowers both adapt to circumstances. They are both determined at @ CAPS1 in places @ CAPS2. They both overcome obstacles. Maybe she wants to see what awaits her. she hopes she's right about the Flowers maybe, she loves spring.     

<START>

 

I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It basically sums up the story and sums it up in a few words that would have you wondering what happened next and if there is a sequel. It's a really good story that I can personally relate to in so many ways.  

<START>

 

The reason why the author concludes this type of senerario is simply because the author is having a hard time going through and / or a situation in this particular author that you know my son, but if you understand correctly you will open your eyes and see it's time to shine, you might as well grab it before you lose your chance, you only have one day to prove you're worthy of people.

<START>

 

The author concludes with this sentence because it shows girls self-confidence. It also gives him plenty of time to prepare for the next test. She also knows she will be ready when her flower begins to bud.  

<START>

 

Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Can he rectify another budding vow story silently and he will rectify it. Story in the spring when they return  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she said that if it is possible for these things to happen, then she should be able to take the test and pass it. She was comparing things that she knew didn't go together. For example, she said that in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, she will take the test again. She meant that if the thing she loves the most overcame her obstacle, then she would do what hurt her the most again. She is not sure if she retakes the test, she will try again and again until she passes it. In the story, she does not know how to integrate. All she knows is what she learned in her country. All she has to do is try harder and she might be able to pass her test.      

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paraghragh because when she told her mother that she had failed her test she was crying, but I think it was deeper than that. I think she missed the house so much that she couldn't concentrate. She must have been crying because of something because she didn't want her mother to know that she misses home.  

<START>

 

When they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again. The author concludes the story because, as if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. 

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that the hibiscus inspires him and gives him comfort that no one could try to do. For example, after Saeng failed her driving test, she was disappointed. On her way home, she saw a hibiscus and went to a florist to try and buy it. Saeng took a peddler from the plant and held it tight as she closed her eyes. The plant reminded her of her true home in Vietnam that she loved. The hibuscus became a form of solace for Saeng since she had just failed her driving test, even though the plant was not the same as the house. By the author who ends the story with Saeng by saying that she will wait for the hibiscus to start budding to take the test again, it shows that the hibiscus helps her overcome life's obstacles and overcome difficulties that she is facing.      

<START>

 

What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that where it is a season for these plants, she will retest. The test to start loving the plot. Love the features and the characters. Also the history of these plants.

She is like geese as they overcome and embrace the harsh cold by flying away elsewhere and returning when it is hot, as she has to wait until she is more ready and confident to take the test the second time around.

This story of believing in yourself and never giving up was a story of perseverance. Saeng truly believed that she could pass her driving test, and although she was disappointed with the result, she found a way to deal with her loss. The blooming hibiscus means a lot to her because she can connect him to her homeland and, and that's a thing of beauty. something she needed at such an ugly time for her. It is always difficult to adapt to a new country in a short time. I know what it is when a little thing goes wrong. You can break and you will feel a lot worse than you actually do. You feel helpless and lonely just like the hibiscus growing next to the highway in the photo. Saeng has vowed to retake his driving test when his hibiscus blooms in the spring.

In the story “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows his determination. Saeng has problems both adjusting and adjusting to the changes in his new life. we see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, "she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again." we see that Saeng bought the flower because she felt safe. It was something about her that seemed familiar to her and I think that's why she included the story in this paragraph because next year she will have a sense of security and familiarity in the test as the experience she lived will be again.

" I think this line was added in order to create a sense of hope for the future, which contrasts so much with the depressing nature of the story, creating a happy ending. Throughout the trial, Saeng is depressed, she had to leave her homeland so hastily losing her childhood and her beloved grandmother, "A wink, a modified switch, a boat ride in at night, and it was all gone. " as Saeng tells in more detail. The number of saeng cries when remembering his tragic past also contributes to the feelings of sadness in the story. I am both the greenhouse, remembering the events of her grandmother, like when she said, "Saeng could almost smell the light strands of her grandmother's gray hair. Saeng would help tie the hair into a bun. , then slip a dok Malik bud into it. " and in the garden, when she talks to her mother and plants the flower. After all this grief, putting a hopeful ending, the writer managed to give hope for the future.

She says while cloning spring I will take the test again because she knows if she fails again her mom will be disappointed with her because she doesn't try enough or maybe they too won't be anymore. never closer. The mother thinks simply because she continues to fail the test because of its connection to her past experiences or being posted to her new country. and her ability to overcome obstacles is ultimately I think she is comforted by the memories or her country of origin.

The author concludes the story with this quote for one main reason. This reason is that it shows that the girl has hope. In a story, one of the best qualities that a character can have is hope, as this interests the reader and helps to elevate the morale of the story. This is why the author concludes the story with this quote.   

<START>

 

The author of this story story created the last paragraph so that it ends the story with a nice ending. The fact of never giving up and trying over and over again. The author said, "I will take the test again." In the story, Saeng said, " I failed the test, " but now she's not giving up. This last paragraph makes a lot of sense and is necessary for this story to be complete. So just like the others don't give up at @ LOCATION1, Saeng does the same and takes the test again.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with "when they come back Saeng silently marvels, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again", because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined what she must do to accomplish what she failed. Since she failed the test the first time around, she wants to overcome her failure and pass it, so the author wants her to look determined in the end. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph as it lengthens the story and gives it a good ending but I have no idea what that means so the author should explain what it means not me.

<START>

 

The plant was important to Saeng because it came from his native land. Saeng said she would retake her driving test when her plant blooms. The plant was a reamder of her home and what she came from. The plant in Saeng was a form of trust. Saeng went through difficult times and the plant was close to her because she came from her native land.    

<START>

 

I believe the author ended the story with this paragraph to create a sense of wonder. I think this is because if you put the word " test " in context it could mean a lot of things. For example, it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of his situation. It could also mean testing to adjust to her new home when spring arrives. That's why I think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the last paragraph.

Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus” story is about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing, "When they come back [the geese] then I will take this test @ NUM1). The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on the way home he had seen an assortment flowers native to her native country. ”Saeng felt such a shock of recognition so intense that he was almost @ NUM2) The sight of these flowers, namely the hibiscus, reminded her of what she had lost and brought her back to life. offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even if it was not in the land it belonged to. Her mother says, “Her flowers are not so pretty, but they are quite strong. This is what @ NUM3). Saeng, after hearing this, decides that she could also be strong and try to do her best in school. It would fit just like the winter hibiscus.        

<START>

 

She said this because she was more interested in the flowers than in a test.

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows the end of one thing and the beginning of another. After she is upset and thinks about home, she realizes that something new is happening and she has to come to terms with it. So in the spring it will start again as the flower blooms.  

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants to make it clear that the character doesn't want to rush into the things he wants to do well and not take the fast lane.    

<START>

 

This shows the importance of the hibiscus to Saeng and his dedication to the flower. He also indicates that she will wait until next spring to admire the flower again.   

<START>

 

The author ends this story with this paragraph because it explains her thoughts and why she passes this test. She explains that next year, she will find out if she feels at home. 

<START>

 

When the author concluded the tale with when they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again to demonstrate the ability to overcome the obstacles, to find comfort in a time of disappointment and its connection to past experiences. Firstly, it demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles as they are obstacles in everyone's life, and you don't have a choice to overcome them because they are limitless. So, the hibiscus flower represents obstacles and time represents time because time prevents the flower from blooming and flourishing. Second, it also represents finding comfort in a time of disappointment, because when you cross an obstacle you will find lingering disappointment there. However, she knows that the hibiscus will return and she is aware of the obstacles that return. Finally, he asserts her link with her past experience because she is trapped in a world she does not know, which would make her an alien. She captures the feeling of not being in her place because you can understand that the flower of hiatcus would be her because she is eccentric and different from the rest of the people in her environment, she tries to adapt her lifestyle and tries to survive in the world, like when she was in her own country.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph because this paragraph represents saeng's determination and the situation she has now. She has just arrived in the new country and she has not adjusted to this new country yet. She was deceived as "the starlight of the afternoon of the war". " War " showed that saeng was very upset. After meeting the flower, she thought about her old country, her missing homeland. She felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she would have to adjust to the new situation, she was still too shaky to say the words at home. Finally, she burst into tears again. She missed her housewife a lot " snows " symbolized the predicament she had now. But she believed that she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. " Spring " symbolized the hope of a new life saeng believed that things would improve in the spring. She would be successful in the spring. She had the determination to succeed, which is why the author uses this paragraph as a conclusion. It symbolizes hope.              

<START>

 

The author included this because she felt that since Saeng failed the test maybe she should get a second chance because she tried so hard before. When Saeng says “Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it. This upset her mother because she used a lot of money for a plant just so she could feel at home again since she had one when she was in her old home. Finally, her mother said, "It's a beautiful plant" to make her feel better because she feels bad for the way she acted towards her daughter. After everything Saeng had to go through, this is the reason why the author added the last passage in the story.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph, the author says that Saeng will not stop until she passes the test she will try and will try until her death. The author again refers to the story. 

<START>

 

The purpose of this author's conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return, she will have to take care of the plant again. Clearly, because doing a test is a big responsibility, so taking care of this plant is also a huge task when it comes to retaking the test. that is what the purpose of the last sentence meant.    

<START>

 

Because planting flowers and wasting it in the garden is @ CAPS1's hobby. And without it, she cannot think clearly or create. Therefore, waiting for them to return will make her happier and able to do her job.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she says when everything gets back to normal, that's when she'll retake the test. Second, because there wouldn't be anything more to say if it hadn't been like she wanted it to be again. For example, if you were building a house and a blizzard hit you would stop, say you wouldn't continue until the weather was fine. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.

Winter Hibiscus author Minfong Ho ended the story in this way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying. “Her flowers aren't quite as pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the winter. That is what matters. “Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their life over at @ LOCATION1, that @ LOCATION1 @ MONTH1 won't be so pretty, but they will survive, that's what matters. Her words allay her daughters' concerns about the ore starting. Additionally, the budding hibiscus could be considered a symbol of rebirth, as it dies and grows with the seasons. The family is dying in an @ CAPS1 family and being @ CAPS2 was an @ CAPS3 family. However, even though they are "dead" as a @ CAPS1 family, that does not mean that they have lost their inheritance, which is why the author ends up talking about a flower that is both @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS3 just like Saeng.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will persevere through the winter and try to adjust to his new lifestyle. Moving to a new country / culture is extremely difficult, and Saeng is bad, but she doesn't give up to create a new life at @ LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, "In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, then I will pass this test," is a sentence of determination and hope. Saeng's whole story struggled to adjust to his no and the memory of his homeland gave him a sense of security. The sentence ends her emotion and shows how strong she is. @ CAPS1 could easily give up her driving test, but she won't. It's a happy ending for a somewhat sad story. The continuation of the sentence shows Saeng's dwoton his plant. This hibiscus will survive, just like Saeng when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, just like Saeng. She will do everything possible to fit in and enjoy her new life. This plant will help him get through that by reminding him of Vietnam and giving him a companion throughout the winter. The author would not have chosen a better conclusion for this story. The orggos conclusion is a new hope for perseverance and success. As a result, the reader is tested with a sense of pleasure and a good feeling towards the story. This conclusion shows how Saeng adapts to changes in information and hopes to enjoy his new life at @ LOCATION1.

The story was about a girl who returned home after failing her driving test and collapsing over her " house " where she no longer lived. After she broke down, bought the factory, and learned to come to terms with the fact that she no longer lived in Vietnam and had failed her driving test, she realized that she just had to learn to love it. . She also learned that her time would come and that she would drive someday. The reason the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because it is the conclusion of the story. this is where the important things are done.      

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a statement that Saeng silently swore to himself. Saeng says she will take the test again, referring to the driving test. Seeing geese flying in a "V" and seeing the hibiscus gave Saeng a memory of his homeland. Saeng misses his homeland. The author wanted the @ CAPS1 to look like Saeng is starting to feel at home again. The hibiscus is just a symbol for Saeng telling her that it will be @ CAPS2.K, and that it's good for her to miss Vietnam but also that it's good to have a new life, so Saeng , in the spring, will take him drivers test again with a new attitude and will take the test.

The author concludes the story with the paragraph to tell you when Saeng was going to take the test again, to find the plant. This is a concluding paragraph that gives an overview of what will happen in the future, which is also why the author added this paragraph. 

<START>

 

The author ends the story with "When they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again" to show a comparison. Since the plant reminds her of home, when she buds she will be more confident to take the test. When she looked at the petals of the flower, she said, “She gently closed her palm around her and held it tight. At least that she could hang on to. It shows that she really missed her house and had nothing to give him confidence. The flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her driving test. Saeng felt out of place in his new surroundings. The hibiscus flower gave him motivation. It gave her a chance to connect with a part of her old home, in her new home. Saeng thinks, "And that rich, sweet scent, which was also familiar." This shows that this flower had sentimental importance, she needed it. Therefore, the author ended with this paragraph to show a comparison and the importance of the flower for its adaptation.

In "Winter Hibiscus", Minfong Ho ends the story as she does to show a sign of hope. Saeng will start again when the world starts again. Spring is the time when animals come out of their winter burrows, the trees bloom and the snow melts. It is a time of renewal. Saeng “Silently vowed to try again in the spring. The hibiscus does these actions by emerging from its buds and flowering. Ho ends his story in the hope of a new beginning. Saeng swears, "Then I'll take this test again." In the choice of the word "This test again" portrays his new attitude. She wants to try again, her test. "

I think it was a good enough by Minfong Ho.Through on the story that you feel a little happy and a little sad, but always calm.You feel happy when they talk about all the plants and when his mother accepts plants when she bought. At first when you think the mother is going to yell at her for buying this after she failed her test. You feel bad for her but stay in a calm mood and show the girl that she wants to give up, but take her time.

Saeng silently devoted himself to herself and her mother too. Saeng decided to tell her mother what she had done, "she failed the test", probably her mother got mad at her, but then spoke to her again. Saeng Mather asks her about the plant she has with her. Saeng said she bought the factory from @ MONEY1. She was sad because she failed the test and when she buys the plant it probably makes her feel better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it brings some kind of hope to her, and she will likely pass the test. When she said "then I'll take this test again" @ CAPS1 makes her decide to take it again, it could be the crash.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wants to show readers that Saeng will want to pass his driver's license exam. The reason why the reader shows how Saeng detirmen himself after winter The example is that in the story, Saeng failed his driver's license and was sad about it. The next example is that when she finds this flow, she knows she's doing it again. This shows that the flower is helping her feel better shows that she will do it again. The first example shows that she was sad that she failed the test. At the end, the author put this statement into the story to show the reader that Saeng will later pass the diver's license test.

In Minfong Ho's Winter Hibiscus story, the author concludes the story with Saeng by saying "When they come back in the spring. When the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." The author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive ending ... his home in Vietnam. "It - it's not a real one. I mean, it's not like the kind that we had to - to - she found she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Not like the ones we had before. ”The ending sends the message that even though things are different than before, she won't give up trying to make a good life in America and won't let this change the affect

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to let us know that she will regain her self-confidence when "the hibiscus buds" and takes another place on the driver's license. He doesn't want to just leave us hanging out with the girl watching the geese fly away. The girl felt very bad for failing the test, which makes the reader sad. To cheer up the reader, he ended the story in this way. Saeng remembers his home when "the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding."    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this because she is determined to succeed at @ LOCATION1. He misses his homeland and everything in it: gardens, grandparents, etc. For example, she walked into the flower shop, she smells the flowers as if she was at home. She then smelled a flower that reminded her of her grandmothers " long gray hair, freshly washed ... "    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with "When they returned Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again." because the girl is ready to try again and not give up no matter what. The daughter is upset because she does not have the real flower that her mother had. “It's not a real one,” Saeng muttered, “I mean, not like the kind we used to be… know,” his mother said quietly. "I saw this genre blooming along the lake. The author just shows that the girl will try again next time.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story "Winter Hibiscus" with this paragraph because he wants to make the reader understand that this saeng will not give up. Saeng and his family left Vietnam and it was difficult for him to adjust to the changes. Saeng truly misses her homeland and the flowers she sees @ CAPS1 in life. She explains that the winter hibiscus is not the same as that of Vietnam so she plants this type of flower @ CAPS1 and decides to wait until spring to pass the driver's license. This shows that saeng wants to plant its difficulties in @ LOCATION2 and think about it again in the spring when the weather and the atmosphere are good. She does not die but she does not want to take the difficulties later. This is why the author concludes with this paragraph.      

<START>

 

Thank you that he uses it because she wants to have another one next year to see what it's like to love something so much and take care of it for a wial. This is why I think the narrator uses this sentence as his last sentence.

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with the paragraph she wrote as it shows how Saeng is adjusting to the change she's going through in @ LOCATION1. she takes it back. Additionally, the hibiscus will survive and as it works towards its goal, it will grow further. After the flower blooms, it will symbolize strength, helping Saeng overcome this obstacle. Her mother said the flower was not quite as pretty but would survive. She means @ LOCATION1 @ MONTH1 won't be as good as Vietnam, but Saeng will stay strong.    

<START>

 

The purpose of author @ CAPS1's ending is to show how the hibiscus gives Saeng a good sense of comfort, compared to what she was at the start of the story. It was as if she had very little self-confidence. And now she's forced to call that weird place home, and that emptied her @ CAPS2 of straining until she saw a very familiar face that brought back her memories of when she was there. Happier. Having something around that was special to her Around All the time can make @ CAPS3 feel at home or like before, she found her comfort in the Hibiscus. So now that she's resting in her garden to consistently grow through all the seasons, she will do so with this reminder of her old home and how great she felt except now with new memories.    

<START>

 

@ PERSON1 goes to the top and then over the hill.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus will be symbolic. Ho says, "Instead, she looked at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it into pieces," this makes sense because it is currently a time when Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the dead plant, he symbolically shows the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is a lot more meaning to the seasons, Ho declares, "Thanks to the silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar to her now," she realizes. that spring arrives when the plant is going to be healthy and budding, it will be able to succeed and become like a new person in a way.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he feels the audience should know what saeng is feeling. This end of the paragraph shows that saeng will continue to try each spring to regrow her flowers and it shows that Saeng has a lot of potential to make her wish come true. 

<START>

 

This story is about overcoming difficulties and disappointments as well as accepting and adjusting to the things that life has in store for people, so it is appropriate that the story ends with a purpose and a determined attitude. Throughout the reading, Saeng sought solace in things that were familiar to him, like the blossom and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurt and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. These are the things that saved her the courage she needed to retake her driving test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she ends the story by mentioning hibiscus. The last paragraph also shows that Saeng is adjusting well to his new country. She said, "When they come back ... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back ..." At first the sounds of the geese were foreign to her, but now she has accepted their horn as a normal sound. This implies that she learns to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story this way because in winter she is not used to seeing hibiscus. She is used to going outside in the garden and seeing her beautiful plant. in winter, she waits to see her plant.       

<START>

 

In the story, Saeng tries to come to terms with his new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she didn't give up. She will continue to try to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adapt but he misses his old house too much. That's why she waits until spring to try again.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with that, to let the reader guess. The she means that she is determined to live up to her past and move through it. The paragraph leaves the reader wondering if she got away with it the following year. He describes the snowmelt and the return of the geese as a change, which is exactly what she hopes to achieve. The author was trying to show how she can change and grow like her plant.    

<START>

 

The author used the conclusion with "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself in the spring, when the snowmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." She says so because when her flower starts to bud, she will be able to pass the test because she is like a flower. The author uses the conclusion because when the flower will bud and the geese come back, she will think she is home. This is why I think the author used the conclusion "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again."   

<START>

 

In winter hibiscus, teenage Saeng fails her driving test, then runs into a winter hibiscus and comes into contact with her memories. The author concludes the story by retrying the test when the geese and hibiscus buds return to show comfort and familiarity. When the speaker said "almost reluctantly she realized that a lot of things that she once considered strange had become". test. The author creates an impatient mood for the reader as it took him a winter to find this out, and winter is when it's too late, the geese are gone and the flower has closed, so when spring comes, they will be open to new opportunities and so will she be with the familiarity around her.        

<START>

 

I think she concluded with this statement because she doesn't know if she will pass but she doesn't give up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she's feeling bad and the plant has helped cheer her up, so when she sees the plant next year, she'll want to take the test. The plant is like a sign of luck. I think she ended with this paragraph because it gives you the idea of not giving up when times are tough, just keep trying.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One of the reasons is that the reader can imagine what the rest of the story would look like if it continued. For example, when the author said " then I will take this test again ". Another reason is to give the reader one last good shot to change their thinking about the story. For example when the author said "when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding". These are the reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.       

<START>

 

The author thus concludes the story because when the snow melts and the plant is budding and the geese come back, it repeats the test. It's a way for her to really think about when she's going to start over. When they come back, she will too, to take the test again.  

<START>

 

In the story, Saeng silently promised himself, "When the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, she will retest the test." For some reason, I think it's a fine idea that Saeng promised. 

<START>

 

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" probably chose to end the story this way because it then ends with a sense of hope. Also, it shows how Saeng adapts to his surroundings, much like winter hibiscus. In the penultimate paragraph, Saeng hears the tangles of the geese and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to him over time Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned as time would allow him to grow and grow. adapt even more. The hibiscus will then bud, a sign that it has overcome its obstacles and succeeded in adopting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could take inspiration from the plant. That sense of hope in Saeng and his future is left in the last paragraph, which is why the story ends there.      

<START>

 

The author concludes this paragraph from the story because, the seasons change, the plants probably do not grow during the winter. So you learn a lesson and take it as it is and wait until the next time you learn essentially the same lesson when the time comes. 

<START>

 

I think in the story "Winter Hibiscus" was a good story and also the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was to work hard and that's why he mentions at the end " I'll take the test again ”so I don't fall and stay on the ground, work hard and get up and try again.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph so that he can tell the general meaning of the story. Also, the author concludes this paragraph because it is probably a moral of the story and gives you points or events from the story that you are unfamiliar with. 

<START>

 

The story is a bit sad. The girl misses her homeland. She is also sad because she failed her driving test. The author, I think, ends the story with the girl saying that she will take the test again, to show that even though she is sad for her country and fails, she will not give up. Failure on an exam, especially a driving test, stinks. You are very excited to get it, but you don't. The author therefore tries to show that despite the sadness of the girls, she will not give up. The girl will keep trying until she finally passes away. Also, the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note, you usually don't want to leave a sad story unresolved. So she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons the author ended up the way she did, but the above are the most obvious.

In the story " Winter Hibiscus ", the story ends with this sentence to show that Saeng has goals. First, she wants to adapt to the new this new land. This is because she says when they come back in the spring which means she won't give up and try to adjust to her new life. That also says that she has precision, she will keep trying to get her license because she says, "when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will come back. this is ." She says she will try again. Also, it exploits the fact that she will have the courage to keep trying and not give up.       

<START>

 

Saeng was waiting for spring to be able to take the test again. I think it was actually spring because she was watching the geese fly in shape and seeing the plant grow but the snow was not melting yet. She's started to get her thoughts, but she might want to take a test in the spring. See if she can pass it again because she doesn't like to take the test over and over again. When everyone moves on after the test is over.

In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus” story, the main character Saeng who moved to @ LOCATION1 from Vietnam with his family has just returned from failing his driving test. For Saeng, her failure on the driving test shows that she is unable to adjust to her family's new lifestyle. She therefore feels that she has disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home, she bought a flaver that her family also had in Vietnam to try to comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter hibiscus, she feels like her mother has forgiven her for failing the driving test. Then she realized that she had adapted to her environment as she believed and that motivated her to promise to retake the driving test in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng's promise, Minfong, the author, made sure that the last most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng hasn't given up. She promised herself that she would try again and adapt to her environment unlike the others around her have adapted. His promise shows courage and perseverance.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she doesn't give up and she will pass the test again and the stelent will grow again at @ DATE1.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng says she is learning to adapt to this country. Earlier in the story, she said she failed the test because she did not impress her mother. Saeng and his mom are used to living in Vietnam, they are trying to adapt. Saeng thought the hibiscus she got was exactly like the one she had at home. In the end, she realizes that if she has just the faith, everything will be @ CAPS1 and it will be like home. She says that in the spring, because by then her hibiscus will be fully mature and she will retest to see if the hibiscus is like the one her mother thought she would get. Saeng is learning to adapt to his new country, the United States.      

<START>

 

The author concludes with this paragraph because it expresses and pursues the theme of perseverance and adaptation to change. The conclusion again mentions the " test ". From reading it can be concluded that this test the author refers to is Saeng's confrontation with the memories of the home without feeling the collapse of the loss. Saeng said earlier in the story that she "failed the test," having collapsed in tears after looking at all the familiar plants that were in the house. Concluding with this paragraph that says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. This shows the theme of perseverance as she will retake the test and try to overcome the feeling of grief.

In this story "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with, "When they returned, Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, so I will take this test again. At the beginning of the story, she was less confident and failed the test. But this flower gave her hope and the next time she takes the test, she will be better prepared.   

<START>

 

The author was concluding the essay the way he did because it sounded good to help put all the ideas together. For example, one person said, “She silently swore to herself in the spring, after the snow melted, that she would take that test again.   

<START>

 

I think the author ended the story with this sentence because every winter all or most of the plants die off, and in the spring you would have to start all over to grow that plant.

<START>

 

The author ends the story this way because he is trying to show that Saeng will be dedicated to gardening hibiscus, and once she proves herself, she will have passed the test. It also shows that she wants her inheritance to be an important part of her life by growing the flower of their nations. 

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this quote, because it shows how determined Saeng is to pass his driving test. For example, in the story " Winter Hibiscus " Saeng after failing his driving test says something to forget the fate, and she said : " Let's plant, right away ," she said this because 'she was trying to forget her failure. , and focus on something positive. In conclusion, this is why the author ends with this quote and an example of Saeng's determination and focus to pass his driving test.          

<START>

 

The author concluded the story as they did because it gave hope. Saeng had been hurt and disappointed, but in the end she had shown hope in the story. She was very disappointed. In the end, she was showing that she was not going to give up in this new country. She was going to move on and make the most of what she has.     

<START>

 

I think the author concludes with this paragraph because she is determined to complete and pass the test. The first reason is that she failed this year and wants to succeed next year. Then she compares the hibiscus to how well it passed the test. This is how the author concludes the story with this paragraph.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will try to save his next plant. The reason she says she's going to retake the test is because she sold the factory to someone. Saeng already sowed the plant in her childhood and that is why she was so attached to it. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will try to keep his next plant.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the last paragraph to show that after a while you can come back and try something again. Or maybe when the weather changes it can be different for Saeng. Maybe she relates to the plant when spring comes, the flower will be stronger, and she feels she will pass the test a second time when the geese come back and the hibiscus buds. And it also shows how she appreciates nature because otherwise, why would she wait for spring and the snow to melt. The conclusion of the story is that she loves nature, because she is about the hibiscus.

In the “ Winter Hibiscus ” story by : Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng tries to adjust to @ LOCATION1 from Vietnam. She is sad and misses her house, especially after failing her driving test. She walks past a store and recognizes a plant from her house. She buys it and brings it home in a jar. She says she thinks about the house and all the good memories she shared with a plant. Her mother then comes to share the moment with her. Saeng is feeling better now. In the final sentence, the author includes " saeng silently devoted himself to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt… and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again." »(Ho, ??) the flower has given her self-confidence and she wants to take the test again. It shows the connection she has with her house and the flowers. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan for the future by not leaving her memories but her pain.                

<START>

 

In the story " Winter Hibiscus ", the author chose to conclude the story as she did to show the comfort that the hibiscus provided and which allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for him to express his feelings about his homesickness, "and in the hot and humid shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and cried." Then, when she returned home, she again faced the reality of her test failure. I think when she failed the test it brought out how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But When Geese Fly by the author, the story ended to show how the experience made Saeng grow up. "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, I'll take the test again." I think the author wanted to show that through the events of the story she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home.        

<START>

 

I think the author ended the story with this statement because to me it looks like it will be a fresh start for herself in the spring. She tells how, when the hibiscus begins to bud, the snow is gone and her spring is when she will retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus "comes to life". It's like having a second chance and she deserves one too. When everything becomes clear again and things start to improve again and things start to look good, she will feel good to take the test again. The way she ended up with me was good. Just read on and try to figure out what she is really saying. So, practically, she states that once it all "comes back to life" she will feel like she will pass next time. Now she can be prepared.        

<START>

 

There are several reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One of the reasons is that she loves the hibiscus flower, you can tell that when she is again "When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out her hand and touched a petal gently." Another reason is that they are pretty. You can tell when she says "It was like stepping into another world ." The last reason is that she loves the gift of them. You can tell when she says " Huge flat leaves, delicate strands of tenants , ferns and fronds and viruses of all shades and shapes have grown in a seemingly random profusion. As you can see, these are the reasons the author finished with this paragraph.                           

<START>

 

The author of this story was right to conclude by saying that she would take the test again in the spring, when everything blooms. This girl has just failed her driving license, she does not want to take it right away. The blooming hibiscus symbolizes her old life in her old home and also symbolizes a new beginning when she blooms. This will give him the confidence to pass his driving test and make him excited to make a new start in the year. "Spring is when the snows melt and the geese come back". This quote from this paragraph indicates that the snow will melt and the geese will come home, just as she wants to go home and falls contible, at home you are contible. The Author ended the story of this girl, Saeng, with the hope and the will to do whatever she wants to do. That's why it was smart to end the story the way they finished it.           

<START>

 

The hibcus as the author revealed to the public is a beautiful flower which, in the story, is the memory of a young girl who failed the test knowing that she would be depressed for her failure of the test. The flower is a symbol of encouragement for the sad girl in her most tragic event and shows how a little flower comforts the girl. Daughter Saeng has vowed to demonstrate this when she gets over the sad memories. She will be able to prove that she will be successful, once she feels good about the situation she is experiencing with her destroyed life after having to come to another country where you have a @ PERCENT1 of ability and it makes sense. that the adaptation of the girl is not going to happen right away. In other words, the author's message is to motivate people who have problems in their life and that life is not giving up. Instead, you should keep working hard until you get it. In conclusion working hard and @ CAPS1 giving up is part of our life and it's up to us to overcome failure     

<START>

 

In the story, @ CAPS1 concludes the story with the line "When they come back Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take this test again." “ I think he ends it that way because she has accepted that she failed or lost, but is willing to try again to achieve her goal and 'retake this test.' Plus, she makes a promise or vow to herself and not give up on her goal.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph because they both go together there on both current things and the change of seasons. as if they didn't want to let go but they knew they would be back soon. That is why the author combined the story with the paragraph.  

<START>

 

The author expresses hope for the future in his concluding paragraph, though by simply failing his driving test and adjusting to a new atmosphere, Saeng finds solace in a Hibiscus. "It was smooth and cool with a hint of velvet towards the center - just like she had expected." This expresses that the memory of "an old friend" may have cheered him up after a previous disappointment, it was obvious that Saeng was uncomfortable in his surroundings, which his mother noticed when she arrived in the House. "She stopped, noticing the tear stains on her girlish cheeks and swollen eyes." Her daughter was not adjusting to her new atmosphere and although she had spent a lot of money on just one flower, she understood. With all the negative attitude throughout the story, once Saeng saw the geese and planted her "winter" hibiscus, she realized that what was strange to her before had now become familiar. Saeng finally realizes that with a memory of her home, her goals can be accomplished and life can be stable elsewhere than at home. It illustrates that with failure comes success.       

<START>

 

The author concluded the story in the paragraph. She doesn't want Saeng to swear the whole room where it's quite when she takes the test. 

<START>

 

She says ryt now is not a good time to drop the tst, she says she will wait to worry about it until spring, when the flowers will bloom us to do the test, @ CAPS1 she is so acentric on the exotic flowers, She can't stand doing it now, when the time is not right. So she says she will wait until the time is right to take the test.   

<START>

 

Saeng will take the test in the spring when it won't be so cold. She loves it when the hibiscus is budding, it smells so good. Their good smell reminds him of his native land. Saeng loves fried melon, it leaves a golden aftertaste on the tongue. She would put it on a Big Mac.    

<START>

 

There are many reasons why the author ends the story with this paragraph.

<START>

 

The author included this concluding paragraph because the hibiscus shows Saeng "solace in his discomfort". She might feel more comfortable when the hibiscus is budding because she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her that she failed the test the first time because she was comfortable with to be in a new place. But when spring comes, she will be more confident and at ease as the hibiscus is budding.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because earlier in the story, saeng explained how she had failed the test, in which she wanted to retake. So, saeng said that next year when the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, she will retest. 

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes this paragraph is to show saeng that she will wait for them to grow back and try again for her test. Hibiscus means a lot to her and will continue to try because she doesn't want her mother to be disappointed with her anymore. Example of when saeng was ashamed “ her mother looked at her in disbelief. But how could you ? " Saeng does not demean himself or his mother. "saeng swore silently" by promising that she will pass and respect nature as well as the elders       

<START>

 

In minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus”, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: “When they return, Saeng silently dedicates himself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will retake the test, ”the @ CAPS1 author concludes the story this way, because it's kind of a cliffhanger. In the story, @ CAPS2 is upset that she failed her driving test and has just moved from Vietnam to the United States so she is a bit homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she buys it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up ??? reminiscent of the resemblance of plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng has not given up and is going to retry the driver's license exam. But what you don't know is the end result of whether or not she succeeds and so it's a cliffhaofer. This is why the author ended the story this way.        

<START>

 

Saeng suffered a tragic loss in his family and also a move to a whole different world . The paragraph is symbolic of turning a new leaf and starting over.The " melting snows " and " hibiscus tenders" are both symbolized new life. Saeng is going to have a outlook on life and accept his situation to make the best of it. Further, the author says that "the winter hibiscus was in the ground now" as it compares to the new outlook of saengs planted on life. Like the flower, a seed of hope has been planted in Saeng, and now it is ready to bloom.                                                                                              

<START>

 

In the story “Winter hibiscus” by @ ORGANIZATION1, the author is very sentimental towards the Hibiscus plant because it reminds him so much of his home. The reason the author concluded the story with this saying was because it gave him a purpose. She once failed to find a job, but she @ MOIS1 thinks Hibiscus is lucky, so she sets herself a goal when trying the job again. When she saw the plant, she recalled happy memories. In conclusion, some things can trigger your memories, but it's the good memories that make things in life something to look forward to and hope for.    

<START>

 

The author ends the story this way for several reasons. It first shows that she is starting to love this new life. It is also an end that is open. This shows that she loves her new life for several reasons. "She realized that a lot of things that she thought were strange before had become… almost familiar now", that's when she begins to see that her new life in @ LOCATION1 is not not so bad. It's about geese and it's referred to when she promises to take the test. It also shows how important the hibiscus she just planted is already to her. The second thing he does is dream of future conclusions. The reader is not sure if she will pass the test next time, but assumes that she will because of the way she pronounces it. This is why the author ends this story as they did. To show how she feels in her new life and to leave an opening for people to draw conclusions.          

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story, she is failing the driver's license, so they added that she was going to take it back. And maybe the plant is or would bring him luck after the snow melts and the geese return, that would be a fresh start. It would also be good after she discovered the plant.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the paragraph with this paragraph because she wants to try again. The author says the hibiscus she planted @ DATE1 didn't work and she tries this @ DATE1 again to grow a hibiscus plant. She will pass the test if she passes in the spring. This is why the author concludes with this paragraph.   

<START>

 

He concludes that in the spring, he will retake the test. This will give him another chance to pass it. It will give him another chance to do what is right.  

<START>

 

She will take the test against @ CAPS1, she needs it and she @ CAPS2 when the snow melts and the geese are back, that means she wants to take it in the spring.  

<START>

 

In "Winter Hibiscus" the phrase from author @ CAPS1 is "When they come back Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again. ". thinks that remembering home will help her pass the test.She uses geese and plants to remind her of home and having this environment makes her feel comfortable

<START>

 

Just as the hibiscus flower prevails in winter, saeng wants to be the same. Saeng failed a test, which makes her feel unsuccessful. Saeng wants to win, she wants to hang on and the difficult times she's going through makes it very difficult for her. When Saeng says " I failed the test " it shows that Saeng is disappointed that she did not expect it because she is a fighter. So the author ends the passage by saying " When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again." To show how much of a fighter Saeng is because she is determined to fight in tough conditions.         

<START>

 

The author puts this paragraph last because it shows that saeng is almost looking for a new lease of life. Now she has something to take her through the year ahead, now she is waiting until it is winter again to see the hibiscus flower bloom again and many more to come. 

<START>

 

In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus” story, I think she concludes the story in this way to show that even if Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, symbolized one day by the return of the geese. Saeng is sad because she misses her homeland and she sees plants that bring back memories to her, so she buys a winter hibiscus to soothe her, comfort her and remind her of her home. 

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with a paragraph because she loves her garden. She concludes it because the story is about then and their garden and it ends up getting cold, leaving them nothing to do until spring. This suggests that they have strong feelings for what they are doing, as it says "In the spring when the snow falls and the geese come back and this budding hibiscus" hears that she wants to take the time to overcome. and prove that she can take care of her garden.  

<START>

 

At that point, she vowed to take a test again because the flowers would always come and go, but her grades will only be there once for her schoolwork. Instead, she prefers to garden and then do her homework.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus gave him some hope. Plus, because his mother was understanding about his failure to test. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.               

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with optimism and hope for the future. She ends her story with "When they come back Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take the test again." By concluding the story this way, it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant has given him after failing his driving test. The hibiscus allowed Saeng to adjust to his new home. It is said in the story. Almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of the things she had thought about before were weird, through the season-to-season stoppage rehearsal being almost similar to her now. The way the author ends the story helps inspire a new beginning and a new season.      

<START>

 

In the story @ ORGANIZATION1, from Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng tries to adjust to a new country, but it's almost impossible. She's stressed out about failing the driving test, country, but she does and she realizes that nothing is ever the same. Except for one thing that she quickly recognized. A plant called " Winter Hibiscus ". It made him think of his old life in Vietnam. He helped her whole through hard time and she didn't want to give up anythings.This is exactly why Minfong Ho ends the last paragraph by stating that Saeng retries the driving test when the hibiscus is budding.The flower gives her a thought of her home in Vietnam, making her try and try again. In addition, the author ends the story like this to state a theme. That particular theme is, “No matter how difficult something can be , you can get away with it. You just have to find a way that benefits you the most.                                                                                                                                                                           

<START>

 

The author returns to this paragraph because in the story, Saeng is so sorry that she did not @ CAPS1 the test. Now saeng wants to catch up, she has sworn to do @ CAPS1 this test. For example, when I tell myself I'm going to do my own thing, I do whatever it takes to get it done and I don't give up when the going gets tough, @ CAPS3, That last sentence is the main idea of the story is, to do this test and @ CAPS1, to do what needs to be done  

<START>

 

The reason this author includes this story with this paragraph is because he always talks about saeng and it sounds more like her and she has a mind like a butterfly that got trapped and burst with that opening that the Saeng and his mother had but a tennage daughter me and saeng we are kind of related to the same thing.

<START>

 

In Minfong Ho's “Winter Hibiscus” story, I think the last paragraph is there to show that Saeng didn't give up. She said, "When they come back… then I'll take this test again." She talks about hibiscus and geese. Things that remind him of home. When reminders from home come to give her strength, she will have the power to pass the test. It shows that even if she failed, she won't give up and she will try again. I think that's the point of the paragraph. To show that Saeng hasn't given up.        

<START>

 

The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because he tells the reader that after the snow leaves, the author will start to plant more plants. The test is to make sure his plants do not die off during the next @ DATE1. 

<START>

 

In the story " Winter Hibiscus " by @ CAPS1 Ho. The author states that Saeng is happy when she is around the plant and finds peace with the plant as it brings back memories of childhood. For example "And that rich, sweet scent, that was a familiar ton." She loved the way she felt. When one of the leaves fell and she took a breath, it reminded her of Grandma. @ CAPS1 might have experienced something like this. @ CAPS1 maybe wrote this because the story might relate to other people who have moved from another country and have something that reminds them of memories. Every time I touch or smell a sweater, it brings back memories of my grandmother. I think he wrote this because of his personal experience and it might relate to others          

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it wants to show how some people silently made a wish because they didn't want to express themselves. Maybe also because they are not even very foggy with people. One day I was like that, I didn't want to talk to anyone. All I want is to sit in my room and think. Think about my life where I will go after I die. I would just be sitting in my room in the dark, wondering if my room in the dark I myself would ask if I would come back in another body or my soul would travel the land. But I think I'm starting to think I'm a kid, I have a wonderful head. I when I get to the one I need to think about then I would. So I started talking to everyone again                  

<START>

 

The author concludes this story by saying this statement because he wants you to feel like the character in the book is determined. The ator tries to pass a pass statement and then try again. The character does not give up and she will pass the test even if it is difficult.    

<START>

 

The author talks about gardening and how she wants to improve in the spring. She probably thinks she's bad at gardening because her mom is really good at it and she wants to be just as good at gardening. 

<START>

 

The reason is that you get the impression that Saeng enjoys gardening. She prays that spring will come so that she can start again. She enjoys watching plants grow and become something you can eat. This is how the author concluded the story with this paragraph.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show his determination and hope. Geese and hibiscus symbolize the determination of saeng, as they always come back no matter what. Saeng will be back to take the test, just as the geese will be back as well. The hibiscus also symbolizes it because it has also faced adversity. He's been brought to new rhythms and had new homes, much like saeng, and a harsh winter is coming in the near future. However, he still finds a way to come back and bloom in the spring, which saeng hopes to do by passing the driving test. The author has included the last paragraph to show the symbolism between saeng , geese, and hibiscus. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.                           

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is essentially trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason can mean throughout the seasons. She @ MOIS1 thinks she would have better on her test in the spring just for the simple fact that everything blooms in the spring. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she can overcome these obstacles even if she has left her home country. It also shows that she is more confident in herself, which is why the author concluded her story with this paragraph. 

<START>

 

“When they come back, Saeng silently devoted himself to spring. When the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again. I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph is that what happens to his life that he will pass the test again. But in the story he's talking about. One of the flowers had fallen and Saeng picked it up carefully and smelled it. So I think they take care of their garden and try to keep it alive in the winter. So that's what I think of the last paragraph, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese come back and his hibiscus buds, then I'll take that test again."      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this because this paragraph basically sums up the whole story. “When the snow melts and the geese come back” basically goes back to the beginning of the story when saeng started planting. That is why the author gave the conclusion to the story.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. First, the test is important for Saeng so that she can prove to herself that she is capable of passing it. The end of this paragraph also gives the reader some suspense as to whether Saeng will pass or even retake the test. Finally, this paragraph shows Saeng's personality traits. This shows that she is persistent, determined and willful.    

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus" at the end of the story, the author writes "When they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, In the spring, when the snow will melt and the geese will return and this hibiscus will bud, then I'll take the Test again. " The reason the author said this is because she is trying to tell readers to get up and start over, if you've fallen once, it's okay and try again. When it's springtime and the birds aren't flying south, she promises to pass the driving test. After failing a driving test, Saeng buys a flower from a florist that reminds him of Vietnam. She brings it home and puts it in the garden. She told her mother that she failed, Saeng's mother was very understanding and told her maybe next time.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story this way so that she can keep everyone in the question. I believe she finished this way to let us know that she will be back and when she comes back she will be ready for anything including this test. She left us wondering because when she comes back she will want to use to read what happened when she got back and what happened when she @ CAPS1 tested it. She only made that wish to herself to no one else because if she had, she would have let them down if she had failed. That's why she concludes the story this way.    

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this because she says she will be there next year to take the test again. She says how she wants to be there when the plants are growing. She especially wants to see the hibiscus grow. Because she appreciates and loves nature so much, she wants to be there again to watch them grow up.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this last paragraph to show how sentimental and important the plant is to Saeng. She will take this test again at the end of winter because it is too cold for the beautiful hibiscus to survive. You need a winter hibiscus. “Not like the kind we had before” (@ NUM1). This shows how important it is for her to find a hibiscus like the ones she had at home. She shows disappointment in herself until this last paragraph where she shows courage and strong will.     

<START>

 

When they come back, Saeng vowed to shut in the spring when the snow melts and the geese will come back and this hibiscus sprout, then I 'll come back this test. The author concluded this story in such a way that the reader wonders much more vividly in the "@ CAPS1's @ ORGANIZATION1" when there was a modernist way of interpreting the means of a pigsty by asking questions to the drive instead as a moral to the story. For example, in "@ CAPS1's @ ORGANIZATION1", the main character @ PERSON1 runs away and everyone could have a door slammed. A lot of life in this story, there is a twist in the fact that which test is the main character talking about? trying to move ww friends? does living a resolution that she takes? It also leaves the reader wanting more of the story so they @ MOIS1 will come back and even read it again.

“ Winter Hibiscus ” is a truly sad, yet hopeful story that uses many symbols. The author concluded the story with a confident ending that satisfies the reader. The two reasons he wrote this concluding paragraph are to give the end a hopeful tone and to connect the objects she sees in the spring.

It also reveals how strong Saeng is. The author uses this concluding paragraph to leave the reader with an optimistic and confident tone.

The author concluded the story with the sentence, because the author wanted to show that since Saeng found the flower, she has new hope and a new reason to take the test. The flower gave her inspiration because it reminded her of her home in Vietnam "I mean, not like the kind we had at home" She found she was still too shaky to say the words home "When Saeng brought the plant to her new home and planted it in the garden, it was like bringing home a little piece of Vietnam that made her feel better.

Saeng had become sad because she remembered her home in Vietnam. She longed for her natural home and familiarity. Her missed memories hurt Saeng excruciatingly because she was now gone and in a different world. However, the author began to reveal clues that @ ORGANIZATION1 would accept @ LOCATION2 and also find childhood memories there. "Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew, their weak horns clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now." Saeng was already familiarizing himself with his surroundings at @ LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would keep her culture, tradition and @ CAPS1 memories alive, as the geese would help her feel happy and used to @ LOCATION2. As one kept her @ CAPS1 and “@ CAPS3 culture alive through her memories, she would continue a successful life and pass her test.

In "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho, the author's goal by concluding the story with "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding , so I'll do this test again ", was to show how the hibiscus and other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng walks into the store, she is overwhelmed by the number of things she had forgotten to experience in Vietnam. “Plants that she hadn't even realized she knew but had forgotten brought her back to the world of her childhood.” It was then that Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant that she knows in a pot, she says to herself, " How strange it is to sit in a pot at home, it has grown in the wild, sticking out of cracks. brick walls or between the filed roofs. "This symbolizes her, because outside her home, she seems to feel strangled. nge and caged too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng brings it home, is described by his mother as strong enough to get through the cold months ”. Saeng identified with this description and therefore decided that when the hibiscus is done taking care of the bad things, it will also have budded and grown like its plant. Then she will be ready to achieve her goal.           

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again. Saeng thinks that if hibiscus can survive hard times and adapt to changes, and survive, she can too. Saeng icoms that even though she moved to the United States and it's different, she is strong enough to survive. her driving test means she is incapable of anything but trying again with a fresh start like hibiscus.

The author concludes the story with this @ CAPS1 that the author wants to show that Saeng has not given up. Easily in the story, Saeng goes to the greenhouse and starts to cry. When she comes home, she says to her mother, “ I failed the test ”. @ CAPS1 of this Saeng wanted to go back and try again. This is why the author ended with this paragraph.      

<START>

 

The last paragraph has been added to represent the determination and adaptation to new things of Saeng and his family. At first, Saeng was bitter about failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower, she accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, it will be a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her determination to face it is that she makes friends and although the food she offered was rejected, she did not give in. The moment of the rupture was when she received the flower. After her return home, it was over and she accepts the change again.     

<START>

 

The author has included the last paragraph because Saeng is not going to give up. and she will try again. I think Saeng bought the flower because she had them in her house and it will help her. For example, Saeng started to cry because he misses his homeland.   

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he thinks that when the flowers return, they would be beaten. I think he thinks it would be a better test next time 

<START>

 

The author concludes “ Winter Hibiscus ” with the paragraph as it continues the theme of adaptation to life changes. In the story, Saeng came from Vietnam to the United States and that's quite a change. The plants have also been modified. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, but it's different. The mother of the story says, “Her flowers aren't that pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the cold winter months here, that winter hibiscus. “The hibiscus is also linked to the theme because it is able to adapt to changes. The last paragraph talks about melting snow, returning geese and budding hibiscus. These are all the changes the author uses to log into the theme. It adds more understanding to the story's message. Plus, the tone of the last paragraph is hopeful which gives the reader a positive feeling. The tone adds to the theme of the story.

I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph given to show that she looks like hibiscus and geese. First, geese and hibiscus both have one purpose, which is to survive winters. Geese fly south during the winter to stay warm. It's similar to Saeng worse thing both moved to a different environment where they have to adapt. In addition, Saeng must live the winter with the hibiscus. The hibiscus must be strong, to overcome the winter, it shows that Saeng is like her hibiscus because she must be strong to overcome the ordeal. If her hibiscus can overcome her ordeal in winter, then she can survive to eat away at hers.      

<START>

 

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" mentions "when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will do the test again as it shows that it can adapt to change and can still also thinks about her old country. An example of how she can keep her old country alive in her life is "But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted, much preferred it over a Big Mac. “ It shows that she can still eat the foods she ate in her old home and try new things in her new home. In conclusion, the excerpt shows that the author can put the two cultures together and be happy.   

<START>

 

There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could be historically significant. I think the author includes this to say that when spring comes she will have a lot more reasons to get the driver's license. You can break this paragraph down to mean a lot of different things. I interpreted it to mean that when spring returns, she will have a fresh start. The snowmelt represents all the hardships it faced the previous year. The return of geese and the budding of hibiscus means that they are also coming back to start the New Year. They too are coming back, preparing to begin their new life. It's included at the end to show how Saeng tries to forget how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she takes the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all the bad things she went through the previous year. She needed to move on and be able to take the driving test next time. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve his problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas of what it is trying to say. I think this shows @ CAPS1 a fresh start that she will have to go through next year.              

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with the phase "when they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again" J 'm saying they'll be ready for them the next time they come back.

<START>

 

The author ended the "Winter Hibiscus" story with Saeng promising to take the test again. He finished it that way to show the themes of this story. One of the themes of the story is never to give up. The Winter Hibiscus must get through the long winter, but it survives and prompts Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to bloom. Saeng wants to overcome his obstacles and pass the test. Therefore, the end of the story displays the themes.       

<START>

 

The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a bit. Like when Saeng said she was lying when the plants came back. It also gave the end a little something to hang out with, rather than talking about v or geese to take the reader off the topic. Finally, she also lies when the geese have returned.   

<START>

 

I think the author finished the story with this @ CAPS1 girls see this plant as a symbol of righteousness and faith so she will pass the test next year When she comes back @ CAPS1 she really loves the plant And she hopes she will bring him run out of.

<START>

 

I think the author ended the story with this sentence to show that she won't give up; no matter how hard it is, she keeps trying. The girl says in the story " I failed the test " and then at the end of the story she says I will take this test again so that she is not ready to fail forever. I also think the author ended the story with this paragraph to make you wonder if she will ever pass the test.     

<START>

 

I think the author is writing this because whatever test she has to take she wasn't ready before, but now whenever the geese and hibiscus come back she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasn't mentally prepared. So I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus are coming back she will pass the test and maybe she was not physically and mentally prepared for it.  

<START>

 

The authors have carefully chosen their last paragraphs. The author chose to end his story with this paragraph because everything the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special to the characters. There are reasons the author chose to end the story with this paragraph. The choice of the authors of the end paragraph is very important. The character says "this hibiscus is budding, so I'll take this test again." The hibiscus she mentions represents the ability to overcome obstacles. In the story, it is about the girl who overcomes the failed test and takes it again. This is why the author concludes with this. The author also writes. “ When the snow melts and the geese come back ” This represents new beginnings and new opportunities for the character. This gives the character the feeling that next time she will pass the test. The author adds this paragraph at the end to symbolize new beginnings and opportunities and the ability to overcome obstacles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author has done it too. The author did this to symbolize things.

<START>

 

I believe the author ended the story with this paragraph because the geese that flew south in a nice formation @ CAPS1, fly down every season. So she says to herself @ CAPS2, she will take the test again when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. For example, she says to herself, "Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she once considered strange before had become, through the silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar now." @ CAPS2, looking at the geese, she almost remembers an experience she had in a somewhat similar way.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph, "When they returned, Saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will repeat this test to point out that you can overcome defeat or failure until the "season" returns so you can endure again. Basically the hibiscus (a plant) meant a lot to the narrator and his dying mother and they dug a hole for help him to grow, so when he pushes back, it proves that he will live better. So when Saeng recounts the ordeal, it will be she who will have the opportunity to pass the ordeal. The story with this paragraph symbolizing a fresh start about to take place. actually means a situation that will come back that will help you get what you need that you missed. The story and paragraph focus on what life is about point of initiating a cycle.

The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng, like geese and hibiscus, will return and have hope. Saeng is a bit depressed in the story because she's in a new country and just failed her driving test. The florist's hibiscus plant brings back painful emotional memories to her, but at the same time, it is very heartwarming. Later in the story, she plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother. As his mother walks inside, Saeng watches the geese fly above his head. Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things she once considered strange had become to her, thanks to the silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar. Like geese. Saeng knew that the geese. geese would return in the spring, just as she would on her driving test. The hibiscus would be in bloom again too to give her hope. That's what the last paragraph of the story " Hibiscus" means. winter ”.           

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the eternal determination of saeng. This idea of her determination to be successful can be traced back to the plant she brings home. The plant she knew grew wild where she lived, but she found it potted in the United States, which limits her growth, just as the new land of saeng seems unusual, and she feels moved.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with Saeng by telling herself that she will take the test again because it brings together the general theme and the main actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty and similarities in it to your old home. Saeng said that "many things that she once considered strange had become, through the silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar to her now as geese." And when she is in the greenhouse, the plants bring back memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng had a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @ LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just as she had overcome the differences between @ LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and taking the test again as it shows all the ways Saeng is adjusting to his new life and showing him, as well as the reader, that she can overcome new things. She swears to herself that she can do it and foreshadows her future, her success and her adaptation to a @ CAPS1 lifestyle.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did because it was the end and the beginning of a new beginning. The author uses the senses in his story. Winter is the current season and spring is coming. Although Saeng failed her test in the winter when most things die off, she looks forward to spring to retry her test. The geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show that spring is here with new life. Saeng will also have new life in his test to pass it this time around and drive. Spring will come and a new life will be offered to all.

This paragraph is a good way to end the story because it relates to the test. The narrator says she will try again in the spring.

The story "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho. The author concludes the story in a paragraph that seems incomplete. Daughter Saeng swears to pass her driving test when spring comes. When Saeng held the plant, she felt cold and helpless like the plant. “Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves were shaking in the wind. Glad you had it.” @ CAPS1 mother also said, “Look how it's tied to the root, poor thing. Somehow describes Saeng clinging to staying in touch with his country. to survive. When spring comes, the plant will be just as strong, and so will Saeng. This is why the author stops where she did  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story by showing the link of the young girl with the plant and the symbolism of the geese, " winter hibiscus " is her link with her homeland. She said she will retake her driving test when her plant is budding and being brave, so she will. The geese flying south show her journey as a person as she will pass the test when the geese return from their journey, as she returns from hers.    

<START>

 

The author wrote the end paragraph as she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is that she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. Throughout the story there was a depressing nogistic tone that made the reader dream of the past tense. The author wanted to emphasize being strong even if @ MONTH1 you don't like where you are at. The author also wanted to show the strength of the main character Saeng. Even though she just failed a test in a strange new world, she still wants to keep moving forward. This adds more dimension to the character and makes him less static and more dynamic. This is a great story to read if you're homesick and need something to get you going.       

<START>

 

The author concludes with this statement because it shows that she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to take root in the new soil it is on. When she is in the orchard, she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but feeling good at the same time.  

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes this passage from the story to show the patinas. Saeng had to wait for spring, maybe she will return to her hometown. She prefers spring to winter. She loves the birds that the geese come back to in the spring. They disappear in winter. In this way, I believe the author concludes this passage.     

<START>

 

"When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take this test again." The author left his home and moved to another country. She is now in an unknown location. Everything around him now is new and for the most part unknown. By ending the story with this quote, it suggests that the author still has hopes of adjusting to his new home. When she left her home, she didn't just leave a building behind. She left her home, the people she loved and an endless list of memories. Sometimes @ MONTH1 felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now "out of the box" and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant brought her back to her memories and love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and parted with sadness and "failed her test." The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own coping test.            

<START>

 

The author concludes that the story with the paragraph "when they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself., In the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again" means that she will pass the test and hoped to pass so that she could make her mother happy and support her. She chose spring because spling is the rebirth of nature and Saeng would like to repeat the test with a clear and clean mind. I think this is the reason the author chose to put the paragraph at the end of the story.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several important reasons. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with and overcomes his past. The paragraph helps to end the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus, she tells her mother that she couldn't help it and that she couldn't get over her past. Saeng said, "I failed the test." When she says " the test " she means the ability to face and overcome the loss of her grandmother and her homeland. In the last paragraph, Saeng says she will take the test again. She said, " When the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, I'll take this test again." " In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to close the story and emotional barriers Saeng faces.

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since moving to the United States, she has been homesick. To make matters worse, she failed the driving test. “She realized that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “This quote helps add homesickness to the girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she will start fresh and relive her life at @ LOCATION2.

In the Winter Hibiscus story written by @ CAPS1 Ho. The narrator goes to a greenhouse which has a lot of flowers but one in particular catches her attention. A 'winter' Hibiscus plant. This plant reminds her of her homeland and everything that was going on there, this plant also reminds her of her grandmother's long silky gray hair and how she would watch it dry it in the sun and then help him tie it into a ton with a bud of that plant in it. The author ends the story with this because it contradicts her statement when she says "I failed the test." and the end of this passage says "..., then I will take the test again".               

<START>

 

In the story "Winter Hibiscus", the daughter Saeng @ CAPS1 the pilot test "I failed the test" Saeng said. She had bought a hibiscus because the flower reminded her of some of the memories of the house and the hibiscus she had at home. at the end she says she will take the test again when the geese come back, the snow has melted and the hibiscus is budding. I think she does this because she needs time to think, remember her home, and create a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is like Saeng. They both did something wrong or @ CAPS1 something Saeng failed the test and the hibiscus was reduced to a pot. But they're both going to change the wrong thing.

In the story “ Winter Hibiscus ” by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in this way to convey the determination and new motivation that Saeng found in purchasing the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, found a plant that reminded her of her home, and her grandmother motivated her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country a workout for the better, whatever happens. “She lifted her head and watched their distinctive u burn against the evening sky…” the author included details of the geese to represent the passage. The geese will leave and return, as will Saeng. She failed the test the first time around, but having the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. "Almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of things she had previously considered strange had become… familiar to her." Geese were one of the things mentioned that became very familiar to her in her new home. Concluding the trip with a bit of geese tells the reader that she is slowly but surely learning to adjust to her strange new home. Finding the plant helped her, as it was already familiar to her. “Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost visceral. '@ CAPS1, Saeng said.' “After failing her driving test, walking into the florist and finding this plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at the beginning. The geese had become familiar over time and finding the plant was nothing short of heartwarming. Concluding the story this way showed the reader that she was adjusting and learning to cope with a difficult situation in a heartwarming way.

In MiNFOnG HO's “WiNter Hibiscus” story, the author concludes the story with “when they come back saeng silently swore to each other, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again ". The author concluded the story with this @ CAPS1 because she says that when the year starts OFF @ CAPS2 and starts over, she will too. She says when the geese @ CAPS3 come back the snow melts and the hibiscus starts budding that they all start over and start a @ CAPS2 BEGINNING. So when she goes to take the test, it will be a @ CAPS2 year.   

<START>

 

The author of Winter Hibiscus ended his story with some words regarding the story @ CAPS1 failed his driving test. Saeng cried as he noticed his past through the flower. In addition to the purchased dok malik seeds, the story ended as it did, because next season  

<START>

 

 The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng is determined. She says she will take the test again, which shows that she is determined. Even if saeng failed her driving test, she won't quit.  

<START>

 

The author used this phrase because the snow is melting and the geese are coming back. The flowers were growing and that's why I think the author used this phrase. Written by @ ORGANIZATION1  

<START>

 

I think it was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says "When they come back," she is talking about the flowers. When they come back alive. "In the spring" indicates when the flower will return. "When the snows melt and the geese come back" she says after winter (when the snows melt) and when the geese come back (in spring). “And this Hibiscus is budding,” she says when the flowers bloom again in the spring. " Then I'll take the test again, " she said after everything that happened, she will take the test again (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching everything that happens and counting down until spring, so that she can retake the test. She is ready for spring, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @ CAPS1. This will be his goal for winter, until spring!        

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with this ending because in the spring when everything blossoms. And she wouldn't be focused while there is snow. So when the hibiscus buds, that's when she can take her test again. I think he wrote this because it means something to her.   

<START>

 

This conclusion of the story gives a sense of hope for the future. The young girl is upset that she failed the test, but still has hopes for what will happen next. In the story, the narrator says, "She lifted her head." This quote shows that she is not going to give up and give up, but that she will try until she is successful. The story's conclusion leaves readers wondering if she'll put in more effort and pass the test for the second time. When she says " when the snow melts and the geese come back " it shows us that she is like the geese because they both return for a hand fought trip. Also, when she says " and that budding hibiscus " she says that when everything comes to life and is at its peak, she will pass the test because she will have the most self-confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset that she failed the test, she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring.            

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons.

<START>

 

Saeng is @ CAPS1 it will be a long time before she recovers from schoolwork. this is why the author concludes the story with his paragraph. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because he wants to emphasize that the girl is not completely dissatisfied with leaving her home. He ended with it because he wanted her to hope she learns to love his new home. 

<START>

 

The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before resuming the test. Saeng compares himself to indifferent things; Flowers and take a test. It is important. This is why the author ends the story with this sentence.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. The next time it blossoms, the girl will be ready for the test and take it again and pass. The author wants to show that the girl will not give up and will try again to make sure that she passes. The author uses the hibiscus to show that the girl and the girl will bloom at the same time as the hibiscus passes and passes the test.     

<START>

 

Well, I think the author concludes the story with this line because maybe Saeng loves spring and can focus better with her favorite flower which she thinks is linked to her life.

<START>

 

The author ends the story like this to show that the theme is working hard. Other examples of hard work are "winter hibiscus".

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it's the same thing they opened the story with. To introduce the story, the author relates that Saeng failed her driving test and then saw a familiar plant that she wishes to purchase. The middle of the story goes that she struggles to adjust to her new home. So, to wrap up the story, the author says that Saeng will take his driving test again, once the flowers start to bud and the geese come out. The flower and the geese remind her of home, so it tells you that thinking about her home and the things that make her feel at home comforts her and helps her overcome obstacles.     

<START>

 

Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these techniques, an @ MONTH1 story looks bland, average or unappealing. Author Minfong Ho sees that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of just declaring the fact that she will take the test again, he makes her make a promise on the geese that she will. The author ended the story like this to show how confident she was about the test.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it relates the hibiscus to the trials and triumphs of saeng. How saeng can't give up. Hibiscus are a symbol of hope and saeng considers them to be his hope. Throughout history, hibiscuses are comforting to saeng because they remind him of his home. The author includes it because a lot of people can relate to it and find hope in things. For saeng, knowing that every year the hibiscus will come back under these conditions reassures her that she will do just as well.      

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show a fresh start. The geese come back to resume their life, the hibiscus will bloom, and she will retake the test. At first, Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and her grandmother. Saeng began to feel, "A wave of loss so deep and so strong that it stung Saeng's eyes has now swept it away." She remembered that some of these plants grew wild in the bushes or between the cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng says what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she has found solace and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past have shown her the way and now she is going to retake her driving test.       

<START>

 

I think the author concludes this story with this end paragraph because the story is about how she feels comforted in the plants and she wants to wait until the weather dawns and the geese come back to take her test. I think she wants to wait that way, she will be more comfortable with her surroundings and she can clear her mind and do her best for the test.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng wants to retest, but she wants to retest when everything else is good and happy like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says "When they (the geese) come back… and this hibiscus is budding, I will do the test." It shows his maturity and his happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe not even fun when everything else comes back and is happy. Just like when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and the plant come back, she wants to help them get through this and make them happy too. That way, they can all be happy at the same time.

The short story " Winter Hibiscus " as written by author Minfong Ho ends with the main character Saeng, promising herself that in the spring when the geese come back and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, she retake his failed driving test. Mingfong Ho, writes this story, with heavy imagery and symbolism, the hibiscus found in the flower shop, represents a bond for Saeng to his homeland, and the bitter melon, which is loved by Saeng, but unbearable to people. from @ LOCATION1, represents Saeng struggling to connect with people at @ LOCATION1. And for Saeng, the budding hibiscus and returning geese represent a new opportunity to pass his driving test and better adapt to life at @ LOCATION1.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted to show that Saeng doesn't give up and that nature gives strength to @ CAPS1. The conclusion shows that Saeng isn't giving up by saying she will retake the test, even though she failed it earlier today. Also, it shows that nature gives strength to Saeng by saying that Saeng will retake the test when the geese come back, when the hibiscus buds and when the snow melts in spring nature gives him strength as it reminds him of the place. where they lived and her grandmother. . In conclusion, the author concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not a coward and that nature gives her strength and confidence.   

<START>

 

The character, Saeng, experiences both internal and external conflicts. Saeng had failed his driving test and still failed Vietnam. The end of the story was a great choice of ending for the story. The flock of geese @ CAPS1 represented its changes. She used to walk awkwardly and out of places. A lot of things were new to her. Saeng realized that life was not that bad for her. Planting "winter hibiscus" also represented its change. It showed how she was going to start over and continue happily. Saeng will "plant a new seed". The ending was well chosen for the story as it foreshadows Saeng's future. The story is inspiring and the ending contributes greatly to the effect.           

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng relates the hibiscus overcoming of problems to his own overcoming of problems. Saeng compares the hibiscus to herself. If the hibiscus can adapt to its surroundings, then so can it. And if the hibiscus overwinters, it too can; and she will retake the test she failed before. Plus, before that, she says things that were once strange to her now looked familiar to her, like geese. She then sees them flying in a V. They also adapt to their surroundings by flying to a warmer place, and Saeng can adapt as well.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this sentence, because she is excited about the return of spring so that she can plant more things and watch them blossom and come to life.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it shows that Saeng will not give up. Saeng failed her driving test and on her way home she found a hibiscus. It reminds him of his old home. Saeng goes to the greenhouse or the flower shop and buys one. On her return, she plants the hibiscus. The hibiscus keeps him from giving up. When it starts to bud, @ PERSON1 will retake the test.      

<START>

 

The author has chosen this paragraph to put it at the end because it is then that everything will be perfect to redo his mistake. Saeng said, crying, “ I failed the test ! " @ CAPS1 means it has failed in this for what she thought was right. "Here, let me help mum" get up and remove her mum's shovel. Saeng is trying to get better at gardening, so when she starts doing her mistake again, she will do better. As the reader can see, Saeng wants to pass the test, so she can believe that she is a great gardener like her mother.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes people want to read the following story to see how she finishes the test. In the story, she failed the test now that she has changed, she wants to retake the test because she knows she can do @ PERSON1 now than before. 

<START>

 

Because everything in that paragraph is somewhere in history. So it really intertwines. She learns to adapt to her new native land as the plant doses.   

<START>

 

I would say the author concluded this story at the end of the paragraph because they wanted to be very consistent. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and a very good understanding of the text. In a few words.  

<START>

 

The reason they include the story with the paragraph is because they are talking about the same thing. Then they probably included the story with the paragraph that could have shown the good relationship between mother and daughter and how they can do things together. Then in the story, they talk about going to Canada together.  

<START>

 

The author decides to end the story with this paragraph to show Saeng's strength and confidence. Saying that she would try to take the test again in the spring shows that she is confident and looking for a new start to come. Also, he concludes it this way because after failing the test, she didn't have much self-confidence. And once she spoke to her mother and knew she understood, Saeng knew she had to try again and persevere until she passed the test.   

<START>

 

I think when she takes the test on she is going to be in the spring and she is going to be going to try and pass it. But she does n't want to cry in front of her mother . I think she is going to do this up to him and take the test.                                                                                                                                                 

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show readers that she was knocked down but will get up and take the test again. This is also a really good way to end the story as it shows that she is very determined to pass this test and that she will not give up and will do anything to pass it. 

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it shows that she won't give up and that she will when she is ready. The reason I say this is because she takes the test when she wants to, when she feels comfortable. These are the reasons why I believe the author ended the story with this paragraph.  

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perseverance. Saeng says, "through the silent season-to-season rehearsal, which is almost familiar to him now." This statement represents adaptation to change. Soon she will fully adjust to her new home, it just takes time. In the last paragraph, Saeng said, " When the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." " As the season brings things she will return. I believe that last paragraph was put in to show that everyone should persevere because things take time.     

<START>

 

This statement shows what the author concludes about the story. It really shows the theme of the story. If you fail, try again. This is what the statement says, she has failed in her chores, so in the spring, once the hibiscus blossoms again, she will attempt to complete her chore. The statement also concludes how you should never give up. Saeng had failed the test. She said, " I failed the test ." It shows how sad and depressed she was, as the tone the statement was made was a sadder and more depressed tone. Even though sad and depressed, Saeng knows that next year she will attempt to complete the test. Overall, the sentence shows what the author concludes and thinks about the "Winter Hibiscus" story.            

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph "When they return Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and the hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again", for several reasons. , @ CAPS1, Saeng decides that she is determined to pass her driver's license just like the hibiscus. Saeng's mother says he's " strong enough to get by, " and Saeng decides to be strong like hibiscus and take the test. Then the reason the geese are mentioned in the last paragraph is because she gets used to @ LOCATION1 because the geese "look familiar". As much as she misses her old house, she adapts. Finally, we can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, she misses her old house as much as she begins to get used to her new country and she recognizes that 'she is one of them. She knows that letting her past get in the way won't help her pass the test and, like the plant and the geese, she will come back.       

<START>

 

The author has concluded this paragraph in this story because I think he is trying to convey a message to the reader. The author is trying to say that if a plant can get through the cold winter, then it can pass its driving test. That's why I think the author included this paragraph.  

<START>

 

I think the author ended the story like this because she loves seeing geese and loves spring and wants to take the test and pass. Sh is studying for it in the meantime. 

<START>

 

The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author thinks that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique to it. his subject. And as also gives her a memory of where she lived before moving to the @ ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had looked out of place, she didn't know what to do.  

<START>

 

The author is very creative. He concludes the story by telling how the hibiscus is built and that it will pass the test again. She thinks she will do better when the snow is gone. The author ended the story with this because Saeng was very upset that she failed a test, but with the comfort of the hibiscus, she will be able to do better. He also concludes the story with this paragraph because the climax was when she failed her test and somehow the author had to conclude what was going to happen to Saeng with the test.      

<START>

 

He concludes the story like this because the test was the main thing he was talking about.

At the end of Minfong Ho's "Winter Hibiscus", the narrator describes her desire to pass and this time passing the driving test she failed earlier today, she "silently swore to herself" that she would succeed at something she had failed at in the past. This is an important concluding message, because it shows that the author will overcome obstacles in his future. Most of the story is about the sadness the narrator experiences because of longing for her homeland, Saeng misses her grandmother and the plants of Vietnam, and she even buys a hibiscus plant to remind him of her homeland. . She is also not taking advantage of @ LOCATION2, as she has already experienced failure in her new home. However, the end of the story offers a contrast, as Saeng promises to be successful in the future.          

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph they wrote because it shows how much the main character has grown. She learned that while a delicate flower like hibiscus can go through tough times, so can it. nature's struggle for survival is like Saeng's struggle in a new place. She finds out that you will adapt to your surroundings over time. After this period, you will feel right at home. The principle of adaptation is shown throughout this story demonstrating by the nature or the life of a child that it is there. Therefore, the author will agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates Saeng's biological and physical growth.      

<START>

 

In the “Winter Hibiscus” story, Saeng is new to @ LOCATION1. She misses home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After bringing the flower home and planting it in her garden, she decides that the next time she takes the driving test is when the hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it connects Saeng with the flower. Saeng doesn't feel out of place in @ LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a link to his old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can get through the cold winter, so can it. She will pass her driving test as a sign of survival and overcoming obstacles. In this story, the general theme is that everything will improve over time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @ LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass his driving test.        

<START>

 

They ended it because the girl is not going to give up. She will keep trying this test and won't stop at it either. And it will be a little brighter. She will also pass this test. And that way, she won't disappoint her mother. And she will be able to get this test from her carriers.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to redo the test and have the new fresh flowers to look at. To see the geese come back. The geese are symbolic for her and the quest she had undertaken ... in her new home. The combination of melting snow and budding flowers lets the reader know the bright and unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end to further explain what's to come, improve artwork, and engage the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. it allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is struggling to take root / grasp in the new lifestyle but there will always be a new / new time to keep going.       

<START>

 

I think the author put this paragraph in the story because maybe it's because it's a good thing or it's a tradition, so it's very important that it's in the story. It could also be trying to tell us something like she only does the test in the spring when the hibiscus starts to bud. 

<START>

 

In the short story "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this special paragraph in order to mutulate Saeng's game to want to be at home but also to show that she is learning to overcome obstacles. Saeng wants her to return to her homeland and continues to refer to it because she wants it back. “I mean, it's not like the one we had to-to-,” Saeng continues to stumble because she doesn't want to mention the house because it made her cry. Also, if she mentions the "test", it makes her buy a fake test. "It's - it's not a real one." She refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driver's license and how sad she is already. The test relates to both the factory test and the driver test. Saeng also ends with this wish because the flower represents hope to her, "... and this hibiscus is budding, I will pass this test". Testing the emotions of the two situations she finds herself in will allow her to be stronger. the vow at the end of the story shows that she is ready to be strong and be successful in the end.      

<START>

 

In the story, the author concludes that after taking her test and there is nothing to see, she will grow taller.

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph she made because the girl did not pass the driving test. And she adds all the details of nature to it because she takes the time to care about nature. This is what it is mainly about in the story.  

<START>

 

I guess the author adds this paragraph to tell the reader that when all the beauty returns, she will try to get used to new things again.

<START>

 

The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with this paragraph because it gives the impression of starting over and making a fresh start for Saeng. The hibiscus is a reminder of her homeland and it keeps her strong and she compares herself to geese by saying that things she thought were strange have become familiar through silent repetition from season to season. In winter, the hibiscus does not bloom, and Saeng fails his driving test. This paragraph says that in the spring, when the hibiscus thrives and the geese return, it will be a new beginning for them and for Saeng as well.     

<START>

 

The author likely ends the story with Saeng promising to take the test again, as he wants to show Saeng's resolve. For example, when she told her mother that she had failed the test, her mother knew it was difficult for Saeng. Since it was a moment of silence, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant was not a good idea. Saeng somehow compares himself to the plant. she @ MONTH1 thought, if this plant can overwinter and keep growing, then it can pass the test. Therefore, this is probably why the author ended the story the way he did.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has new hope and new determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for example "But it's strong enough to get through the winter," says her mother. Saeng wants to be able to face hardships as hard as the hibiscus can. She is filled with a new resolve when she says to herself, "Then I'll take the test again."              

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story led to it and the story would have been pointless if it wasn't for the conclusion.  

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will adapt to the conditions of his new life. Hibiscus is a plant that thrives in hot, tropical climates. However, it does not survive the cold; only winter hibiscus, which can survive in both climates (hot and cold) can. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. She lived in Vietnam and loved it with all the pretty flowers and being with her grandmother. However, now that she lives in the United States, she is struggling to adjust. Now that she has this hibiscus flower, which adapts beautifully to the cold, she can adjust to her new life in the United States. When she sees the geese come back for another spring and summer, she will take the driving test because they give her area another chance to be their home for the season. This is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.         

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph deals with the melting of the snow and the return of the greenery, like a rebirth. It sounds like his renewed motivation to retake the test. It really shows how close he is to nature and the effect his exposure to it has had on him over the years.  

<START>

 

I think the author ended the story with this paragraph because the whole story was sweet and left a nice picture in your head with like pretty much every sentence. So why not end it with a paragraph like " When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again ". Say now that it was not pretty.    

<START>

 

Then the author put the last sentence as he did. That doesn't mean that next spring they want to see how they react differently. They know what it is, but they know how to react to the season.

He uses this line at the end of the story because it shows that she has another chance to pass the test. They use the plant because a plant will always come back and bud again. It was also a good way to end the story as it now shows in the plants present that @ MONTH1 is a sign of inspiration and would teach you to admire something. And perhaps this is how she communicates with her mother through plants.   

<START>

 

In the story of Winter Hibiscus, they end the story with this paragaph, because he regrets that she is getting used to the new contrury. She also tells you that you need to keep abreast of the winds. That's why I think they finished with this paragraph

The flowers on this bush are very heartwarming for Saeng. In the story, she explains that they remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of the plant and the spring represent new life. Saeng thinks spring might have a new start for her too. That in the spring, she will do better and pass the test. But, if she falls, the flowers will have bloomed to comfort her.     

<START>

 

The author concludes with this because it somehow relates to flowers. She grew up in her environment like a flower. Also, she had failed her test, so just like when a flower dies and then comes back, she will come back and try the test again.  

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed the test so during the winter they don't get hibiscus, but in the spring when they get the hibiscus she will try to regain the taste so that she can succeed.

<START>

 

The author concludes this as the last paragraph for two main reasons. One of them is that the flower is almost like it in being, the flower has not bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms, she is like the flower and will try to bloom again by passing the test Another reason is because it reminds her of the bock house and her mother understands why she paid it so much want to take the heart.

Minfong Ho, author of " Winter Hibiscus" concluded the story with Saeng by promising herself that she will retake and pass her driving test in the spring when the geese come back and plant re-buds. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to signify Saeng's willingness to start over. After failing a test, Saeng visits a greenhouse and misses his old home, Vietnam. She buys a hibiscus and plants it when she comes home after noticing the geese flying south for the winter. The plant signifies its memories. When she first sees him, he has blossomed. In the spring, it will re-bud and form another flower as it grows larger. This parallels Saeng overcoming his sadness and homesickness and rebuilding better memories while growing stronger. When she has the chance. The birds that fly above our heads head south for the winter for shelter from the cold. In the spring, they will come back to start raising goslings again, to rebuild their house, to start again since last spring. Saeng plans to start over and be successful so that she can drive and feel more accepted at @ LOCATION2. Minfong Ho, chose to end the story with a paragraph to signify that the character is starting over and rebuilding good memories.                                                 

<START>

 

The last paragraph of " Winter Hibiscus " was added because the author wants to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test. She feels disappointed because her mother is disappointed with her and knows she can do without. As she gazes at the Hibiscus and then the geese flying in the air, she thinks she has a chance to pass the test. Now that she is determined to take the test, she is going to take it at the same time next year and she thinks she is going to pass it.

The author concluded "when they come back Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will do this test again" to tell the reader never to give up and to keep trying. It also tells us that the family is still there because you can't do it on your own. "It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi", she said finally  

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author tries to show the reader that she has realized that she cares about nature and therefore loves it because she waits for spring and soon that spring will come, she will retake the test. So, in my opinion, the author wants to show the readers that the character in the story cares a lot about nature. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the line saying "when they come back saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again" because the hibiscus isn't like a lucky charm, when it's not there things don't go well, but when it does come back things get better. The author also concludes this because the hibiscus lucky charm gave more confidence and when we say it really confident we will succeed. The last story is for the reader to know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so good.  

<START>

 

The author thus concludes the story because one of the themes is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng's perseverance, and the last paragraph offers a closure to the conflict that has been introduced. The hibiscus is "strong enough to get through the cold months here ... that's what counts", it links the plant to the author's persistence due to the symbolism. The last paragraph adds this symbolism with the closure as it says she will wait until spring to retake the test.     

<START>

 

Saeng tries to say that when the time comes, she will pass the test. The author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering what will happen the next time she takes the test. The author also does this to show that you should never give up, because if the flower can survive the winter, it will be able to survive this test. The author also says that when the seasons change, things change. She was going to give up because she had failed the test, but she saw this plant survive the elements and it gave her more confidence. Plus, she treasured the plant because she wanted to see it bud because she and her mom spent some quality time dipping into this plant she had.

Saeng talks about his schoolwork and the garden. It always connects the two in the same way. she knows she has to study while the garden is growing and she wants to water the flowers and she says when the spring comes she will not be there for the garden and she will have to take the test.    

<START>

 

The author ended the story this way to show that Saeng won't give up and is determined to get the job done. The author wants the reader to understand Saeng's sadness and wants to overcome the homesickness. Saeng is very similar to hibiscus, she is frail and beautiful. Saeng says she'll do her test again when the hibiscus buds, almost as if growing with the plant.   

<START>

 

The author closed the story with the paragraph because it shows that anything and everyone can go through a rough time. This paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers. The text says: "when they come back ... I will take this test again". This quote shows that Saeng can think of himself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She knows that her “winter” is her test and that when she is ready, she can take the test again and pass. The budding of the hibiscus represents when it will be ready to take the test. Although she is having a hard time now, she will be able to pull through and make another attempt. This paragraph is at the end because it brings together the purpose of the hibiscus. Without saying it, readers would never have understood this message, instead they would believe that the role of the hibiscus was to serve as a link to Saeng's past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph has been included to show readers that anyone can recover from a bad situation.         

<START>

 

This could mean that she can only take the test in the spring. But also because her surroundings during this period relaxed her. When she was disappointed and @ CAPS1 about her failed driving.  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this @ CAPS1 because she really cared about the hibiscus. She said this because she was comparing her test to hibiscus. When the hibiscus buds, it will retest. The hibiscus is far from her. this is his chance. And with the budding hibiscus, she can make her new life. without the hibiscus plant, it was a laser. She was so depressed that her test failed that is why she bought hibiscus to influence her life. she has decided when it will sprout with the budding hibiscus, she will start her new life by repeating the test and explaining to herself how important the hibiscus is        

<START>

 

The author concludes that anything can happen in history. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus and her mother got mad at her. Saeng's mother was angry that she was spending money on the whole plant instead of planting it and it would be much cheaper then. When his mother was angry and incredulous, Saeng started to cry and the mother forgave him for his actions. It shows that anything can happen    

<START>

 

The author most likely concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to show the reader that even if you fail at something, you cannot be stubborn. So Saeng failed his driving test, but in the spring when the hibiscus plant begins to bud, it will come back and retake the test. By the budding plant she thinks of this as a sign that she will pass the test  

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with Saeng silently saying a wish to herself to show the reader that she will grow like the hibiscus plant and take the test again, this time determined to pass it. The plant gives Saeng hope as it reminds him of the homeland she loved so much. When the hibiscus begins to bud and obtain beautiful flowers, Saeng will also “bud” and obtain his license.  

<START>

 

I think the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. he says "in the spring, when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the geese come back to the hunting season and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again". so @ CAPS1 starts in the spring, so it must be the sun in the spring.   

<START>

 

 The author used the paragraph explaining how saeng would be tested in the spring at the end of the story, as the words used and the way it is read can tell the reader that saeng is at peace and accepts the fact that she is alive. in the United States When Saeng says " and this hibiscus plant is budding, " she thinks of how the plant reminds her of her homeland. Moreover, when she said : " Then I'll come back this test ," she promises that she will pass the test when she feels at home in her new country. Saeng also kind of thinks to herself that she should come to terms with the fact that she has moved and that she can still be reminded of her homeland with the new hibiscus plant and many other things.       

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph for very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She might want people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start again, just like Saeng. Ending the story with this paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and the geese will start their lives again. Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but will retake the test instead. The author might consider writing a sequel to this short story. This leaves you thinking that the sequel will be about the start of Saeng's new life and what she plans to do to fulfill her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring, Saeng will too. Author @ MONTH1 likes people to wonder what's next. People will go home and wonder what the author will do next with Saeng. The author likes to hold people on their toes and wait for a response.           

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's willingness to overcome obstacles and adjust to his new life. The hibiscus in the final quote describes Saeng's new hope and determination to succeed in America. For example, in the text it says “… its thin petals parted to reveal a long, yellow pollen-tipped stamen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost visceral.” When Saeng said, found a plant that seemed both her past in Vietnam and her future at @ LOCATION3, she was bowled over. The hibiscus represents new hope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has bloomed, its world will be opened and a new life will wait to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually be successful. a hint of velvet towards the center just as she had imagined. Saeng's past memories could be reached when this hibiscus was new and it was a huge inspiration to him. The author ended the story with the new memory of Saeng and hopes to prove that she did indeed find something useful and stable in a new world.    

<START>

 

The author concluded the story, "Winter Hibiscus," with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to describe to her reader that even though Saeng was having difficulty leaving her old home, she could still find a good life with a fresh start here. In the last paragraph, winter shows represent difficult times in the past, while spring represents a more optimistic future and a new beginning. Even though Saeng was mourning the end of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story, she once knew the cran hibiscus she was making at home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and a reminder of her old home. Also, the story says. Almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of things she had previously considered strange had become, through season-to-season repetition, almost familiar to her now. This quote leads to the last paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can enjoy living happily in this new home. The last paragraph says: “ . . When the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I'll take this test again. " When things that are familiar and things that remind him of his former home return, Saeng will have the strength to try again to do good things for this new life in a new home.            

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this statement because it shows that you can always start clean, you should never give up when you really want something. The daniter really wanted to take the test so she worked hard but failed. She knows that plant spring will offer a new brain in life, and that there is always something you can change about yourself that you don't like about yourself. I totally agree with this statement because if you didn't get a second chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes in there and everyone is having too much trouble. to repair them. This is why I believe the author concludes this statement from the end of the story.    

<START>

 

The story and this paragraph because Saeng thinks that next spring, when her new hibiscus is born, she will be lucky to pass her driving test. This is a good way to end the story as the hibiscus was not involved in her life until she took the driving test. Now, she believes that during her next driving test, she will have the connection to her past experiences, her ability to overcome obstacles and her comfort in a time of disappointment. Which Saeng says may help him pass the test.   

<START>

 

The author could have had many reasons to end the story with this paragraph. One of the reasons @ MONTH1 is to explain how it has changed in history. Towards the beginning of the story, the author seems disheartened and upset that he failed his test. In her last paragraph, it shows that she has overcome her fear. In addition, the geese move like her. “ Saeng and his family moved to the United States, but the geese also feel weird, but they come back every year. With the flower, Saeng is unique in his new life and must learn to adapt like geese and flowers do. She knows the flower will bud and the geese will come back in the spring and that's what she has to do. She won't give up but will try again later in the year. It shows how she adapts and changes to work with her new surroundings.

In “Winter Hibiscus,” the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng's determination not only to pass his driver's license, but to adjust to his new home. The author says "promised" to express a positive connotation in the paragraph.

<START>

 

The author ended the story with the paragraph because all the ideas are there and to show that Saeng is ready for what lies ahead. When they put the flower on, they conclude about the importance of the flowers and their relation to how the girl feels happy or sad. Yet when she says she's sworn ... and takes the test again, she says she's ready for what lies ahead, but will be open to new things so she can see more. 'where she left. Therefore, the author ends with this paragraph to leave the mystery of what happened and to conclude.

The end of a story helps determine the meaning of the story. This is the final closing and the reader will most likely remember it. At the end of the Winter Hibiscus story, the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement. The conclusion encourages you to keep trying, as it indicates that next year, when the flower blooms, Saeng will retest. It shows encouragement as he has the will to try again and be successful. The author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is strong and seems to recap the meaning of the story as well, as Saeng continues to be disappointed with the flower, her mother and homeland encourage her to go ahead and try again. The ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was really trying to convey

In Minfong Ho's story "Winter Hibiscus", the main character is confused as they have left home and the culture, customs and even the food are different. Therefore, the main character finds it difficult to adapt to his new surroundings. The author concludes the final statement to show that she will not stop trying to achieve her goal. She wants to repeat the test to see if over time things @ MONTH1 have changed. The story is very moving and expresses a great sadness which is finally overcome.

The author concludes the paragraph when Saeng realizes that she may miss her old home, but has to adjust to the new place she is in. eyes swept over her now. But, she begins to realize that not everything has changed, the same things are still familiar. "Above us, a herd of Canada geese have passed, low honors are clearing up and -yes- familiar to Saeng now." When Saeng realizes that all has not changed, she finds the strength to continue her new life in her new country.   

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it was a good way to end the story. At the end of that, they were talking about how saeng would come back when the snow melted, and then she would take the test again. 

<START>

 

When they return, Saeng dedicates himself silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding; then I will take this test again. The author concludes this Winter Hibiscus story with this paragraph because in the story it is about Saeng and she fails her driving test, and notices a familiar plant that leads her to go to a florist. As Saeng discovers this familiar plant, it encourages him to take that test drive again, where the snow was gone and the sun was shining.

<START>



I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say that in the spring when the snow clears and the hibiscus begins to grow, she will test the plant again

<START>



The author thus concludes the story to show that Saeng still has the hope of succeeding and adapting in this new country. She previously had a hard time at home, missed her grandmother and memories of her childhood. The height of her homesickness is seen when Saeng returns home and explains to her mother the nature of hibiscus. "She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again." Saeng is uncomfortable living at @ LOCATION1 and wishes to return to Vietnam. But in the end, Saeng's attitude turns from hopelessness to hope. Even though she failed her driving test. Saeng is determined and hopes to at least do something in this new country by saying "" ... then I will take the test again. " Saeng has changed a lot in this story and this change in attitude can be seen with the excerpt about the geese in the last paragraph. "          

<START>

 

I think he put that here because. I think he's trying to tell when the snow melts, forget the first time. And when the geese return it, your luck @ NUM1. Then the budding hibiscus is you got past what you were trying to do.   

<START>

 

This author concludes the story with this paragraph, because they were both talking about the cold or the weather and @ CAPS1 so he was full of the snowmelt while he was talking about the weather or @ CAPS1.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story like this because it shows how the main character was affected by the events or events of the story. At the beginning of the story, we learn that the main character has failed his driving test. Also in the story, she had spent a large amount of money on a single plant, which shocked her mother. The reader at this point would expect her to be very sad and depressed. But because of her grandmother and her homeland, she rather surprises the reader by looking on the bright side and saying that when the flower blooms again, she will retest the test. It shows the connection between the main character and the plant. Give the plant a human existence.      

<START>

 

I believe the author chose to end the story with this paragraph to illustrate the overall message of the story. This paragraph summarizes the message of determining and overcoming obstacles. Saeng comes from another country and faces challenges not only in the garden, but also in his life. She had to learn to adapt to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, saying "in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again", she really shows her determination and how unafraid she is to overcome the obstacles that she will be confronted.    

<START>

 

The author of this story concludes this story this way because instead, she absorbs all the pain in which she can look to the future. So, looking to the future, she can forget about the past and try better in the future. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this coin because she said "a flock of Canada geese flew, their weak horns clear", I think she means that even though the geese flew over with their heads held high. , even if Saeng's was not. "Next year, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I will take this test again." She means that she will not have her head down and that she will be thankful for her new home and with time. She looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but will not be sad.   

<START>

 

There are two reasons he concluded the story with this paragraph. The only reason the author had concluded the story with the paragraph was because Saeng had silently picked up a Winter Hibiscus so that she might have to take that driving test. Finally; the last reason the author ended the story with this paragraph is because she wants to retry her driving test so that she can pass so that she can also drive when she gets off passing it. These two reasons were so confusing to understand what the author concludes in the story with this sentence.    

<START>

 

I think that's why the author concludes this paragraph from the story because he wanted to show the lonely Saeng had for geese.

<START>

 

There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, "Winter Hibiscus", the way she did. "Her flowers aren't quite as pretty, but they're strong enough to get through the cold months here ..." Saeng's mother said of the flowers Saeng bought out of the blue. The end almost repeats that line. When Saeng makes this wish, she fully tells herself that she too is strong enough to get through the winter and beyond. Also in the story, the author states "... she realized that a lot of things she considered strange had become ... almost familiar to her now." Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, as she will eventually adjust to her new home and cry. When Saeng vows to retake her test in the spring, it is evident that subconsciously she is saying that she can overcome these difficulties. All she needs is time.        

<START>

 

In the Winter Hibiscus story, when Saeng says she will take the test again in the spring, so she can go home and see the flower she found. Also in the story it is mentioned that in her past childhood she saw the same flower in her country, but the next time she takes the driving test she would like to pass. This shows that she was disappointed because in the story it is said that she paid over nineteen dollars for the test. His mother was amazed and yelled at him for a second. Saeng started to cry and his mother calmed down to show him sympathy. Now she has the determination to take the test again.     

<START>

 

Minfong Ho, author of the story "Winter Hibiscus" ended her story with @ ORGANIZATION1 thinking about spring because she wanted to make @ ORGANIZATION1's future brighter. The character @ ORGANIZATION1 seemed depressed and still recalled his past in Vietnam. When she sees the hibiscus and jasmine flowers, she "breaks down and cries", and she remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells of jasmine. To make matters worse for Saeng, she failed her driving test, which most teens see as a big disappointment. At this point in the story, I was feeling sorry for @ ORGANIZATION1 and wondering if things would get better for her because she was a long way from everything she knew and loved with just a few memories and a hibiscus d winter different from the one it had to its name in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, @ ORGANIZATION1 suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and "when the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding".        

<START>

 

The concluding paragraph of the story "Winter Hibiscus" gives a sense of hope for the future. The daughter, Saeng, has just failed her exam and is feeling depressed. Through a series of events, her depression leaves her and she feels hope. " Then I'll take this test again." " This last sentence shows the determination Saeng. She was upset to leave her house and she was upset that she had failed her exam, but thanks to a flower she regained her confidence. Whenever someone is upset, it's easy to give up. Until the last paragraph, the tone of the story is depressing. When the author concluded, it was like a light at the end of a dark tunnel. The author says that even when things are difficult and seem impossible, something will cheer you up. There is always a positive in a negative situation, you just have to look for it.           

<START>

 

Assuming that means during winter or spring or whatever it is harder to grow this garden. It is also a challenge to grow the garden at this time of year. So I guess that's what he's talking about.  

<START>

 

The author includes this sentence from the end of the story because throughout the story she has shown courage, and this explains why she improves and shows courage that she will go back and try to pass this test and don't drop it that she failed the first time.        

<START>

 

For me, I should say that the reason the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be for different reasons. Explaining it could mean a new start or a new beginning. For example, when geese fly away and come back, it means the @ CAPS1 are changing. That being said, changing or restarting @ CAPS1 might represent his chance to pass the test can start over, and he will have another chance.    

<START>

 

I think they think it will bring them luck

<START>

 

The author closed the story with this paragraph because it shows that you can overcome something if you have the will. Saeng failed the first test. She bought a plant that reminds her of her home. She planted the plant despite the cold, hard soil. She realized that once strange things were now part of her daily life. She decided to take the test again. Saeng realized that even if @ MONTH1 fails once, you have to keep trying if that's what you believe in. She also realized that she will never forget her home but that she can always move on. Eventually, Saeng realized that good things can turn bad in the end. After failing the test, she bought the flower. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it sums up the story perfectly.         

<START>

 

The author includes the exception at the end for a reason that makes sense to Saeng. the hibiscus symbolizes everything, its home, its past and its comfort. Saeng thinks that if the flower can bloom, so can she. This will allow him to get used to his new home and take the test again. It also sounds like hope, because if the plant can get through winter and flower in spring, so can it. The author used this to relate Saeng's feelings to the realisms of blooming flowers.

The author concludes this statement because the geese move south in the winter and return in the spring, Saeng failed the test in the winter but she will take it again in the spring season. As Saeng fails her driving test and sees the familiar plant, she will return to take the test. The geese are gone but will return when the season arrives. So the geese and Saeng both have a reason to come north or retake the test. The author adds the statement at the end because the geese 'actions are like Saeng's.    

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how Saeng was not going to give up. Throughout the story, she had felt depressed. Since when she failed the test and missed Vietnam. So many things everywhere she lives with her mother reminds her of Vietnam. “She closed her eyes and breathed. inside, deep, Saeng could almost feel the light strands of his grandmother's long gray hair… ”It made her very moved, to see how many things reminded her of Vietnam. The author ended this way to show how the experience of it all affected her.      

<START>

 

The author chose to end the story this way to inspire a sense of determination. Saeng obtained the plant to remind him of his homeland and to cheer him up. Once the plant has flowered it feels like it too and is ready for the test.  

<START>

 

The author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement. " When the geese come back ... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I will take this test again." " This statement shows the renewal and persistence. I think she added this because after realizing that the plant can come back again and again, even after bad weather, she knew she could do it too. She swore to herself that when the day returns, she will be ready to renew herself and get back on track. It also conveys persistence. The plant does not die every season. He's sturdy and comes back. If the girl can be persistent and come back next year to retake the test, she will be considered persistent. I think the girl wants to be like a flower. She sees him as indomitable, renewing and beautiful. No matter where the plant is grown, it will always retain these characteristics.               

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the following is because she wants readers to know that saeng won't give up just because she fails the first time around. What she is going to achieve to make her mother proud of her and to show that she is trying to make an effort. He indicates that saeng will retake the test in the spring when the snow has melted and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Not only was the hibiscus an important part of the story, it was a very important part of his life. Yes, it was a bummer for her mother, but she somehow understood why she brought the plant home. It might comfort her in a way. There were probably a lot of different things going on where she was, she failed the test, it wasn't at home. She must adapt and adapt to the situation in which she finds herself.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed the test and the next time this time of year returns, she will have another chance to pass the test. I say this because in the text it says that she paid @ MONEY1 so that all the vegetable seeds in the garden didn't even cost that much. That is why I say that she concluded with this paragraph.  

<START>

 

Next year, around winter, when she has to replant things, she'll be ready and this time she's gone to do a lot better.

<START>

 

The author included this because it showed that it was winter and the flower was going to bloom and the geese were flying here because it was cold. The author also said this because the title of the story is called "Winter Hibiscus" which obviously blooms in the winter, which is why I think the author said what she did. 

<START>

 

The author of the story "Winter Hibiscus" concludes the story with a sentence indicating that when the first bud of Saeng's Hibiscus appears in the spring, she will be back to take the driving test. Perhaps the author would have decided to conclude the story like this because if the plant died, would it go back and pass the test? The author probably wanted the reader to give this serious thought. In conclusion, the author of the story "Winter Hibiscus" might have concluded his story to make it somewhat suspenseful.   

<START>

 

The story ends with this line because @ CAPS1 gets its strength from hibiscus, so next time it won't fail the test. During the time it takes for the hibiscus to grow, it will also grow as a person and therefore be ready for the test. The story says: "Plants that she had even realized that she knew but had forgotten brought her back to the world of her childhood" (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she received love and support. By seeing all these plants again, especially the hibiscus, she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories that the hibiscus brings back are also very sad. The story says, "A wave of loss so deep and so strong that it stung Saeng's eyes has now swept her away" (Ho). Experiencing all that sadness again will only make it stronger. Besides just seeing the hibiscus, other things will prepare her for the test as well. The story says, "It was smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center - just like she expected" (Ho). The feel of the hibiscus @ MONTH1 reminds Saeng of distant memories, like helping his grandmother with her hair. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger, so the next time she takes the test she won't fail.          

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring, when the snow has disappeared, she will take the test again.

<START>

 

In the quote above, it says that saeng is happy to be back. Saeng also states that she would be ready to start over if she had to. 

<START>

 

I think the author concluded the story like this because it was cold outside. I also think the author is trying to say that when she wrote this letter it was cold outside and she would not do the test until it got hot again from the cold. “In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I will do this test again. "    

<START>

 

There are many reasons the author says, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again." @ CAPS1 the author said this because the girl left everything to come to this country and she cannot fail. Gil said, " That, well, she could hang on to it." But where did the good foot come from? the hibiscus hedge? She also said this because the hedge was all she had from her old house apart from her mother and when "the hibiscus is budding" it means that it is starting new life and starting to grow leaves and that the girl begins to grow and continue with her life.        

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is that if the author tries again, it might work a lot better now that he knows what he is doing. Also, if they try it again, if they do enough, they can sell it and earn money to keep doing it for years to come. 

<START>

 

The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concludes the story with a resolution from Saeng to show how Saeng won't give up and how determined she is. The reference to spring flowers shows how Saeng will fight to survive hardships, which are represented by winter. Much like the hibiscus struggling to adjust to a new home, Saeng struggles to adapt to a new country. The final paragraph provides a resolution to Saeng's internal conflict throughout the story by suggesting that Saeng will pass the test. In conclusion, the last paragraph of the story "Winter Hibiscus" brings a resolution to the conflict of the story and shows the determination of the reader Saeng.   

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows what Saeng will do and whether she will go to school. Saeng didn't want to go to school because she will wait until the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus rears up and prefers to garden at school. and the garden remind For its homeland. For @ CAPS1, Saeng dug a hole and carefully lowered the winter hibiscus into it. The thing that made her love her homeland was the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzling of hot oil in the pan, the pungent smell of the best melon escaping. Another @ CAPS1, she went to the corner of the vegetable garden and started digging a hole in the ground, which shows that she cares about the garden.     

<START>

 

The author concludes his story with the following quote : "When they return, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again." because the author shows that nature and plants are precious to him. Saeng (who says the quote) thinks the hibiscus will help him pass the test. Earlier in the story, it shows that when she is in trouble, she rubs the leaves of the plant in her hands to help him get over the problem. The author clarifies the idea and describes the idea that the plant helps Saeng overcome obstacles.       

<START>

 

At the end of the story, daughter Saeng swears to herself that she will pass the driving test next year. One of the reasons she @ MOIS1 has sworn to do so is to prove that she can pass the test. Also the flower after buying and planting it, and after remembering all the good times she had in Vietnam, it gave her the confidence to go out and get what she wanted. 

<START>

 

The author includes this in the paragraph just to be sarcastic for you to know that it is almost impossible for Saeng to retake the test. I say this because she was very sarcastic, which means she will not pass the test. For example, if someone tells me to take a test and I say every time @ LOCATION1 is new president, then I will take the test. That would be very sarcastic, which would mean that it won't happen and that I don't take the test, instead of just saying no. The author has included her just to let you know that the chances of her passing the test are very low.     

<START>

 

The author includes this paragraph in order to end the story and show that Saeng did not give up. Ho wanted to show how the plant and the geese represented the continuation of Saeng's life in the United States. The geese will return and the Hibiscus will bud and flower, and Saeng will come back and hopefully pass his dive test. This paragraph is not only a conclusion but a new beginning of life for geasse, a Winter Hibiscus and Saeng.        

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the strength and encouragement of @ CAPS1. When she wants to and can, she will take the test again with more confidence. Saeng told herself this to help her get through until she could drive. She says that next spring she will take her exam. Next spring she will be able to drive. Next spring she will be used to her new home. This paragraph says it takes time to do things you don't always understand right away, so keep trying.      

<START>

 

In my opinion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was feeling depressed about not having passed her driving test, but when she saw these flowers she realized that when she got to @ CAPS1, she forgot everything about her hometown. So she decided to reconnect with a natural side and delay her test until spring instead of rushing things.   

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with this particular paragraph that she still has hopes of finding a home and being happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. So when the plant buds, it will feel at home and happy again, that is when it will pass the driver's license. Plus, this paragraph shows her slowly getting used to her new home and new lifestyle : “ A herd of Canada geese flew in, their deer honking weak and - yes - familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of things she once considered strange had become, through the silent season-to-season repetition, almost familiar to her now, like those geese. Through these examples, I believe the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show Saeng's assimilation into his new lifestyle and his acceptance of his situation.       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng did not give up on the test. for example, she says “ I will take the test again. " This shows that she wants to take the test and pass it. Saeng will wait for spring and the snow to melt to take the test. At the beginning, in the box above, it is about her taking the test. Then it ends with the fact that she will take the test again.       

<START>

 

At the end of " Winter Hibiscus " the author, Minfong Ho concludes the story by saying : " When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and that hibiscus is budding, so I'll take the test again. The author ends the story in a way that reveals the hope that lies in Saeng's future. After failing her driving test, Saeng returns home with disappointment and sadness. This final paragraph, however, shows that Saeng's luck will soon change. The reader suggests that Saeng will retake his test and pass. Also, this last paragraph reflects Saeng's determined personality in overcoming many obstacles, she is @ CAPS1. This paragraph proves that she won't give up even after being forced to live in the United States instead of at home. Her success in adjusting to her new life is illustrated when, through the quote, "She realized almost reluctantly that a lot of things that she once considered strange had become ... almost familiar." Truly Saeng is a determined character.             

<START>

 

The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl who misses her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adjust to her new country by the next @ DATE1. The story and the paragraph show girls the strength to overcome. That is why the author ended the story with this paragraph.    

<START>

 

The author lets us / reader know that plans to do the same again next year when the show is all gone, when the geese come back and when ETCS is hot enough for the hibiscus flower to bud / bloom again! the author @ MONTH1 will also end the sentence to show that this is the life that the little donation has chosen and that she will follow the new gardening until next spring!        

<START>

 

Saeng concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows what she just experienced and thinks she might relive it. If she fails the driver's license again, she uses plants to overcome her problems. She @ MONTH1 passed the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and now believes that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood.   

<START>

 

She shows that she loves her grandma and that she loves what they do like gardening and stuff like that. Her mother cares about her but she really limits her .   

<START>

 

The author concluded the story in such a way as to open the reader's eyes. It shows the reader that despite what is happening @ MONTH1, how bad things look and how hopeless you feel, there is still a way to improve it. Saeng failed his exam, was in a new country, and had lost his grandmother, but was still planning to try again. like the waves on the shore, they will always try to wash away the sand on their way back. just like those waves, Saeng is ready to try again, like all of us.    

<START>

 

The author concluded the story with this paragraph because this season has ended and a new season begins.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with "when they return, saeng silently devoted himself to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again". This quote means that once the flower buds she will retake the test because saeng will have the courage & the will to do it knowing that she will pass it. The flower represents for her something that gives her motivation and determination. Everyone has something that modulates them in life to continue and saeng has their plant. The author kind of gives you a direction and an idea of where the story is going to unfold as well when the flower buds open.  

<START>

 

Saeng is not only disappointed that she failed her driving test, she is also upset and misses her home in Vietnam. On her way home, she sees a small piece of Vietnam in the United States. She buys the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different countries, cultures and almost worlds from which his life comes. When she says "when they come back" she is referring to the geese. For her, the geese symbolize her life at @ LOCATION2 and how she got used to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of his life. It is a symbol of his life and his past in Vietnam. It brings back memories and buying this plant was like having a little piece of home. When the “ hibiscus is budding ” she will try the test again. When that little piece of house gets bigger, she'll try again. When she is more stable in the @ CAPS1 culture, that she still has a solid grasp of hers, then she will be ready.              

<START>

 

I believe the author ended the story with this paragraph, because I think it shows that Saeng is not a stopper. Saeng can't wait for the Hibiscus to return. When the Hibiscus returns, she will take the test again and show her mother that she can do it.  

<START>

 

The reason why the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because when Saeng saw the geese, she knew that when spring returned, she would be ready to get different flowers. She also thinks back to when she was in her homeland, she could see when flowers were growing from the ground. Although now that she is in town, she thinks the flowers will bloom like those at home where she misses so much. Finally, she describes flowers as her friends. She also remembers the "Madagascar periwinkle" growing wild in cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically, the author says she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.      

<START>

 

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" concludes the story with this paragraph to describe a development in the character of Saeng. At the start of the story, Saeng is disheartened that she failed her driving test. However, this last paragraph describes the change undergone by Saeng. In the text, Saeng turns out to be poorly suited to the passage from Vietnam to @ LOCATION2. She finds solace in a flower native to Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (“… and this hibiscus is sprouting…”), the author describes Saeng's change in attitude and his acceptance of @ LOCATION2. Saeng now believes that, like the hibiscus that returns after the end of winter, she will be able to come back and pass the driving test. Additionally, the concluding paragraph describes Saeng's new adaptation to the creatures of @ LOCATION2. Prior to his imagination for @ LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the closing statement, Saeng's mention of the creatures shows his adaptation to @ LOCATION2 (“… when the snow melts and the geese come back…”). This shows Saeng's development and adaptation to his new environment. At first, Saeng struggled to leave his native Vietnam and embrace the @ CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph sums up the notable change Saeng is going through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the character development that Saeng undergoes.             

<START>

 

They conclude the story with this because winter is over and spring is here and it will be beautiful again

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with, “When they come back, saeng silently dedicated himself , in the springtime when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take this test again. @ CAPS1 then it will become more familiar. For example, the author says, "Almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of things she once considered strange before had become, thanks to the silent season-to-season repetition, almost familiar to her now." This tells me that she feels that at the same time she is going to familiarize herself with driving and then she will take the test again. Then she @ MONTH1 passes him       

<START>

 

 The author of "Winter Hibiscus" decided to conclude the story this way because she wanted to tie the theme of fresh starts. Saeng is new to @ LOCATION1 and struggled to fit in. He misses everything in his old house, from his grandmother to the old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels like all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the winter and flower in the spring and that's what Saeng realizes she has to do. The last paragraph said, "In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding, then I'll take this test again." Spring is the time for new beginnings: geese are coming back from the south, flowers are starting to bloom, and Saeng can retake his driver's license. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes that she also wants a new beginning brought to spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph links the theme of new beginnings to history. It shows the new achievement of @ CAPS1 and how the hibiscus inspired it.         

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng really wants to pass the test. You know this when it is written " And in the hot and humid shelter of the greenhouse, saeng collapsed and cried ". This passage shows that she did not want to fail. When Saeng got home, she had the white pimple in the pot and her mother saw that she was crying. Then her mother was going to put the plant in the ground, then saeng with a shovel and did it herself. Make her realize she can take it back       

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. First of all, when the hibiscus is budding in the spring, it means that the plant is about to flower. It also means that Saeng will be ready in the spring to take the test again. Also, the last paragraph is at the end because if the plant can do it, then the girl can pass her driving test and be happy both ways.   

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author says it's going to be a year @ CAPS1 or a change is going to happen and he thinks it could have done better than they have done and will take this test again.

<START>

 

The author concludes with this paragraph to underline the new start that saeng is looking for. She was so disappointed when she failed her driving test. & the hibiscus was what made her happy. she needed a fresh start to start over in a new land and the flower, the flower the snow, the geese and the test all symbolize new beginnings and the challenges to be overcome, the geese and the snow represent a change of season, the budding hibiscus represents new life, & passing the test is a milestone in saeng's life. By ending the story with this paragraph, the reader expects something new and exciting to happen to saeng.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph to explain to the reader that she has not finished gardening, that she will return there when she blooms again. she hasn't finished either. she would rather garden than go to school. This is what the author concludes about the story with the last paragraph.     

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with the few words " then I will take this test again ". because she wanted us to know that she won't give up on something she once failed. She will continue until she passes "the test".    

<START>

 

The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she shouldn't be afraid to try a new life or a new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, “The flowers are not pretty, but they are strong enough to get through the cold months. here this winter hibiscus. “It shows that the mother wants Saeng to learn that Saeng has to be strong even in difficult times. Another example is, when the narrator says,“ she realized that a lot of things that she considered strange before are becoming , through the silent rehearsal from season to season… "This shows that Saeng has realized that the new place she is leaving is right now is almost the same as their old home. In conclusion, the last paragraph says that Saeng has to face it. to the new reality of the world, it must be strong and follow the course of life.     

<START>

 

The author concluded this story for an internal adjustment. Saeng's memories are expressed through that of the hibiscus. Spring is a season when everything is fresh and new. As in spring, Saeng's hope would be restored and prospered, when the budding hibiscus, and the hibiscus will have the opportunity to retry the test with more strength and inspiration.   

<START>

 

The author of "Winter Hibiscus" concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, promising to take the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is in bloom. It's a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng won't give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus in bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she arrived at @ LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to come to terms with his new lifestyle and uses hibiscus as a tool to help him get through the toughest times. After Saeng buys the flower, she swears to retake the failed driving test after spring. Spring is the symbol of a new beginning. Saeng also thinks that if the hibiscus can overwinter at @ LOCATION1, Saeng can too. The conclusion of this story uses a lot of imagery that suggests Saeng will be strong and will live on at @ LOCATION1.

The author's resonance concludes the story with this paragraph because I failed the test and made your learned to appreciate nature a bitter litter.

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to flowers in the spring.

<START>

 

The author states this idea because if you can't do it once, start over. First, if you take a test and you can't pass it the first time around, start over and you can pass it. For example, in the story, Saeng couldn't pass a test, so they could have let her take it again to see if she could pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you achieve success much more easily if you study enough. That's what I think the statement means.     

<START>

 

The author concludes this story with this paragraph because that is how each year will begin and end.

<START>

 

I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, as the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is ready to retry the test. She is now more open-minded about the situation. At the beginning of the story, Saeng was upset and annoyed that she had failed her driving test. For example, "the tears on her daughter's cheeks and her swollen eyes." I failed the test, ”Saeng told his mother. Obviously, she was upset and disappointed in herself. The author did not want to end the story with a sad and unsatisfying ending. Saeng changes his attitude about the test at the end of the story. For example, "When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take the test again." I believe that this attitude was due to the memories of his motherland which soothe him and also of his mother. In conclusion, the author ended the story with this to teach the reader a lesson in letting change happen and time to heal.

The author of the story " Winter Hibiscus " concludes the story with the motivational paragraph because he / she wants to show the reeder that Saeng is determined to adjust to his new life and his new home and overcome common obstacles such as a driving test. Saeng had to deal with her problem once, so she bought a hibiscus because it reminded her of home. I think the line "and the geese are coming back and this hibiscus is budding, so I'll take the test again." of the last paragraph is a symbol to grow and overcome obstacles. The conclusion of the story is a beautiful ending.              

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because when the snow melts and the geese come back, she will have more confidence to take and pass the test. After failing the test later in the story, the geese had flown away. So when the geese come back, the geese will remind him of what just happened. When the snow melts and spring arrives, the hibiscus flower will bloom again.

In the story "Winter Hibiscus" in the spring come new hopes, as she said in the story "in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I will take this test again . " She hears that the return of the hibiscus brings new hope in life to pass this test. Here, the hibiscus signifies hope. Second, when she said " the geese are coming back and this hibiscus is sprouting ", she means that it is comfort for her stronger than hope and even more so if her mum helps her blue in her car. because it is not easy to do it without the comfort of your mother. Finally, she said : “ The Canada geese walked past, their weak horns dear and yes familiar to saeng now. " Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things she previously thought became, through the silent repetition from season to season, almost familiar to her now. She means that as the season arrives and the hibiscus grows, she will regain the blive and strength she needs to pass the test .

Back from having failed her driver's license, Saeng is comforted by the discovery of the hibiscus flower. This brings back @ CAPS1 darling about Saeng's homeland as he looks a lot like the flowers that grew near his old home. The author concluded the story by saying "When they come back Saeng silently swore to himself, when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I will take this test again", to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to a new environment. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this link and draws inspiration from it. In Saeng's mind, if the hibiscus can survive the displacement, so can she.     

<START>

 

The story of “ Winter Hibiscus ” is an extended metaphor of connections to a heartwarming past as well as expectations and the future. Saeng misses her homeland, but she must learn to adapt to her situation and pass her driving test. The story ends well with Saeng's promise that in the spring she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise because it gives it some closure and alleinizes some homesickness. Saeng's promise indicates that she accepts his situation. When she sees Canada geese flying, she has a kind of revelation about the seasons. "Almost reluctantly, she realized that a lot of things she had previously considered strange had become… - Almost familiar to her now." I think it was a benchmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that it makes a difference.         

<START>

 

In Minfong Ho's "Winter Hibiscus", Saeng has a deep emotional connection to the memories and flashbacks the Hibiscus brings back to him. At one point in the story, she mourns for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back conscious memories. Later in the story, she brings the plant to her mother. At first @ PERSON1 is upset, but then she understands her daughter's actions and feelings. Saeng is upset that she did not pass her test and her mother understands that. I think the author ends the story this way because she wants the reader to understand that because the hibiscus are so important to Saeng and remind her of her past, she will have a reason and a motivation to keep going and achieve her goal of to pass.     

<START>

 

As winter approaches, the geese head south. The plants lose their leaves there. Saeng says she will take the test again. It seems that the return of the geese and the hibiscus buds will give him hope and confidence. Especially the hibiscus because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother, when she first saw it and held the leaf, it brought tears to her eyes. And when he comes back next year, he will rejuvenate her.     

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks it will explain very well what happened to saeng.

<START>

 

The author concludes his story with this last paragraph because it shows the relationship between saeng and habiscas, and how just seeing it feels. It also shows that habiscus motivates her because it reminds her of her native land that she loves so much and it's like having a physical memory of her native land.   

<START>

 

The author says that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready, it will begin to bud and grow. When she is ready, she will take the test, that's what it says. She explains that she needs time, just like the geese and the flowers. So you can compare saeng to geese and hibiscus, because they too need time to be ready to do what they are doing. In a way, saeng was one with the two objects.    

<START>

 

I think the author ends this with the concluding sentence because it symbolizes how the girl defines things. Girl means when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding it means it will get hot again, @ CAPS1 means when it gets hot again it cheers him up because it reminds him of his homeland . I think that by reminding her of her homeland, she would help her pass the test more easily because she will be happier. @ CAPS1 I think this will help him to pass the test better. For example, the author said in the story that the flower gives him comfort @ CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to pass and pass the test. In conclusion, I think the author ends the story like this because he wanted readers to understand a connection to the girl and her homeland, and how the flower comforts her.     

<START>

 

the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it looks like an interesting ending paragraph that has something to do with the story

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story with this saying because it shows that she is adjusting to the new place. He @ CAPS1 shows that she is not going to give up. Just like the geese never give up the winter and spring trips.  

<START>

 

In the short story "Winter Hibiscus", Saeng decides to retake the failed driving test in the spring. She does this because she is comforted by the moderate spring weather. It reminds him of his home, and Saeng is very attached to it. It reminds me of all the places I've been and how I still remember my favorite. Like Saeng, I buy items that remind me of my old home. Saeng's commitment to his old home makes me feel less different when I miss my old home.    

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is going to start over and do better the second time around because she doesn't want to be disappointed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. 

<START>

 

I think the author concludes the story like this because it shows a fresh start. When spring arrives, everything comes back to life. Plants grow back, animals are seen again and the sun shines brightly. It's a new start for them so we can see the same for her. She might try again because it gives her another chance. Another reason he ended the story this way is that Saeng loves nature. Maybe when nature returns around her, it will give her hope and confidence to pass her test.      

<START>

 

The last paragraph of the story read, " When they come back, Saeng silently swore to himself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus buds, then I'll take that test again." " I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph to show it adapts and begins to accept change. I think because throughout the story she's upset and doesn't really like change. "And in the hot and humid shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng collapsed and cried." The text says. This last paragraph seems optimistic when talking about the blossoming of the flowers and the return of the geese who seem to be starting to embrace the change. In my opinion, the author added this paragraph to end the story and show that Saeng is starting to embrace change and be optimistic.           

<START>

 

Saeng told her mother that she had failed the test. She she what to make up for. By helping in the graden. Her mother came in and started to cook dinner.   

<START>

 

The author concludes that when the geese return she will take the test because she thinks she will be more ready for the test than it will be easier in the spring. It will give her more time to learn and study and I hope her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to finish the driving test in the spring. She feels bad as if she let her mom down for failing, "I just looked at the hibiscus," that said she was ashamed to even look at her mom. So next spring, she wants to make her mom happy and move on because she will be ready.    

<START>

 

The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow melts and all the geese have returned, the flowers @ CAPS1. This flower on which she had to do tests @ CAPS2. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; tell people to never give up. She tells people to never give up through this method because she realizes that in the end she will be prepared. In the story, the line "... slowly fades into the distance." It could mean that she realizes what's going on ; happens and never stop doing or going towards a goal you want. Another reason @ MONTH1 used it is that even though you are downstairs you have friends and family to pick you up. The line "… Through silent repetition from season to season.". It basically said that she just needed to get into the routine and that she would be able to do it.         

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between the flowers and the test. To end this show she will try season after season just as the geese come back every year. Since she's trying to do a ??? Shows that she hasn't given up, she will keep trying year after year. Plus, it says this girl is determined and won't stop trying until she succeeds. Then that last paragraph can tell you the whole story. Finally, I think that gives an idea of the whole story.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph so that the reader will have something to think about. When the author concludes with something like this, he wants the reader to make his own ending or pridicshon. And sometimes that means a sequel. 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes the story a happy ending as she doesn't give up and retakes the test. Plus, she doesn't want to disappoint her mother, she wants to make her happy and give the test a second chance. 

<START>

 

She ends it with this statement to show that she is ready to relive spring in the new country now that she is comforted by the hibiscus. The test is adjusting to the new country and she failed, she believes because she had to be comforted by her native plants, but she thinks she will pass the test next year because each repeat of the season allows her to adapt more to the new culture. When she says " when the snow melts and the geese come back and this hibiscus is budding, I'll take that test again ." All of these things tell him it's a new year and it's easier to come to terms with what's going on.              

<START>

 

She has realized that things come and go but change too. This content of times of the year, the world around her has changed. She had no control over it. She also had to face life in a new country. Living in a new country was difficult for Saeng. She had to eat new foods, hear new sounds, and see things she had never seen before. The failure of her driving test was difficult for her. Not knowing the launge and what was going on around her was hard for her. the world around her was not something she was us for. She knew she had to change and work harder to get what she wanted.         

<START>

 

The author ended the story with this paragraph to let readers know that she hasn't given up. In the story, it seems that she thought about giving up, but her thoughts about her homeland comforted her when she thought she was going to give up. But the last paragraph of the story, she confirmed that she was not giving up.  

<START>

 

I think the author concludes this story like this because they were beautiful `@ CAPS1 gave her good luck because the time @ NUM1 she didn't know they were theirs

<START>

 

To me that sounds like the one saying it has to go through a lot and they felt like they were tested or something or maybe someone left her that she really loved because she 'it says' when they get back' then @ CAPS1 thinking someone @ MONTH1 is gone or something. " And the reason I said that person @ MONTH1 feels like he's being tested is because she says "I'll take the test again." 

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomfortable. For example when it broke down at the florist. It shows that while things may remind him of home, it is not the same. You have to get used to and get used to a new place. It also shows that she believes that with more time to get used to her new home, she will be able to pass the test.    

<START>

 

The author uses this conclusion for a reason. The reason the author uses these concluding hooks is to keep the reader interested and wanting more. Saying " I will take this test again " the author asks the reader if Saeng will pass the test next time and the reader will wonder what " the test " is.      

<START>

 

The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesn't want the snow to melt so the geese don't come back. I also think he wants to let the reader know what Saeng was thinking. 

<START>

 

There was a specific reason the author concluded the story with this quote. The author wanted to show how the plant gave Saeng a new sense of determination. Saeng was previously upset and tore the plant apart. But it seemed like she realized how capable the plant was of budding and surviving. So now she was determined to fight all obstacles and retake the test she had failed.

In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, @ PERSON3's life, the vibe that held everything was great and showed how his parents had given him love throughout his life. Both of her parents were born and raised in Cuba, and in 1956 they both moved to the United States. Start their life over and take any job they can find. Then in 1961, @ PERSON2, @ CAPS1. was born.

Plus, by sharing his unrelated family and remembering how his parents' lives changed when they moved to @ LOCATION2, he showed the respect he had for them.              

<START>

 

Throughout the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, manages to maintain a single general atmosphere. In many parts of the story he recounts how much he loved his childhood, which made me think it was nostalgia, but nowhere does that point out that he longs to return to the past. . He always spoke about how loving and selfless his family was, how they helped others and how he had become a “ family ” with his neighbors. For this reason, I found the tone to be, loving and admiring his parents. This is because he explains how his parents were so brave to leave their life in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life. Narciso Rodriguez has also repeatedly pointed out how his parents have helped so many people in need. If in Rodriguez's position, I would love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless acts and their son's education.        

<START>

 

The mood that the author has created in the memories is love. the author discovers that the family does not have to be related by blood. In the author's neighborhood "despite customs from elsewhere, all these cultures have come together in solidarity and friendship" (@ NUM1). The author loves his parents because they came "like many immigrants, to give a better life to their children" (@ NUM2). The author is very grateful that his parents "The mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture" (@ NUM3). The author's parents gave him a great life by moving to @ LOCATION1 and "turned this simple house into @ NUM4).

Narciso is also grateful to have learned the true definition of "family". He is also very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice.       

<START>

 

The ambience certainly helps you to feel and understand the story better. The mood is both happy and sad because of the way the author presents his ideas. For example, the phrase "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a house" makes me sad because he grew up and everything is just memories now, but he keeps those happy memories. . Most of the other ideas like "I will be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" also carry the same reasons for being happy or sad. However, statements such as "My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture" make me happy that her parents were so determined. Overall, the main idea is to remember the good times and the bad times in your life and the mood for this idea is happy / sad.

In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir of "Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives", he / she incorporated love and passion into the mood. You can tell it by the way Narciso talks about certain things with tenderness and force. "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that embraced both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm homes." In that one sentence, you could feel Narciso's passion and love for this house of theirs. Narciso puts a lot of love and gratitude into the @ NUM1 and @ NUM2 paragraphs when talking about his parents. "It was here that I learned the true definition of 'family' ... I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a house." These two sentences are probably the strongest of Narciso's memories, these two are also the ones that are filled with more passion and meaning. As you can see, in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from "Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives", the vibe that Narciso puts there is love and passion.

The mood in the memoir that the author creates is a kind of very warm and relaxed mood. The way the author tells you about his parents ; selflessness and the way they put their children before them really makes you think about your own parents and how good they are to you and what they would do for you. The way the author talks about his house is reminiscent of all the colors in the house. I think the house would be a golden color - yellow red, white, brown and orange inside. It reminds me of how they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about the colors you have in your house and what you would cook with. The music sounds wonderful. Even if they don't show what it actually looks like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine her lying in the background while all the adults cook and the kids play in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining through an open window. I like the atmosphere in which this memoir puts me.

The mood created by the author in the memories was cheerful, pleasant and worth living. I say happy because they had family to be with and other friends to help them out when needed.

I would appreciate all my birthdays if I was this person and also my first friend. I also said it was worth living because they had food on their table everyday.

Narciso constantly thanks his parents for his heritage and their willingness to provide him with a better life. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @ CAPS1, Narciso uses parentheses to give more basic information. Narciso's memories were a very touching story. It made me feel like even in tough times people can find the right thing in things. This story reminds me of my dad because when things go wrong he can always make a joke or find the good side of the story.

the atmosphere was really uplifting and joyful. at first when describing his "home" he says that within these walls my young parents treated our traditional Cuban "home". You see how it's going from house to house, then you know it's a happy place for them. with their cuisine as the "heart" (happy heart) Cuban music fills the air / (which he adores). it's just a very uplifting story about how he was born into a Cuban, Spanish, Italian people facing racism and his parents welcome into their large extended family in sleep and eat everything. They are a good family and, as he said, the family is not related to blood, but rather to loving them as they come and always being in their homes. their family is carefree with love and courage, their parents taught them something special and how you can have more than a blood-related family. All you need is a little selfishness and a lot of courage.         

<START>

 

The mood in this memoir is love of heritage and love of family. This is what the author shows when he writes about his house and how we learn to love there. All the friendships he had and the family moments made him love his home. He shows warmth and love for his family and his home.   

<START>

 

I think the mood is happy. because Spanish and Italian Cubans are in the same neighborhood without a fight, and it seems they love life in the United States. 

<START>

 

I think the mood created by the author was happiness. I think this is because when @ CAPS1 spoke throughout the story, @ CAPS1 spoke about the quality of his life and the kindness of your parents. @ CAPS1 said his life was very good because @ CAPS1 grew up in a house that became a house. Also, @ CAPS1 talked about the great food that was going on in his house and all the great music that @ CAPS1 still loves today. Plus, @ CAPS1 shares how caring his parents were when they opened their doors to a family who needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Finally, I think the mood set by the author was happiness because @ CAPS1 had a lot of their family or close friends living above or below them. These are the reasons why I thought the mood set by the author was happiness.      

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the memories is that the family is very important. Family is very important, an example of this in the @ NUM1 paragraph is when author @ PERSON1 writes "Growing up in this environment has instilled in me a great sense that" family "has nothing to do with being. 'to be related by blood. "The second way that shows family is important is found in paragraph @ NUM2 when the author writes," I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The third and final example is found in paragraph @ NUM3 when the author writes: “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.” @ CAPS1 three examples show that family is the most important thing. 

<START>

 

The author's mood in this memoir was happy, grateful, and grateful. I say happy because in the story the author said "in our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I say happy because the author was happy to enjoy to have so many friends and family coming over everyday and having fun. another mood is full of the author as he says in the story "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and their sacrifice. The author says this because the author's parents loved him very much, they would go out every day trying to get money to make sure the author had a good life and the author was in it. grateful. Now the author was grateful for everything the author's parents did " parents created our traditional Cuban home " also " passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love for cooking " and " Where I celebrated my first birthdays ". The author was grateful for all of these things and more, because without the things his parents did, he would not be what he is today.          

<START>

 

I think the mood in this story was sad / happy. I think it was happy because he said he loved to cook And he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook. Also in paragraph @ NUM1 This is a paragraph dedicated to its parents. I think it's sad because in paragraph @ NUM2 it says his parents had really good jobs but when they came to the US they had to start over.       

<START>

 

In the brief, the different moods expressed. One of those moods was to appreciate, he appreciated that his parents made a home a home. They made him happy by the way his parents passed on their rich cooking skills and love of cooking and their passionate Cuban music that filled the air in his home. The author also expresses how grateful he is that his parents left their family, friends and careers in the country they loved so they could come to America, start their lives anew, have a better life for themselves. themselves and for themselves.

The author of the story created a vibe that you might feel all over while reading the article. The author created a feeling of togetherness and peace. He created this feeling because when reading he never uses a word about violence or hate. Also, as he reads, he recounts how he and his family always helped each other. He also considers his community family and it really makes you feel at peace inside.    

<START>

 

The movement that the author created in memories was that he did so so that there was still hope. Even if you are an immigrant, you can still make it to the top. The @ PERSON1 family left Cuba when racism was legal. The neighborhood was a family, or a unit. Now Narciso is a famous fashion designer. Coming from Cuba without starting a new life was very difficult     

<START>

 

In the memories of Narciso Rodriguez, the atmosphere created is happy and loving. In the brief, it is written: “In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship. @ CAPS1 people were very close to their family and @ CAPS2 discovered that you don't have to be a blood relative to be family. He also says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @ CAPS2 is happy that his parents moved to @ LOCATION1 and is grateful for the sacrifices they had to make to do so. “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. @ CAPS2 went from just living there at his home. @ CAPS2 appies everything his parents have done to improve his life.     

<START>

 

The mood the author created in memories is how she learned the definition of " family ". She learned the definition of " family " in what she calls her " simple house ". I know because in paragraph @ NUM1, she says "This is where I learned the definition of" family ".        

<START>

 

In the memoirs "Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the blueprints of Our Lives", the author creates a special atmosphere. I think the atmosphere is both happy and sad at the same time. It's sad because parents had to leave all of their family, friends and careers in Cuba, while coming to @ LOCATION1 without knowing the language. He didn't even meet his real grandparents until 1970, when they were allowed to leave Cuba. The atmosphere is happy too because the parents have done all this for their child. He can live a happy life in their new home, with their new friends.     

<START>

 

The atmosphere set by the author is very joyful. This is shown by explaining how happy it is to be a Cuban- @ CAPS1 and to be safe from the dark times. He also shows his happiness by explaining his qualities and his family. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez wants people to be happy with their lives, families and heritage. This is the atmosphere defined by Narciso Rodriguez.    

<START>

 

In this memoir gives a feeling of gratitude. Some of the reasons I think this is because, like in paragraph @ NUM1. The author says "... our neighborhood was made up mainly of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States". But the main part of the story is how he loves the neighborhood he lives in and the house he lives in and especially how basically family people are in that neighborhood. And that's why I think the author has a grateful mood in the memories.    

<START>

 

In the story "Narciso Rodriguez", the mood of the story is voluntary, grateful and full of hope. "The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times made them endure these difficult times" this quote shows that the family was ready to go through not having a good job like in Cuba. and segregation to make a better life for Their children. “My parents always kept the door open for those we considered family,” this quote shows that the family was thrilled to have a home and to let the people they loved live there with them. “My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language and culture. This quote showed that the family had enough hope that even without knowing the country, they still believed that he would bring a better life In the story "Narciso Rodriguez" the family was desperate for a better life.   

<START>

 

The vibe created by the author is visible, even if they are from Cuba they can still make a living and become bilingual, translate and help others find @ CAPS1. For example, " often someone stays with us temporarily until they can get back on their feet ." meaning he would help someone until he got a @ CAPS2 or @ CAPS3 an apartment that was good for him and what for a month if he had a job. Therefore, “my parents always kept their arms and doors open to many people we considered family” @ CAPS4 if they had any problems. Also, the mood was good because they came looking for an apartment and in the end everyone was happy because it had become their home.      

<START>

 

I think the author created a very warm and loving tone. Narciso created that vibe by including all of the biggest aspects of his home in @ LOCATION1. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1, he explains the endless celebrations he has had with his family and friends that "... formed the backdrop for life in our warm home".  

<START>

 

What I think, the vibe of this story is really sweet and explainable as it explains how these people immigrated from their country to where they now live just to have a better life. And they certainly did. They are happy with their home and @ CAPS1 is happy because of their amazing educational options. That's what I would say the vibe of this story is.  

<START>

 

During Narciso's life, growing up in a small house doesn't matter when you're around people you love. The author has created the mood for happiness, love, achievement and pride. Narciso was very proud of his Cuban heratige, as well as his courageous parents, who created a beautiful home and a great life for him. The atmosphere was also happy because it is a very happy story. There is also love and achievement to the vibe because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home, and childhood. The success was seeing her parents come to @ LOCATION1 and start a better life. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like this because being surrounded by your loved ones and being proud of yourself and your family is what matters.      

<START>

 

The mood created in this memoir was very grateful. Narciso was very, very grateful for the "house his parents turned into a house". And he was very grateful to his parents in general, for giving up their own life, for trying to give their son a better one, with a lot more opportunities than them. He is also grateful to his parents, not only for giving him things they never had, but also things they had. Things like teaching them how to cook, how to treat others, and a true sense of family. They also showed her the value of being selfless to someone you love.

No matter what your nationality, you can get along with anyone. He shows that his house, for him at least, was a wonderful @ CAPS1 with great smells, food and people. He is inexplicably happy and grateful for what his parents have done for him. For him, it was @ CAPS2 / heaven on earth. It was in the warmth of the kitchen of the humble home where a Cuban feast always filled the air not only with perfume and music, but with love and life. He will never forget this house or its gracious neighboring neighborhood.

The mood that was created by the author in the memories would be, I believe, love. I said love because throughout history all we talked about was "the eternal @ CAPS1", "a gold", the bonds and the oneness. The family is an immigrant and they came to seek a better way of life in a foreign country Just for the sake of the children. From my perspective, only a loving parent would leave the country they all love to do something like this because they had to leave behind families, friends, and careers. Now they face cultural hardships for just one decision.

The author created a mood in the memoir. The author creates an atmosphere of conviviality.

Unintentionally, they passed on to me rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that still accompanies me today (and for which I am forever grateful) Passionate Cuban music (which I still loved today) filled the air, mingling with the aromas of the cuisine. " I think the addition in parentheses makes it light and airy. His tone is delighted and grateful for his rich culture. The author's tone was very gentle, I think, when he thanked his parents. "But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity that has been imprinted on me ... and the demonstration of the importance of family and friends ... and these teachings have been the basis of my life. ” The mood of the memoirs is warm, joyful and sweet, thanks to the author.

The mood changed throughout the thesis. First of all, the mood started to get depressing saying that in Cuba they had a furnished one room apartment. That when they got to @ LOCATION1 and @ PERSON1 could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment. The following mood was inspiring. It was inspiring because the parents were a poor family and they found a way out of Cuba. Also because his parents altruously left Cuba so that the children could have a better place to live. Finally, there was a family atmosphere. They were honest, hard-working immigrants reaching out to help those in need. Plus, they've always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and also had surrogate grandparents Sergio and @ CAPS1. The mood changed throughout memory from depressing to inspiring and family it always was about.

The atmosphere that the author of this memoir is one of love and friendliness. The way he describes his parents' hard work and love is amazing. First, it says in @ CAPS2 @ NUM1 "In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a lab and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the US they had to start their lives over from scratch, taking any job that they could find. " It demonstrates a love beyond comperashin, as they had to start from scratch and step away from their potential to care for their children. They never gave up, but kept trying to give their children a better life than they would have had. Moreover, this memoir expresses unity not only in the family but in the community as a whole. As it says in @ CAPS2 @ NUM2 "… Our neighborhood was mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants…" @ CAPS1 although they were of all kinds of races "It was a tight-knit community of honest immigrants who were working hard who reached out to people who, while not necessarily of their kind, were clearly in need. " (@ CAPS2 @ NUM2) It was a community caring for each other and helping anyone who needed help despite the increase. Her parents also kept their doors open and allowed people to come in and stay until they could get back on their feet. Knowing that they would do the same for them. It takes a very close community to be able to do something like this. These are just a few of the different examples in this memoir that illustrate the mood the author creates of love and togetherness.

This memoir had a theme that meant a lot of different things. A theme was helpful. The family moved to @ LOCATION1 from Cuba in 1956 and had many problems and difficulties. Because they know what it is that they decided to help other people in trouble and let them stay with them; that's exactly what they did. Another theme that struck me as appropriate was inspiration. I think this family inspired not only their children but also other neighbors and other parents. Finally, I think another theme in this excerpt was heart - feeling. The @ CAPS1 - @ CAPS2 family risked everything to help other families. It is a very good action that they have taken against them. One person can slowly tell the difference, person by person; that's exactly what this family did.

The mood that the author has created in memory is united, caring, loving and more. The author combines all these moods and memories to write this memoir, that's what a memoir is ; yourself, your memories, your family, etc. One of the reasons the author created moods is because a house is a family that lives together and they keep memories together that show love. For example in the memoir, "Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that embraced both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. . " Which is obviously the mood to love, because there is all a loving family together. A second reason the author created is the mood because in the place where the author lived there were a lot of different people from different places. Although they were not all the same, they acted like family and were united. For example, “in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship”. which means that even if it is different, there will be one for the other that is united. A third reason why the author created moods is because the author's parents not only took care of themselves, but also of others, just like their children. For example, “ They selflessly come, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. " This means that her parents are not only cared for them, but for the future of their son. The whole story is based on home and family, but the point is that a home and a family will always share the love, care and unity of one another.

" It shows a happy @ CAPS1 as they welcome people into their family. Another @ CAPS1 in history is sad. One example is when it says "I couldn't afford to move into a modest three-room apartment". It is also written, “ They had difficulties both personally and financially. It's a sad @ CAPS1 because they are struggling to get by.

This is how the atmosphere is interesting of the author's creation  

<START>

 

The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. The reason I say this is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents who left everything behind so he could have a better life. He also seemed grateful when he spoke about the fact that the Spaniards, Cubans and Italians in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist towards each other. He also mentioned that he had learned the meaning of " family " while living in this house. By "family" he did not mean the blood related family. What he means by family is everyone who would come to his apartment and everyone in the building was also part of the family. The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful.        

<START>

 

This memorial created a warm and touching atmosphere as it explained his childhood. I think especially of the part where he said "Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that made up the two, formed the backdrop of life. in our warm home ", because it shows a global perspective on a normal day during her childhood. Also when he states that family "has nothing to do with being a blood relative makes his memior really interesting because it also teaches lessons. Overall this memior was awesome, and the warm atmosphere is something that I will not forget, and I hope that I too can write a memoir as heartwarming and interesting as this.

For example, "Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban house, whose very heart was the kitchen." @ CAPS1 the parts where the mood was very happy were probably the parts he remembered the most in detail. For example, "My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich cooking skills and a love of cooking that remains with me today."

The atmosphere created by the memoirs "Narciso Rodriguez" is very uplifting and happy. One of the reasons I think the memories are uplifting and happy is because they are about Narciso's gratitude to his parents. In paragraph @ NUM1 it says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." I thought this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he basically thanks his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in the @ NUM2 paragraph it says "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great feeling that" family "had nothing to do with it. a blood relative. " I found this uplifting because basically what he says family doesn't always mean who you're bonded with but the people around you who love and support you. Finally, this article is edifying because it shows that love can make a difference.

In the thesis, the mood that the author created is the thesis can be @ CAPS1 in two ways. The first was happy to have been created and to be able to use the beautiful friendliness of America. "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great feeling that 'family' has nothing to do with a blood relative." @ CAPS2 was knowing that if you have hope anything can be done. "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.    

<START>

 

In this thesis, the author creates a very specific atmosphere which is the same throughout the thesis. The mood for this memoir was a heartwarming and happy mood. One of the reasons this mood was @ CAPS1 was that they talked about how their surroundings showed a great sense of family and when I think of family I consider the vibe to be heartwarming and happy. " Growing up in this environment gave me a great feeling that family has nothing to do with being a blood relative ." It showed the vibe because her family always greeted people and made them feel welcome @ CAPS2 because the vibe was heartwarming and happy is she spoke about the kindness and kindness of people with everyone those they met. "It was a tight community of honest and hardworking immigrants who reached out to people who, while not necessarily of their own kind, were clearly in need." This is how the brief showed a happy and heartwarming mood.

In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author in the memoir is that together the family is organized. My parents both shared the cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich cooking skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today "The parents are really together to organize the family. That's the vibe. created by the author in the thesis.

The mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is lava. An example of the text reads “My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind families, friends and careers in the country they loved. ” @ CAPS1 example from text says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I often told them that what they had done was a much braver thing than I could ever have done. I have often told them my admiration for strength and perseverance, and I have thanked them on several occasions. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity that permeated me at such a young age and demonstrating how important family and friends are. " In conclusion, because of his parents' love for him, they sacrificed a lot so that he could have a happy and good life.   

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy. The reason I say this is because if my parents would do this I would be very grateful because they did all of this to make me happy and have a better life. "And for which I am eternally grateful". "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life." Wow that @ CAPS1 a lot of his parents they are very strong and they did everything to make their kids happy. This is the reason why I have chosen these two moods in the memories!     

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the memoir is a lot. But, I think the main moods in the memories are happy and grateful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @ PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @ PERSON1 said "here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." And, I think the vibe of the story is grateful as well as a lot of the story has to do with @ PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they did and sacrificed for him. For example, at the end of the memoir @ PERSON1 says "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see, these are the moods that I think the author created in the memories.       

<START>

 

The atmosphere created in this memoir is very much linked to the house. Shocking was how the parents transformed the “ simple house ” into a “ traditional Cuban house ”. Parents played "passionate Cuban music". and “ love of cooking ” helped create a family atmosphere, and it showed how much they love their heritage. “ Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great feeling that ' family ' had nothing to do with being a holdover. This family enjoyed spending time together and partying. Overall the mood is one of love, joy and care. .             

<START>

 

The vibe I got when I read the @ CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez was a sense of oneness. I got this mood because he always talks about being with his family and how the house he was raised in really brought all of his family together and it made him proud of his family. and its Cuban culture. His family meant a lot to him, so another mood might be love because of his love for his family and the house he grew up in where he learned to love. His parents did a lot for him and "turned their simple house into a house." He learned everything he could think of from his parents and he loves them very much. These are the moods I felt while reading Narciso Rodriguez.     

<START>

 

In the memories of Narciso Rodriguez, @ CAPS1 created a certain atmosphere. Narciso Rodriguez created a soft atmosphere that has remained constant. @ CAPS1 tells how her parents "always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we consider family." Which means @ CAPS1 probably grew up living a life without too much violence. @ CAPS1 also says that @ CAPS1 "will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice". @ CAPS1 wants his parents to know that @ CAPS1 loves them very much and to let them know by thinking of them. Finally @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 says that @ CAPS1 "will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a house". The sense of gentleness remains throughout the thesis because @ CAPS1 always says the good things with his life, not the bad ones.

The atmosphere created by the @ CAPS2 in the memories was happy. The first thing @ CAPS1 is happy about in this brief is when @ CAPS2 wrote "Passionate Cuban Music (which I still adore today)" which means @ CAPS3 really loves his cultural music. Another thing is when @ CAPS3 said "Growing up in this environment gave me a great feeling that 'family' has nothing to do with being a blood relative, and for that you don’t have anything to do with being a blood relative. don't need to be related to someone who really loves saying that he / @ CAPS3 is @ CAPS5 from your family is just enough that he / @ CAPS3 loves and cares for you like you for him / @ CAPS3 The last thing is when the @ CAPS2 said "I'll never forget how my parents turned it from a simple house to a house, that meant @ CAPS3 would never forget his family started so small And then grew. great because her family went to her house and started her new life in the house.

The mood created in memories is the feeling of Cuban culture and the home of @ CAPS1. The feeling could be described as intimate. In paragraph @ NUM1, it is here that the @ CAPS1 introduces for the first time the custom of his house. And how it is. The @ CAPS1 describes his house as simple with Cuban music and the smell of Cuban food running through it. The feeling @ CAPS1 uses to describe their house is the feeling everyone in the brief had. The house somehow inundated the memior with his feelings. Plus, this memory didn't just show the Cuban feeling, it also gave some family vibes (like how happy and together a family is). He expressed how close @ CAPS1 was to his family

The atmosphere created by the author in this memoir is both joyful and uplifting but also sad. Examples of how happy he is is how the author describes in paragraph @ NUM1 how his parents were able to afford to move into a better and bigger house ", twenty-one @ PERSON2 and twenty-seven years old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest @ NUM2 room apartment. " @ CAPS1's example of happiness is when he describes when his parents decorated the apartment to make it look like a traditional Cuban house, "Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban house." @ CAPS1 example of happiness is when he describes his community of united and hardworking immigrants, "In our neighborhood, all of these cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship." And the last example is when he mentions that a lot of his family and friends adorn the kitchen table more often than not. The mood changes about halfway through the memoir at paragraph @ NUM3 when it says, "Even if that meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved." This is when parents leave Cuba and their families and friends to live at @ LOCATION1. @ CAPS1 example of sadness is when he says "The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved." This means parents will have a much harder time finding a job at @ LOCATION1, and they might not be getting the pay they deserve.

I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, always talks about how grateful he is to his parents who helped him as a child. In paragraph @ NUM1, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." In addition, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story says, "Back in the days when overt racism was the norm ... All cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." Even though there is racism, @ CAPS1 we are friends.

The general mood in Narciso's memories is admiration and gratitude towards his parents. He expresses his gratitude on several occasions. As in paragraph @ NUM1.

They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even if that meant leaving family, friends and careers in the country they love.

"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I often told them that what they had done was a much braver thing than I could have done." parents.

In Narciso Rodriguez's non-fiction memoir "Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives", Narciso talks about his life growing up, his home, and the people around him. The author also considered the family of his neighbors, rather than just his parents and siblings. “Growing up in this environment gave me a great feeling that 'family' has nothing to do with being a blood relative ... a tight-knit community.” (by @ NUM1) It gives the thesis a friendly atmosphere, it shows that the author loved his whole neighborhood. The author also invited his neighbors to his house and was very close to them. “Our owner and her daughter, Alegria… lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table… most of the time. Also at the table… my surrogate grandparents.” (by @ NUM2) It gives the memoir an inviting vibe, the author always had friends and neighbors over for dinner.

The ambience created in this brief is comfort. To me, it's so heartwarming because it's such a happy memory, where these two young people are inviting other people to their place all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not a shred of sadness for me, just a happy, welcoming family that comforts me. Another thing is the way of life. I love how proud they are of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and still cook their Cuban food. I like it when people aren't afraid to be themselves. It comforts me to know that everyone is happy. That is why the ambience created in this memoir for me is comfort.

Narciso Rodriguez creates a really original atmosphere in the extract. I would say it puts a kind of grateful mood into the snippet. He constantly declares how grateful he is to his parents for their selflessness and courage. An example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says, “I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I often told them that what they had done was a much braver thing and I could have done it. To do." This quote shows how grateful Narciso is for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows immense gratitude is when he says, "They came, like many immigrants, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving their family, friends and careers behind. the country they love ”.

I believe the mood created by the author is happy and loving. In paragraph @ NUM1 it says "Growing up in this environment gave me a great feeling that family has nothing to do with being a blood relative." @ CAPS1 Not only are people related to your blood your family, but also your friends and anyone close to you. The extract also states "It is in this very simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival in this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays". It shows the love that everyone has for each other. Finally, the excerpt states, "It was in the warmth of the kitchen of this humble home where a Cuban feast always filled the air not only with perfume and music, but with life and love. It is here that I learned the true definition of family. " This part makes you feel warm and happy as a family.

People make sacrifices for their loved ones. This is called being altruistic. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless. They left their family and friends to give their son a better life. The author creates a pleasant and comforting atmosphere. Narciso is very grateful. He said he "learned the definition of 'family'". His parents wanted a better life for him. They have given up a lot and he recognizes it. Rodriguez realized that his parents were working very hard. He respected his parents and loved them for everything they had done for him. "I often tell them that what they did was a much braver thing than I ever could have done." It is a great feeling to know that someone will do anything for you. Family is very important. @ PERSON1 mentioned that his neighbors were all immigrants. They had also left their families; and only had the other. Knowing that you have people who are like family is amazing. While they can never replace parents with blood, friends are the second best thing. I think that growing up @ PERSON1 learned some very important lessons. Put others before you and work hard.

The mood created by the author in the memories is love. I think the mood is for love because he talks about the love and support of his whole family. One example is when he says "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if that meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in the country they were living in. liked. " To me that meant how much his parents loved him so much (even though he was not yet born) that they sacrificed everything they had for their children. That's why I think the mood is for love.

In this memoir, the author creates a very soothing and relaxing atmosphere. The author explained that family is not about blood, and a house doesn't have to be spectacular to be a home. The authors said in the memoir "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a house." It basically means that with all the love and care his parents had for him and his neighbors, he created a great place to live. The atmosphere also very optimistic. This is because the author's parents came to America with nothing, but with all of their hard work overcoming their difficulties and helping everyone in their neighborhood. Another mood in the story was an affectionate mood, because even though his neighbors were not his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were.

The mood created by the author in the memories is very gentle and compassionate. The reason I would describe the vibe as sweet and compassionate is. When Narciso Rodriguez describes growing up with his parents and in Cuba, he never said anything about what he hated about his family and about life in Cuba. yet he describes everything he loved as a child, for example he says "Growing up in this environment gave me a great feeling that" family "had nothing to do with being a parent. by blood. It shows that just because your not blood-bound doesn't mean you are not family.

The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness of parents towards their children, friends and family. They would do nice things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for themselves and their children. The sense of greatness comes from friends and family, since parents were so generous, people were grateful, and so was the author.

His parents taught him to cook dishes from his country and also to dance to Cuban music as it is said in paragraph @ NUM3. These are the types of mood described in the memoir.

The mood created by the author in the memories is grateful, happy and loving his life. First of all, the mood created by the author in the memoirs is grateful. Here is a quote from the text. “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.” @ CAPS1, the mood created by the author in memories is happy. Here is the proof of the article.

The atmosphere created by the author is touching. I think the vibe is touching because Narciso Rodriguez talks about how his neighborhood was made up mostly of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In addition, because he had to share a house with a lot of people, his parents had personal and financial difficulties and his parents could not find a job. That's why I think the atmosphere is touching.   

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the memoir is the beginning of the memoir, he tells how his parents struggled to come to another country and face many problems and the mood is really sad or with a lot of suspense and through the in the midst of the memoirs he tells how he grew up in a family where everyone was so happy and almost everyone lived together and they had a lot of feasting and that mood turned into a more cheerful or cheerful mood he had with his family, and in the end he talks about it, he thanks his parents for who he is and all the opportunities they give him that change the mood to a grateful or grateful mood. And this is how the author creates all the moods on the memory. 

<START>

 

The mood created by the author was mainly happiness and gratitude. Narciso's parents came to @ LOCATION1 with courage without any knowledge of the language or culture. Narciso feels grateful and gracious to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Throughout the brief, the designer is happy. He explained how peaceful and grateful his life with his "family" was while keeping the Cuban culture and heritage. The author stated that the meaning of family has nothing to do with being a blood relative.

The atmosphere created by the author was for me apprehension and sympathy. Here are @ NUM1 people who have given up on their homes, jobs, families, friends in the hope that they can live a better life with their son at @ LOCATION1. I have a lot of trepidation because this is just another example of how much our parents love and want the best for us. I feel a little bad for the parents because they came from Cuba and moved to @ LOCATION1. They did not know the language, they had to relearn everything and look for a job that would accept immigrants. Most jobs don't take any imaginations, so parents had to work hard to provide for their son. The love and dedication our parents put into giving us the best is incredible. The mood was apprehensive and sympathetic to the people in this story.       

<START>

 

The mood in this memoir can best be described as happy. The author puts a real nostalgia for happy memories in the memories. One of the memories is cooking. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also remembers his friends and friends he used to have at his house. Even during a time of racism @ CAPS1.SA friends always found ways to make them all happy and it has been a long time. Another fond memory he remembers is that of his parents who taught him life lessons. He says his parents were scientists back in Cuba but moved to @ LOCATION1 in order to have a better home. It taught her a lesson that families can count more than money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says he finds the true definition of family.

The author of the memoirs, Narciso Rodriguez creates a benevolent, happy and thoughtful atmosphere. By evoking the Cuban traditions shared in the neighborhood with close friends, and by cooking in the kitchen to share a good meal with each other, the atmosphere is in a good mood. When Narciso talks about the great friends he has made from different legacies and knowing the whole community like family, the vibe is thoughtful and caring as it shows that people really appreciate each other's company. He's also thoughtful in the story when Narciso talks about how his parents dedicated their lives to making sure their kids and the people they knew had good lives. When Narciso describes how his parents struggled through the cold winters, but always let others in, shows a very caring mood that is remembered. I also think that the fact that a simple little apartment they lived in is very important to Narciso because he repeats it many times. I think he does this to show a thoughtful mood, in that the house was small but thanks to his creativity in bringing the culture, it seemed a lot bigger.      

<START>

 

The atmosphere created by the author was one of happiness, love and kindness. Not only does it show in her style, but the author also gives details that really set the mood. In paragraph @ NUM1, the author describes the food as " rich cooking skills and a love of cooking " and the music as " passionate Cuban music ... blending with the aromas of cooking ". This creates a warm effect on the stage, as well as the paragraph about the many "family members" who have come for meals. The author describes this and explains that it was all possible, despite the racism of the nation, because his parents worked hard to get to where they were, convinced that their children would have better lives than them. With all the details, the author creates a loving cultural affect that can only be found with great family and friends.

Happiness is the mood described in the memoirs of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the brief that he is happy with the choice his parents had to make for him. The result is success. Another example of a time the writer has shown happiness for his parents is the culture he has just shown that he is Cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memories, his two parents had come to America far from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @ CAPS1, but they were desperate to make it work for their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents have done for him, it shows some of the things that are happening in his life.      

<START>

 

The author creates an atmosphere that he is very grateful to his parents. His parents taught him to cook Cuban style (which he loves to cook). "(and for which I am eternally grateful)." Its main great fullness is their love and sacrifice. They were welcoming someone who needed time to get back on their feet, which he found incredible. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." And he is not afraid to let them know, “I have often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I have thanked them time and time again. @ CAPS1 memories, the author creates an atmosphere that he is grateful to all his parents, love and sacrifices, not only to himself, but to all those they have helped.

I feel like there is one main mood which is gratitude made up of many different moods. The other moods are reminiscence and happiness. Gratitude centers on the @ NUM1 and @ NUM2 paragraphs. Narciso Rodriguez says he's thankful his parents gave up so much to come to @ LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He also shares how his parents taught him how important family and friends are. He was reminiscent of what his house looked like and what the people who made it up looked like. Finally the happiness which is especially his mood when he remembers his past and his family.

The author creates a loving and caring atmosphere. It gives the impression that you too could be invited into their home with open arms. That if you were feeling down, they would come and pick you up with a hot meal and a cozy pearl. He describes that they left Cuba to come to the land of opportunity. May this family be filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @ CAPS1.    

<START>

 

In the memories of Narciso Rodriguez, it gives a sure and happy mood. The paragraph @ NUM1 explains a traditional Cuban house, with food and music and everything. It's like that with me, just with @ CAPS1 stuff, not Cuban. Further, the narrator explains that everyone in the neighborhood was a tight-knit family of Cubans, Spaniards and Italians. No one would get hurt and everyone would help if something went wrong, giving a feeling of security. Finally, the whole paragraph @ NUM2 and @ NUM3 explains how his parents risked everything to be in @ CAPS2. My parents did the same and it makes me happy that they did. So it's probably the same for the narrator. In conclusion, the brief has a good and happy mood.        

<START>

 

the mood created by the author in the memoirs was mutulated at first, it was about moving to a new country, they seemed to face it, they were more inclined to give their child a better life and in the end, it really looks like they were all happy they welcomed people who moved from somewhere to their house and welcomed them i think overall it was a good mood that was created by the author

<START>

 

The atmosphere created @ CAPS1 the author in memory was grateful and affectionate.

" @ CAPS1 means to me that anyone can be your family.       

<START>

 

I think the general mood created by the author is comfort. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1, the author writes: “Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mingling with the aromas of the cuisine. the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good idea of what it was like to grow up in his house. It is heartwarming that they have taken in loved ones and helped them get their lives back on track. In paragraph @ NUM2, he wrote: ". Countless members of the extended family came and went - and there was often someone who temporarily stayed with us until he can rebuild" the family knew their family would do the same for them if they ever needed a place to stay. Finally, the amount of love and kindness in the house is very strong. The @ NUM3 paragraph shows how much the author cares about and is very grateful to his parents. the comforting feeling of home is very important for Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also for his very large family.      

<START>

 

The author's mood was amazing and towards the end it changed your happiness. I thought the mood was early because he was wondering what "home" was like. Then it was changed to happiness because now the author knew what "home" is.

Fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez is a firm believer in the values of friendship and family. In a selection from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, he describes the mood, or feeling created by an author as a child, that of family and caring people. Narciso says everyone in his neighborhood was "immigrants who reached out to people who, while not necessarily of their kind, were clearly in need." This shows usefulness especially at a time when racism and segregation were significant in the United States. Second, there was a feeling of family among everyone in Narciso's household. There were often people who stayed in her house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. The Rodriguez believed these people would do the same for them in return. Finally, Narciso cannot express how grateful he is for having the importance of friends and family so early in his life. Without his parents pointing out that family is not just your blood relationship, he never would have thought that family and helping hands were so important. An atmosphere of family qualities and helpfulness prevails in Narciso Rodriguez's memories.

The @ CAPS1 is written in first person narration. The @ CAPS2 sets the tone with and on how he is so proud of his relationship and marriage with Cuba. He is also very happy and proud to have great parents, a great home and very precious memories of all of these things. He also explains and talks about other people and the difficulty of leaving Cuba and coming to America. This is how @ CAPS1 sets the tone for this story.

In the memories "Narciso Rodriguez", what is the atmosphere created by the author? The atmosphere that the authors create by writing this passage is very cultural. Because she reasons. Let him use good details to describe the character's house. For example, Cuban music @ CAPS1 (which I still adore today). It shows that there was some beautiful cultural music. Another way is that he's in a cultural mood when he says. "My young parents created our traditional Cuban house." This shows that they took what they had in Cuba and brought it to @ LOCATION1. Also that they wanted it to be like home they miss. But I think the cultural vibe is one of the most important. This is what I showed you in these two paragraphs.         

<START>

 

A house is not a house without a family, and a family is not a family without its paths, its struggles and its happiness. The mood in the memories was to show what family is, that it is much more than blood. It is unity, friendship and laughter, it is tears, pain and sorrow. It's about how you can start in the slums and move up through the ranks, but one thing will never change, and that is family. The home does not matter on the physical space of the accommodation, but on the relationships and memories you create there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happiness, and imagination come together in a disorganized way, but that doesn't mean that there won't be trails like the racism to which almost all minorities have to face, even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I take care of it, I get called cracker and n **** on a daily fuck, I don't know how I could get by without family.

The author of this memoir has put a damper on it. The atmosphere is very affectionate, as the parents have given everything to make their child's life easier. There is also a very friendly and caring feeling because the article says their neighborhood is mostly immigrant and it is a tight-knit community of honest and hardworking immigrants who have reached out to the people in need.

<START>

 

The mood the author was trying to convey was calm. I think that's what he was trying to show because Narciso is about his family and his childhood. Narciso also spoke about the kinds of things that happened with him as a child. One thing he talked about was his owner's daughter being his first babysitter and first friend. He also shared how his parents showed him their cooking skills and their passion for cooking.    

<START>

 

The atmosphere created by the author in the memories is awesome @ CAPS1. Narciso loved to cook. "A love of cooking that still accompanies me today." Narciso loved his parents very much. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." The Rodriguez family help people come into their homes. "It is in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival in this country". It was the mood created by the author in the memoir.       

<START>

 

In these memoirs, Narciso explains how difficult it was to be raised by immigrant parents at @ LOCATION1, get dirty jobs for low pay, but his home is his home, where all his memories are. In my opinion, his mood is happy and joyous, depending on how much he talks about his house.

The author created an atmosphere in Les Mémoires. The author uses a mood from @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 The memoir. The author showed this by "alegrai graced our kitchen table more often than not". This shows that the author used a mood from @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 The thesis   

<START>

 

Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez is a memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives and it is about the youth of Narciso Rodriguez. The main mood in memories is honesty and truthfulness. This is because the author is talking about what you don't want to hear or what makes you sad to hear. For example, the author tells us about racism and how it was normal in the United States but the community overcame it: “a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation reigned in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a tight-knit community of honest and hardworking immigrants who reached out to people who, while not necessarily of their kind, were clearly in need. "(@ NUM1). In conclusion, the vibe of the thesis is honesty and truthfulness because the author tells us things that could make us uncomfortable.    

<START>

 

The mood in this memoir, I believe, is appreciation and caring for others. @ The NUM1 house and the neighborhood were a place of unity and care for each other as a family. In the memories it is said that people always came in and out of the house for a place to stay or for a meal to eat and were always greeted with open arms. "Family" to him did not mean that you were related, but that you were loved and cared for by others and with that mindset he had a large family. His parents left their lives in Cuba where they were both scientists and had friends and family there for their son. They knew the United States had better opportunities for Narciso (in which he became a designer). He repeatedly states how grateful he is to his parents for moving into @ LOCATION3 for him and making his house feel like home.           

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the thesis is. First of all, the moon which I think is warm and says that there is nothing better than being at home. In @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 it is stated that all these cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship like at home and that the people around us are like family and we come to unite as friends and families. Narciso Rodriguez also says in paragraph @ NUM2 "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a house. To complete my description of the ambiance created by the author in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, there is has no place like feeling at home.

In the memoir, “Narciso Rodriguez” of Home: The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 of our Lives, the author's general mood is greatness.

(For which I am eternally grateful) "@ CAPS3 has an upbeat outlook on all aspects of her family and culture. This was mainly due to the way @ CAPS3 grew up and was born into a family that had just finished struggling to enter @ LOCATION1.

The atmosphere created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @ PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he has had and the memories that have taken place at his home. In the second paragraph, he reflects on how he lived in his traditional Cuban home, where the heart was the kitchen. He remembers his parents' love for cooking and how eternally grateful he is that it was passed on to him. @ PERSON1 remembers the passionate Cuban music mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. In paragraphs three and four, he recounts how the environment he grew up in instilled that "family" had nothing to do with a blood relative. He remembers former neighbors, his surrogate grandparents, aunts and cousins. @ PERSON1 remembers that there was always someone at the table, and usually someone who stayed with them until they could get back on their feet. In paragraphs five, six and seven, @ PERSON1 expresses his gratitude to his parents and how much they had to sacrifice.

The mood was a little sad at times and grateful at others. It was sad that they have to leave Cuba and start all over again. It was great because they had a family that loved them and took care of them.

The mood created by the author in the memoirs was grateful, happy and grateful.

Narciso was grateful because he has a house he can sleep in, a family that loves him, and he couldn't have asked for anything better than the life he has now.

The mood of the brief is appreciation. I think it's that mood because in the last paragraph the author says: "... I will never forget this gracious house or its neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love .

In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood saw themselves as family, even though they all struggled to get bought. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot. Narciso's parents had highly skilled and well paying jobs in Cuba and they were forced to get any jobs they could find at @ LOCATION2. They always helped someone in their family when needed, and often did. Narciso's family tried their best to be poor and managed to get by. They did all of this without losing their culture (Cuban music and food). Their whole neighborhood, one big family, survived and prospered on little. Being a blood relative wasn't the only definition of family in their part of Newark, New Jersey.

In the memories, @ ORGANIZATION1 the mood created @ ORGANIZATION1 the @ CAPS3 is hard and happy. The first place in history the @ CAPS3 creates a tough mood is when they say racism is overt.

The last place in history where the author creates a good mood is when the neighborhood has come together. "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together and a great solidarity and friendship". It displays a good mood because it represents a whole bunch of different people coming together to work together. As you can see, @ CAPS3 creates two different types of hard and happy moods.

@ ORGANIZATION1 tells the story of his childhood and the good times of his family "in a small house in Newark. Rodriguez shares a unique feeling of happiness with this excerpt ; the feeling of good memories which grow stronger every day. The phrases he uses to describe the house as "passionate Cuban music filled the air" and "the family congregation" created that vibrant and happy feeling of the welcoming home he grew up in. The excerpt reinforces those feelings when the author tells of how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own. Describing these attitudes and selfless ways helps paint a beautiful picture of a family, with the "extended family" "too, forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen As the author goes on to relate how grateful he is to his parents and his wonderful childhood and ch aleureuse, it offers a serene and down-to-earth honesty on the part of the author. feel the good times of a carefree life and carefree days which provide a wonderful atmosphere for the reader.

The mood created by the author is the sadness of living in a country where his friends and family lived. Looking forward to the moments they shared in the United States. As the memoir indicates, the center of the house was the kitchen where parents shared cooking chores and where passionate Cuban music filled the air with the aroma of cooking. In the kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home. The author also creates an atmosphere filled with his hope of creating a better life for the family, even if it meant leaving his country, friends and family.

In this memoir, I think the atmosphere created is very peaceful, happy and warm. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parents were, as they left their entire lives behind in Cuba to give their children a better life at @ LOCATION1. Their house was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cuisine and music. Family members are always present, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up, in my opinion. After reading this memoir, I had a warm feeling inside of me and I started to think of places like my home that make me feel this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to have been brought up this way.

The author in the memoir of Home: The Blueprints of our lives creates an atmosphere of gratitude and admiration towards his parents. An example of how the author shows his gratitude is to mention how grateful he is to his parents. Specific textual evidence that proves that it is "... unwittingly imparted to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that still accompanies me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)." This quote creates an atmosphere of appreciation by simply stating " forever grateful ." Additionally, another textual evidence that proves my thesis is "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @ CAPS1 that the authors use and the repetition of the word "grateful" or "thanking" creates a mood. Another example of how the author creates a mood is to show admiration for his parents. According to the text, he says "I have often said my admiration for their strength and perseverance". This quote is important because it shows that he told them that he admires them. The author also creates an atmosphere of admiration when he says "... what they did was a much braver thing than I could have done." @ CAPS2 this quote the author acknowledges that his parents faced many hardships, and praises them by showing his admiration.

In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful atmosphere. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation. The author's voice is very dull. for example, he describes his house as a " simple house " several times in his memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple house, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. It gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves them hanging or wondering about something. To help it, the author uses a lot of unusual punctuation. Parentheses are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with hyphens. This punctuation is used to give additional information, such as the age of "Rawedia Maria, twenty-one" or "Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today)". When the author gives additional information, it gives the reader a feeling of peace and makes him feel "at home", which is the subject of the dissertation.

In this memoir, the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who care so much about him that they moved to the United States to provide him with a better life than he did. he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food his mother prepared and taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segregation from whites to other races and because of this his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they had nothing to prove. . Their house was always open to anyone who needed it, and their parents would feed them and be generally kind to them. This memoir is about the kind and loving family of Narciso Rodriguez, and it stands out strongly in his story.

For example, (paragraph @ NUM1, last sentence) “ The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times has pushed them. (his parents) to endure these difficult times.

The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a certain atmosphere in his memoirs. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family are in a good mood is due to the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author begins by saying that family has nothing to do with realists of blood. It's also because everyone, even if they weren't related, was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandmother, grandfather, etc. One reason this is love is because he loved everyone in his family. They always came and dined to keep it and stuff, that's why that's love.

While reading the article, also called memory, I did not find so much a certain atmosphere that the author had created. This memoir is indeed heartwarming and touching, although it is very inspiring. He teaches, at least he taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely dreamed of coming to America to raise a family and they accomplished it with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what atmosphere this author created, I would say happiness. The reason is that Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article says, his parents had a talent for cooking that passed on to Narciso and he was grateful for it. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness simply because of who his family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them.

And he even spoke about his community " It was a tight knit community of honest and hardworking immigrants who held out hand to people who, without being were clearly in need.

The way this author wrote this memoir, he @ CAPS1 created several moods. The main mood he created was gratitude. He continues to say how grateful he is that his parents had an abortion to make him better. The author emphasizes how grateful he is that his parents did this for him. Since his parents did this for him, he even became a clothing designer. The author of this brief is very grateful. This author also creates other moods such as happiness and sadness.

Although they are not blood related, they have formed family-like relationships. Moreover, says the author, "a Cuban feast always filled the air not only with perfume and music, but also with life and love".

<START>

 

In the memories of Narciso Rodriguez, he created an atmosphere of happiness and joy. Narciso Rodriguez creates this atmosphere by showing the generosity of his parents towards their son, their family and their friends. I also feel another mood that Narciso expresses is love. I say this because his parents sacrifice everything they had because they wanted a better life for their son. "The faith that this struggle has led them and their children to better times has made them endure these difficult times." In this quote is love. Narciso's parents learned that in order for him to have a better life, they would have to sacrifice his. That's why I think love is a mood presented in memories.

In the Memoirs of Narciso Rodriguez The author gives the impression that the atmosphere is firm and affectionate. It created a very uplifting and loving vibe as if to say your childhood and family are the heart of your home. In paragraph two, the author states that he had lived in a house where there were celibates, which formed the backdrop to life in his warm home. What the author means is that family and friends have made the house attractive and worthwhile. The author also explains by repeating paragraph four "My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." This smell explains that even though there were no friends and family to go, they were still welcome in their home. This memoir creates a very loving mood. In the last paragraph, the author explains that home is where he learned the true definition of family and love.

There are three things that describe @ CAPS1 in this brief. one of them is the love of the authors for its Cuban heritage. “@ CAPS2 Cuban music [which I still love today] filled the air, mixing the aroma of cooking. Another way the author describes @ CAPS1 are the houses his parents owned." 1961 I was born into this simple house, located in a two-family blond brick building in @ CAPS4 linked to @ CAPS5 in Newark, New Jersey. ”The last thing that describes @ CAPS1 is love and sacrifice which they gave to their son. ”It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees To celebrate the arrival of @ CAPS7 in this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. “ Cuban cuisine and music were there.

The mood in the memories is happy and grateful. I think this because the memoir is about how this boy feels his parents moved out just so he could have a better life. I know this because in the last paragraph the boy talks about his family and how he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home. So this is the mood of the thesis.

In the memoir, the author created a mood. The vibe was great and shows anyone reading it that the human race can be really kind and helpful. No matter what race you are or where you come from, you don't have to be blood related to be " family " and we can all reach out to those who need it most. aid. The author's parents gave him great love and sacrificed a lot for him; @ CAPS1 is very grateful to them. @ CAPS1 tells them that what they did was a much braver thing than @ CAPS1 could ever have done and @ CAPS1 has great admiration for their strength and perseverance. As an immigrant you have to be selfless because most parents do this to give their children a better life. The author has learned the true definition of "family" and for that, @ CAPS1 said that @ CAPS1 will never forget this house or the many things on how to love. In the memories, it creates a peaceful atmosphere.

Everyone can do it. It doesn't matter what you look like or anything, and what your home looks like you are still you.

In the excerpt "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the author leaves a friendly, compassionate and gracious mood. This excerpt leaves a friendly atmosphere because of the friendliness that the Narciso Rodriguez district gives to his young age. In our district, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a tight-knit community of honest and hardworking immigrants who reached out to people who, while not necessarily of their kind, were clearly in need. a lot of compassion that Narciso's parents have shown to families of friends who need a boost or help getting back on their feet. feet. My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family ... "(@ CAPS1 @ NUM2) Rodriguez leaves a grateful mood as he continues to thank his parents for their love." I will always be greater for my parents for their love and sacrifice ... admiration for their strength and perseverance ... and these teachings have been the basis of my life. Rodriguez uses these wonderful moods to describe his wonderful parents.    

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the memoirs is the one that is used in many memoirs because they are like things: someone will never forget as the author said "my parents shared the tasks cooking and unwittingly imparted to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that remains with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air, mingling with the aromas of the cuisine. That's all he'll ever do Forget.

<START>

 

The mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love. One type of mood in this story is uplifting happiness. You can see it because throughout the story there is so much positivity and warmth. It's almost contagious how the author tells the story of his cherished childhood years which are made of happiness. One example is, "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that embrace the two, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." This quote emphasizes the happiness and exhilarating joy of the endless childhood of the house of the authors. Another mood this memoir gives is gratitude and gratitude to the family and home of the authors. For example, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." This quote shows that the author can only thank his loving parents who did everything to ensure a good life. The author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family. A third mood in this memoir is compassion and dedication. This memoir shows that even when moving to a new country with new people, the family still keeps their childhoods filled with the culture of who they are. They don't hide it because of their struggles and hardships or whatever. An example of compassion and dedication is, "in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship." This quote shows that they keep a constant habit of the warmth and apathy of their culture. Nothing stopped them from living as they chose.               

<START>

 

The atmosphere created by the author in the memories is edifying. The mood created by the author is uplifting as it shows that race does not matter when it comes to unity or friendship. It's also lifted because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so their family could live better lives. Another reason he lifts up is that in the story he explains that family doesn't necessarily have to be blood related and can be someone you love and will help you. This is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoirs is improving.

The Native of Cuba arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished studio @ NUM1 old Rawedia maria and @ NUM2 years old @ PERSON1. In 1961 I was born into this simple house, located in a blond brick building in the @ NUM3 family, in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. They showed me their life and these teachings have been the basis of my life. Now he has a good life because he moved to the United States.

The atmosphere in "Narciso Rodriguez" is very warm and calm. There can be a lot of drama in a family, but @ PERSON1 has his background and how much he loves his family and the people in his neighborhood. In paragraph @ NUM1, he says: "In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship." In the first paragraph Narciso @ PERSON1 how he turns around in his culture. I said, "My parents both shared the cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich cooking skills and a love of cooking that still accompanies me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)." Narciso @ PERSON1 love and gratitude in this excerpt, "Narciso Rodriguez".     

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the memoirs is that he was grateful at the beginning of his memoirs. Supporting text proof is the @ NUM1 paragraph stating “(and for which I am eternally grateful.)” The second mood the author created in the memoir is that he was grateful. He was grateful because his parents were immigrants and came to the country without knowing any language or culture. The last mood created by the author in memory was that he felt loved. He felt loved because his parents sacrificed themselves for him. They welcomed a lot of things into Narciso's life. these are three moods that were created by the author in the thesis     

<START>

 

The mood created by the author was a good mood. He is in a good mood because he tells you about his life that he has. He has a good life because he has good, kind parents. He is rich. He has no trouble getting punished. Her parents are rich and they have a good job. The author did a good job of making this story happy and not sad.      

<START>

 

The mood in @ ORGANIZATION1 is displayed as happiness and appreciation. Narciso understands how much his parents gave up for him by moving from Cuba to @ LOCATION1. They were also always by his side and made sure that there were only positive attitudes around him. He appreciates it so much that he ends @ ORGANIZATION1 by saying "I'll never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home". by that he says it was a house that could shelter you, but a house is a place where you want to be with your family, where you feel safe and comfortable. Happiness comes from appreciation because you can't appreciate something and that doesn't make you a little happier. his happiness is also described in the paragraph @ NUM1 where he begins by saying "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice".      

<START>

 

The mood created by author, @ PERSON1, is an upbeat and happy mood. I know this because he states that he is very grateful to his parents for passing on the recipes and cooking skills, as well as the Cuban music they used to listen to. It is the atmosphere that @ PERSON1 creates in the memories. 

<START>

 

The mood in the memories the author tries to get @ CAPS1 is. That it is calm and that in its own way the mood leads to forgiveness and @ CAPS2. Because memories mostly try to tell you that no matter where you go, you never forget your family. And that the memories are much better than the reality you live in. And it doesn't matter how far you decide to go, in a different country. Never forget who gave birth to you. And who loves you. Which really means family. And friends. But the @ CAPS3 they describe in the @ CAPS4. He decides to leave his family to go to America and study. And do something big with his life. And he goes through other things to love, other people think of him as an immigrant. And how the rest of the @ CAPS5 family comes out of it @ CAPS6. But family to them really meant nothing to them. In their house, they have left the door open for any family that needs help or is going through the same thing as their family. So this is the atmosphere that the author is trying to describe to you.

In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author displays a mood.

In the memories "Narciso Rodriguez", by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a specific atmosphere created. The vibe is proud as the author goes on to say how amazing their parents are and how welcoming the house was. In the memoirs it is written: “Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban house, whose very heart was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich cooking skills and love of cooking to me. who is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). " The author recounts how his house was full of Cuban culture and how excellent the Cuban cuisine is.

In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together in great solidarity. and friendship.

That is why the mood created in the memoir is proud.          

<START>

 

The mood of the story is joyful. Everyone spending time with their family, having fun together, celebrating together would give you a happy feeling of what a family is. It's like the family in the story has moved to the United States, they don't know anyone first, they don't have any friends. They live in a one room apartment, but years later they moved to a @ NUM1 room apartment. There lives a family with a baby born above them. the baby is the work of the main character (babysitter) and also the main character's first friend. For the main character, friendships and home are very important to him. If there are no friendships and homes, there will be no love. These taught the main character how to love and how to care for someone. other. The main character said that friendship and home are the basis of his life, he understands without letting his parents teach him. When you have friendship, home, and love, everything will be perfect for you. All you need is the support of your family. You will always be happy and you will feel very lucky to have all of these things.             

<START>

 

The mood the other created was how happy Narciso was because her parents had given up so much that she had a better life and a better education in America.

<START>

 

The @ CAPS1 tries to make the reader understand the feelings of Narciso Rodriguez by describing how much Narciso grew up with little and how difficult it must have been for him to live in this type of environment and house. for example "In 1961, I was born into this simple house, located in a two-family blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey." This quote @ CAPS4 how, even since childhood, Narciso still lived in poor environments and didn't have much at all. The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 the misfortune of the Rodriguez family and how they struggle to make everything better @ CAPS2 the end of the memior the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 the happiness and pride of the family because they are now doing much better than they were before . for example "I will never forget how my parents turned a house into a home". Again, this grid @ CAPS4 how proud they are to live in a much better place and environment, and had to struggle to get to where they are now.

In the memories of Narciso Rodriguez, a non-stalgic mood is created from his memories. The atmosphere is created by his parents and the place where he lives. One of the reasons the mood isn't stalgic is because he's grateful to his parents. “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I have often told them that what they have done is a much braver thing than I ever could have done” (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). By being grateful to his parents, he helps the non-stalgic mood to grow. Plus, where he lives contributes to the ambiance. "And for that, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home those -there "(@ CAPS1 @ NUM2). Since his parents turned his house into a home, he will never forget what they did for him, making this memory more non-stalgic. In the memories of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a non-stalgic atmosphere from memories of his past.        

<START>

 

There are few atmospheres created. They are comfort, Love and sacrifice. Comfort thanks to the way @ PERSON1 described his house, his parents and the families in the neighborhood. Love because his parents loved him and each other very much and they cared about what they did and their family. Sacrifice because his parents sacrificed their heartwarming home to move to @ LOCATION1 for their son. It was difficult for them, but @ ORGANIZATION1 enjoyed it. He loves his parents what they did for him.      

<START>

 

There were many moods defined by @ CAPS1 in memories. one of the moods was happiness. Narciso had a very happy family. They had a lot of friends and were grateful. Another mood that the ensemble @ CAPS1 was proud of. He was so proud to have parents who cared so much and had such selflessness. A third mood in memories is love. Narciso and his family were loved by a lot and they also loved a lot in return. The arms and doors of his parents were open at all times for anyone who needed to get back on their feet. Narciso was grateful to have such a large family (including an extended one). Throughout this memoir there were moods of benevolence, love, gratitude, and happiness. These were the moods @ CAPS1 defined in these memories.           

<START>

 

The mood created by the author was very grateful and outgoing. The person was very grateful to grow up and be able to live at @ LOCATION1. He loved how his parents gave up on everything and were selfless so their kids could live normal lives and do whatever they wanted to do. The parents of the children were very outgoing as they gave up everything they had in their life in Cuba, so that they could give their all they always wanted their children to be in @ LOCATION1. 

<START>

 

In the non-fiction book The @ CAPS1 prints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, he talks about his family and where he lived before being this famous fashion designer. The mood that emerges from this biography is a sad and happy mood. He talks about our family from Cuba and how they came to the United States in 1956. He said that after living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment, he moved into an apartment of three rooms he would call his home. He has many happy memories of his apartment. Alegria was his babysitter and became his first friend. Narciso Rodriguez gives a vibe to the story that is both very uplifting and sad at the same time.    

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy, loving and grateful mood. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mingling with the aromas of the cuisine. It means that there was a fun atmosphere in his house when he was growing up, which makes you happy. “ Growing up in this environment instilled in me the feeling that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. " Here, he talks about the fact that he loves his family, even if it is not a blood relative with them, it makes me amorous mood. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." What he was saying was that he was grateful to his parents for what they had done for him, which makes me grateful to my parents. This is the atmosphere that I felt created by the author in the memories.         

<START>

 

I think the vibe of the story is to be grateful. I think this is because in the story it is said that Narciso thanks his parents for their love and sacrifice. Also because in the story, Narciso says his parents turned a simple house into a house. Which means they were kind and selfless. And he says that "the warmth of the kitchen of his humble home where a Cuban feast always filled the air not only with perfume and music, but also with life and love.  

<START>

 

In this memoir, the atmosphere is very pleasant and brings to mind childhood memories. The reason is that he recounts how his parents guided him to be a willful man, and he couldn't have done it if he hadn't had the conditions he had then. He seems to think that if he hadn't had the parents and the opportunities he had then, his life would have been much different. So the vibe of this poem makes you feel right at home, where your heart is.   

<START>

 

The atmosphere created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in his memoirs is very proud of his parents and happy. "... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not." The author is happy, recalling memories that are neither unhappy nor unpleasant. It's not romantic, lonely, or sad, it's happy, fun, friendly, and fulfilling. "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." Narciso is very grateful to his parents, moving so that @ CAPS1 can have a better life and education than them. @ CAPS1 expresses their gratitude to them very much. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @ CAPS1 writes about how @ CAPS1 told them that what they had done was a braver thing than @ CAPS1 could ever have done, and his admiration for their persistence and strength. @ CAPS1 truly loves and appreciates his parents and everything they have done for him is the main theme of the memoir. The atmosphere @ CAPS2 and created by Narciso Rodriguez is proud and admiring his parents, and very happy.          

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the thesis. First, the vibe of the story is that the author wanted to represent the story of a family that came to @ LOCATION1. Second, the story is nice because the son of the family was born in @ LOCATION1, and the author tried to represent the nationality of a @ CAPS1 that the parents are of another nationality, they know how to live with his son.  

<START>

 

In the story "@ PERSON1", the mood created by the author is loving and peaceful. For example, passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing the aroma of cooking. It shows that the house is peaceful. Another example is, “ My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we consider family. It shows that her family is kind and loving. Finally, I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. They show she loves her parents very much and will always love them. In conclusion, this is the loving and peaceful atmosphere created by the author.     

<START>

 

The mood created by the @ CAPS1 in this memoir is mainly grateful through the memoir. It's so grateful because @ CAPS1 says how grateful he is to have such loving parents who risked sacrificing their jobs, and @ CAPS2 all they had in Cuba to go to the United States where they were. did not know the language, had no money, and for the moment no shelter. I know it's grateful because the @ CAPS1 clearly says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." this brings out the vibe as well as throughout the excerpt the @ CAPS1 talks about his gratitude to his parents. In conclusion, I think the mood surrounding the article is grateful.    

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the memories is affectionate. The mood for memories is affectionate because Narciso's house reminds him of his old country. The author says his grandparents couldn't come to @ LOCATION1 until 1970. Narciso's house was transformed into a house that reminded him of Cuba.  

<START>

 

The mood of the outhor in the memories speaks of the family culture and how I would be in a house with your family friends and its importance and in the story it is said that the parents of Narciso Rodriguez move and how he lives and how these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship And the parents of Narciso Rodriguez olwoys kept their doors open to people they considered a family that they would do the same with us to them. And Narciso Rodriguez would always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice they have for him and he said he will never forget this house he lived in or his gracious neighborhood which was so great for him and them. things he learned with his neighborhood how to love And he said he will never forget how his parents turned his simple house into a home. And that's how it is in Narciso Rodriguez's house with his neighborhood with whom he likes to be  

<START>

 

This memoir definitely has a strong and apparent mood, and that mood stands out to me as Narciso being grateful, he is obviously very grateful to his parents and family. I know this because the memoir says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" This quote really shows that @ PERSON1 is grateful for his parents' love for him. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity that was imprinted on me at such a young age and demonstrating the importance of family and @ CAPS1. " This quote shows how grateful he is for his family, but also how his family shaped him as a person.All in all there are a lot of emotions in this story, but the one @ CAPS2 got me the more shown was his gratitude.  

<START>

 

The author created an atmosphere of immense gratitude. The author knows that not all families (Cuban or possibly @ CAPS1) can come together and be truly happy and grateful for what they have. Not all families can work well with everyone. Not all families can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others. It is a feeling of gratitude because of the parents. Authors consistently praise them for their brave deeds, even going against the law to help those in need.

The author says his parents unwittingly passed on their cooking skills and love. This evidence is found in the second paragraph. Mood is described as cheerful, dizzy, excited and elated. This is because the author begins to understand what it is like to have a "family that is not related by blood but by race and culture. This proof can be found in paragraph @ NUM1. The parents of the perpetrators urged the refugees to stay with them until they got back on their feet. His parents / @ CAPS1 did so whenever they needed something they were doing well. This last piece of evidence is found in paragraph seven. It is evidence that describes the mood of the briefs (and also of where they are).

The mood that Narciso Rodriguez showed in memories was grateful and grateful to his mother and father for their love and sacrifice they suffered when he was growing up. He was very grateful for giving arms to all who needed them and for their warm attitudes and teachings about what family really defines. Narciso learned this definition from his parents, family is or can be anyone important to you, and they don't need to be related by blood like a neighbor with a different culture. He is also very grateful for his parents' selflessness in moving to @ LOCATION1 for his education without even thinking about the job in their head. Narciso's mood is represented in every sentence of this written memoir, he was very lucky to have had such a great childhood and a "family" that he realizes and will be grateful for everything anyone has done. to help him become what he is. now for the rest of his life.

In the memoirs "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author puts a certain mood. I think the mood created in this story is love. My reason for thinking this is because the story is about how parents sacrificed everything to move to @ LOCATION1 so that they could have a better life, just like their children. Another reason love is the mood is because he says that even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood parents, he still considers them family. Finally, I think love is the theme because it shows eternal gratitude to his parents for his wonderful childhood and for making the place he lived to feel like home. That's why I think the mood created by memories is love

The mood is down to a sad feeling. Filled with misery, the author organizes it like this. There is also an atmosphere of love.

He also says they have learned the true definition of family. this is why he is also put in a sadly amorous atmosphere. They were immigrants. This brief is inspiring.

In my opinion, I think the author puts on a loving mood. Here are my points to consider. First of all, he explains how much he loves his parents. An elaboration of my point is that he uses strong words to show that he likes them very much. For example "I have often told them of my admiration for their strength." @ CAPS1 for all he talks about his family and the love they shared. An elaboration of my point is that it explains what courage they had. For example "My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language." @ CAPS2 of everything, he explains how much his house meant to him. He talks about the memories he had there. For example "I will never forget this house ... or the many things I learned there".

I think the mood of the authors is honored, proud, loving and appreciated. I think the author's mood is part of being honored because (in paragraph @ NUM1) he really expressed how he feels about his parents being so loving and making others feel loved and welcomed. I also think he was proud because, he explains (in paragraph @ NUM2) how much he appreciates his family and his parents for having open arms and helping people in need, and having parents if awesome that he doesn't even have much words to express about the commitment and kindness his parents have with everyone. Throughout the story the author always mentions how loving his parent is and you can see in the passage that he chose this trait with the words and phrase he used in the story. to express the fact that his parents love their family and their @ CAPS1. This is what I think are his moods and the reason for them.    

<START>

 

The atmosphere created by the author in the memories is pleasant and calm. He describes how the family lets people come into their homes with open arms and open doors and that makes me and my others seem in a good mood. The atmosphere is calm because she talks about this family doing beautiful things and there is no screaming or fighting and I find it nice and calm.       

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the memories is that every time he talks about his new home his mood changes. For example paragraph @ NUM1 of rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that still accompanies me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today). Whenever there are parentheses, it means the mood of the story changes when he talks about his life in Cuba and the new life here in America. He is grateful to be in America and that his parents left Cuba where they had a better life.    

<START>

 

The ambiance created by Narciso Rodriguez has a feeling of love and benevolence. Since he's talking about his family of course, he's going to like @ CAPS1. For example, he says "Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends". It shows that he misses those moments and he missed them, he really cared about those moments. The atmosphere created in the extract is therefore loving and caring.    

<START>

 

In the memories, the mood created by the author is very understandable and true. Throughout the memoir, the author says how grateful he is to his parents. In the memoirs, Narciso explains, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." Narciso's parents had to go through a lot of difficult things. They had to leave their country, their friends and their family, and they practically had to start their lives over. But her parents withstood these difficult times. They cared and taught Narciso many important things. The atmosphere that the author sets is very affectionate. The author had very amazing parents for whom he is very grateful.

The mood that the author creates in the memories is loving and grateful. Narciso tells the reader how grateful he is. @ CAPS1 is for living at @ LOCATION1, and even though @ CAPS1 might not live in a big, beautiful house, her family is what makes her love her home. @ CAPS1 loves and appreciates what her family has done for her. “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. @ CAPS1 will never forget home because that's where @ CAPS1 learned the true definition of family.” That's where I learned. the true definition of "family". And for that, I will never forget this gracious home or neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.     

<START>

 

In the memoirs, the author goes beyond describing the trip to @ LOCATION1 and the house in which he lived. He gives an in-depth and warm description of his life at @ LOCATION1 and the relationships he has forged. He also spends time talking about his parents' selflessness and what they do to make new immigrants feel welcome in this new place. The author sets the mood that makes people want to read this if they are feeling sad and just want a warm and cozy feeling of it. I think the vibe in all of this gives off a sense of altruism, but also a coming together when all are separated and come together as one. When you turn segregation into unity, good things are inevitable. The authors say this in his memoir: “I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a house. The vibe of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place. If we do like them, we can all live in unity.

In this memoir, the author created an ambience of what it was like in his childhood home. Based on the @ NUM1 pharagraphe, cooking was a big part of the author's childhood life. The author describes a house filled with the smell of cooking and "passionate music @ CAPS1". @ CAPS2 a warm atmosphere reminiscent of home, this pharagraphe is the basis of the authors' childhood. The author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants who were friendly and always helping each other. In the pharagraphe @ NUM2, the author describes an atmosphere of family, friendship and acceptance. Although the locals were not all the same, they are mutually exclusive in an era of racism and segregation. Coming to another country and starting a new life can be extremely difficult. It's hard to get good jobs when you've just immigrated and might not have a lot of money. It is also difficult to get used to climate change and learn another language. It creates an atmosphere of hardship and difficult times. Throughout this thesis, the author creates atmospheres, whether good or bad, memories of his childhood.

The atmosphere created by the author is joyful. A sense of security with friends, families and neighbors. Her parents sacrificed their careers and left friends and family behind, essentially starting their lives over for the benefit of their children. Where Narciso lived, there was a beautiful blond brick building for two families. There she learned about Cuban culture like cooking and the music that filtered through the house when she was a child. Narciso had tons of "families". Not necessarily related by blood, their neighbors were mostly immigrants and when all these cultures came together there was great solidarity and friendship. She lived in a nearby community where a helping hand was always there when needed. Her parents always kept their arms and door open. Alegria, the daughter of their landlords, came to their kitchen most often. Bertha and also aunts Juanita and her cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary. Often, someone would stay with them temporarily. Even in difficult times, her parents sacrificed anything for her. And for that, Narciso is grateful. Grateful to her parents for making a home into a home.

In the memories of Narciso Rodriguez, the author created a very grateful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly tells us how much he still loves it today. "Passionate Cuban music (which I still loved today) filled the air ..." (@ CAPS1. @ NUM1). Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his house as a child, he included the parenthesis to remind us that he still loves the music he listened to. It makes him very grateful that his parents played this music at his house. In addition to giving us reason to believe that he is grateful, he tells us in his memoirs that he constantly thanks his parents. "I thanked them several times." (@ CAPS1. @ NUM2). He clearly tells us that he thanks his parents, and that he is very grateful for what they did for him as a child. Finally, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."

The mood created by the author in the memoir is Happiness and Greatness Here are my three reasons why I think First of all, Narciso is proud of the way @ CAPS2 lives and who @ CAPS2 is. It all started, starting with his parents, they are immigrants. "In 1961, I was born into this simple house." @ CAPS1 of all, @ CAPS2 cherished every moment lived by @ CAPS2. @ CAPS2 is grateful for everything his parents have done for him and for everyone else. "my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family." Eventually, his parents emigrated from Cuba. They are known as immagrents because they weren't born in America, and Narciso is proud and honestly happy for them. This is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and greatness.

In the brief there were actually two main moods. The first mood and the most important mood were joy and happiness. Because through memories, the reader discovers the family of writers and how much the writer was for his family. An example of this is when the writer wrote, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, for although the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader should always remember that it is a memoir. This means that it was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. That is why sadness is also a mood in this memoir. Ultimately, the happy mood sort of covers up the depressing mood, but to really get a feel for where the writer is coming from, the reader considers both of these moods the most.

Narciso Rodriguez created a caring and grateful vibe throughout the brief. He did this @ CAPS1 without ever guarding himself, but always thanking his parents and talking about his childhood in a way that everyone helped each other. For example in @ CAPS2 @ NUM1 he talks about the sacrifices his parents made to give their children a better life. He says, “They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if that meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Nordic winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. » @ CAPS1 writing about the hardships and sacrifices that others (in his case, his parents) had to go through and do in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows appreciation for them which then gives the reader a feeling of gratitude. Also, in @ CAPS2 @ NUM2 he describes how his neighborhood was like family. He said: “Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great feeling that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. On the contrary, our neighborhood was mostly made up of people. 'Spanish immigrants, Cuban and Italian at a time. when overt racism was the norm and segregation reigned in the United States. in a neighborhood, despite customs Moreover, all these cultures came together in solidarity and friendship. This @ CAPS2 gave me an idea of how, in times of struggle, people come together and help each other move forward. So it gives the reader a feeling of benevolence. Narciso Rodriguez produces an atmosphere of benevolence and greatness throughout. throughout his memoirs.

In the @ NUM2 paragraph, the author talks about unity and friendship in his neighborhood despite racial differences. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table at paragraph @ NUM3. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @ NUM4.

In the memoirs "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is calm and they are happy. I think this is because they mostly talk about the good thing in their childhood. They also say how much they loved their family. If you don't love or don't have a family as a child, you wouldn't be happy and they were. My last reason is that they were so thankful for their home and the way their parents made a home into a home. This is why I think the mood of the authors is happy and calm.

Here, Rodriguez explains that she never ate real grandparents @ CAPS2 until they left Cuba in 1970.

Their simple house was the best place to meet with family. "The warmth of cooking in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air not only with perfume and music, but also with life and love". This memoir made me connect this family to mine how similar they are. Without love, it is not a family, that is why at the end of the word "family" the i, l, y means "I love you".

The atmosphere is a mixture of things, it's really hard to tell with all the emotions that the author gives off. But the strongest feeling, however, is unity and family. I'm not sure family can be called an emotion, but I think it's something that can be described by many. One of course is unity, or as he says, "great solidarity and friendship", it's kinda nice how he characterizes family as something like the bonds you make with people as opposed to other cultures where the family is born out of blood and the family is always the first. So in a way, I think his way of thinking comes from his culture. But he also puts on a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely grateful for what he has. As they say "happiness is nothing without appreciating it" and as he says "I learned the true definition of family" so apparently he knows true happiness

The old quote was found in the @ NUM1 paragraph describing the pride and gratitude of the house in which the author lived. Memories have created a family love that every person longs for in life. “They came selflessly, like many immigrants, to give their children a better life” (@ NUM3). Anyone who can sacrifice themselves in this way for the better life of their family is a good person. It is family love that I describe as being selfless and loving other members of your family. Another mood created in memories was pride in family sacrifice. “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I often told them that what they had done was a braver thing than I ever could have done” (@ NUM4). It was a quote from paragraph @ NUM4.

The mood created by this memoir is a kind of relaxed and benevolent mood. Several parts of this book emphasize this state of mind.

One more thing that helps with the vibe is the way he describes how everyone in his neighborhood was kind to each other.

Within the walls of Narciso, his young parents created there the traditional house @ CAPS1, There, the heart was cooking. Narciso's parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich cooking skills to Narciso, who she loves to cook. Quite the narciso country neighborhood was made up mostly of Italian immigrants from Spain during a racist era. his parents came selflessly, as some immigrants will, to give their children a better life. They sacrificed their family, their friends and their careers. In the county where they came from, I think her memory is pleasant and happy, because with these memories, she knows what her family went through.

The mood created by the author was the love of his family The author describes "a love of (Cuban) cuisine that is still with me (the author) today" and how "passionate Cuban music that I (the author) still adore it today ". The author takes this love from his parents. Another way the author created the atmosphere of love was to talk about how his "parents always kept their arms and the door open." I know it takes a lot to be able to let anyone into your house. The authors speak with great love at this point in the story. The author also says that he "will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice". It also sets the mood for the story as they are about a romantic relationship. The mood that the author set during the story was love. I think that was a really good mood to put in a story.

I think the mood the author created was gratitude to his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they have done for him. In these memoirs, Narciso Rodriguez says that "I have often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I have thanked them on several occasions." I think in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand what he thinks of his family. He wants to tell us about what they did for him. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think that in telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratitude to the parents who made him a “home”.

I think this is because he describes his parents as selfless and takes everyone to their little apartment. I also think he creates "war" by saying that his first birthday with his parents is heartwarming. This is the @ CAPS1 that I believe the @ CAPS3 is trying to create.

I have often told them that what they did was a much braver thing than I could ever have been able to.

The memoir goes back to his childhood, fondly, so I would call the wheezy mood. Yes, the author creates a whistling vibe, talking about his childhood home, friends and family. But ... the hissing only lasts until the end of the @ NUM1 paragraph ... after that he gets in a good mood, where he thanks and describes what his parents went through. If it's possible to have two moods, then this brief does. The moods are both hissing and grateful. Yes.

The mood of the author and the memoir is formidable. The author is very grateful to his parents. He is grateful to his parents because they gave their lives for him.

the mood that the author created in the memories was so sad and happy and they were interested. I think this brief is good and I liked the title of Narciso Rodriguez. 

<START>

 

The mood created by the author is both @ CAPS1 and love. At first, the mood created by the author was @ CAPS1. In paragraph @ NUM1 it says "They struggled both personally and financially." Narciso explains the tragedies his parents had to face in order for him to live at @ LOCATION1. So by reading the excerpt based on poverty and the struggles their family faces, you are making @ CAPS1 grow for them. I also chose love. In the excerpt it is stated. “It was here that I learned the true definition of 'family.' And for that, I will never forget this gracious home or neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. " @ CAPS3 the extract the author explains the love he has learned to form for the" family "@ CAPS3 the neighborhood. This is why I think love is another mood created by the author. These are the reasons why I chose both @ CAPS1 and the love for the moods created by the author from the excerpt.          

<START>

 

In this memoir, the mood was created Narciso and his family. @ PERSON2 family, set the mood by bringing the whole family together in their old home in Cuba and their new home at @ LOCATION1. @ PERSON2 brought the vibe is this memory by loving his family and telling them every day that he is grateful for everything they did for him as a kid when he was growing up .

The mood created by the author in the memoirs can be described in several ways. The atmosphere created by the author was confusing. It's confusing because I see more than once too many. Some of them are joy, pride, sadness and others. It is because the memories speak of the life of Narciso Rodriguez. The mood created by the author cannot be described because there are too many of them.     

<START>

 

The author creates a @ CAPS1 but happy mood and shows parts @ CAPS1 and happy parts in @ CAPS2 about a boy whose parents immigrated. it was in his house that he grew up and his parents put a Cuban touch there. 

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in the memories is happiness because in almost all the paragraphs he talks about how much he loves his parents and his Cuban culture. Narciso tells how his parents made his everyday home a home. That's why I think Narciso is happy in this memory. In paragraph @ NUM1, it is written "Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, whose very heart was my kitchen."   

<START>

 

The author is very happy and satisfied with the family he has and wishes his family did. The author appreciates what his parents did to other relatives who immigrated from Cuba. He dedicates what he learned such as cooking, good manners and friendship to his parents. The author " admires strength and perseverance and has thanked them many times ". overall the author couldn't have a better family than this, they showed them how to live and this is what a family should accomplish.

In this memoir, he talks about the true meaning of selflessness and a home. At the beginning of this memoir, they tell how their parents experienced the difficulties of a lifetime. And invite people to their homes until they get back on their feet. It took at least five years before parents could afford a decent-sized house. Even though his parents left Cuba, they still made an effort to keep all of their Cuban traditions alive. Her parents loved to cook and taught Narciso how to do it. They also play traditional Cuban music. In addition, they taught him to be selfless. They would invite people even if they weren't of the same race because they didn't care.       

<START>

 

The mood created in this memoir is love and unity. (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) "... all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship." It meant that they were close, loving and united. This memoir gave me the feeling that a house is not a house until there is love. "Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mingling with the aromas of the cuisine." It also gives me the feeling of warmth and love.     

<START>

 

In my opinion, the mood is created by the author in the memoir by the setting and describing her childhood, where she was born and why her parents came here. The reason I think it's because the mood can create that frame, because the mood is the feeling in the story, like sad, happy, lonely, silent and that's what creates the frame who is where, when and time of the story. Here are a few examples from the excerpt : “ In 1961, I was born into this simple house, located in a two-family building, in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. " In addition," grow in this environment instilled in me a great feeling that the " family " had nothing to do with being a blood relative. » Author The very grateful to his Cuban heritage and his house is about relationships and space.

I particularly appreciated this brief. The author has done a fantastic job of creating a sense of love and comfort while telling her story. The first sentence that struck me was in paragraph @ NUM1: " Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air, mingling with the aromas of the kitchen." For me, that phrase was about making people feel comfortable and at home. He put a sense of family into the story. The feeling of love was easily put into the story in paragraph @ NUM2, when the author spoke about his family. Especially where the author said "My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. The family loved everyone and used their family. love to help people in difficulty, or people who just wanted to visit, get back on their feet and stay in their homes. This story was really filled with dozens of examples of love and comfort, and I really enjoyed it. read it.

The vibe is that of a family who have tried to leave their home country to start a new life in a new country.

<START>

 

The mood that the author created in this memoir was very proud. I could tell the vibe was like this because he was always talking about his parents and how they had given up so much to come here. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1 it is written : "My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture ... To give their children a better life, even if that meant leaving behind family, friends and careers in the country they loved. " I could @ CAPS1 feel proud because he talks about how his parents left everything for him. Additionally, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to those in need of help, even though they were the wealthiest people. He gave many examples throughout the brief which strongly showed the mood he created in this brief, the pride      

<START>

 

The @ CAPS1 creates an atmosphere of happiness in the @ CAPS2. He recounts memories of his child that made him happy. He talks about the love he had for cooking with his parents. He also mentions the music as being passionate and that he still adores it to this day. He also describes how good his neighborhood was and what a tight-knit community it was. Then he begins to explain that a large part of his family was not only related to blood, but included other people. He then explained that his parents were very sacrificed people. So it was a very good mood in which @ CAPS1 wrote the @ CAPS2.

It was an important part of turning this house into a home and, therefore, part of the vibe that Rodriguez wanted to portray. "... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home ... love of cooking ... passionate Cuban music ..." (Rodriguez, @ NUM1). I could also sense a sense of oneness that the author was trying to portray. " .. the congregation of family and friends ... " The author repeatedly mentions that he and his parents always let distant relatives stay at home, and that many friends and family came to dine with him. them. The author even describes his community as a "... a tight-knit community ..." (Rodriguez, @ NUM2). Finally, a feeling of gratitude runs along the backbone of this piece. The author notes that his parents played an important role in his life, exposing him to his culture, his family and friends, as well as at home. He doesn't even have to write down how grateful he is, it's so obvious. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." (Rodriguez, @ NUM3).

I feel that the mood (s) created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud and grateful. I think the author makes memories happy because he says his parents were nice and they worked hard and that made him happy I think. Another mood, I think, was that he was proud. He said (in paragraph @ NUM1) that growing up in his environment was a great sense of family. His family welcomed other refugees from Cuba to celebrate their arrival in that country. Through what he grew up in, he learned the true definition of family. The last mood I think the author created was that he was grateful. He said in paragraph @ NUM2 that "I will always be grateful for the love and sacrifice of my parents. He is thankful to his parents and the way they" turned a simple house into a house "(paragraph @ NUM3) This is what I feel in the mood (s) are remembered are.

In the memories "@ PERSON1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives", by Narciso Rodriguez, he creates an atmosphere for the readers. The mood or feeling created in the story is primarily love. There are many things said in the memories that express the mood of love. For example, in the second paragraph, the author talks about the simple apartment he and his parents lived in as a great place. He does this because he is very grateful to his parents because he loves them. The paragraph says: "and unwittingly imparted to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that still accompanies me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)." @ CAPS1 @ MONTH1 people are not thankful for simple things like cooking, but the Narciso loves his parents so much that he is extremely happy even for the little things they have done for him. Instead of calling Sergio and Edelmira the neighbors who lived below us, they are called surrogate grandparents. It shows that they were much loved by Narciso. The @ NUM1 paragraph says "Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily." It expresses the mood of love because once again the neighbors are called family. In addition, Narciso's parents allowed them to live with them because they love them and care about them deeply.

There is an atmosphere created by the author in the thesis. One way to set the mood is to explain how the warm life in the narrator's house was created. "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompass both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) It helps set the mood for the memoir as it explains how the narrator grew up. Another way to set the mood is to show how caring and selfless the narrator's parents are. "I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a house." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2) It gave the brief a light and happy mood.

In the story I just read, "Narciso Rodriguez", I think the vibe that the author gives would be passionate, grateful and happy. The reason I think the author is passionate is because he talks about how a house isn't just a roof over your head, that's where your heart is. "My parents have always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they consider family." I think it's passionate because to do these things you have to be really caring and lovable. I think the author is showing greatness because he says he always thanks his parents for the sacrifices they made to give him a better life at @ LOCATION1. Even if he says it a few times, it's not good enough to prove how grateful he is. His parents transformed a three bedroom apartment into a place he now calls home and that is why he is grateful. I think Narciso is happy to have had the chance to spend his childhood growing up life at @ LOCATION1, but continues to take on Cuba's cultural tradition. He is now a fashion designer. Overall, these are the three moods that I think Narciso gives in the story.

Another example of love is when @ PERSON1 says in paragraph @ NUM1, "they came selflessly, as do many immigrants, to give their children a better life." The brief also makes them very grateful for what they have, which is another mood. He does this by asking the author to point out how small his house was and how his parents did all they could to give them a better life. It really makes you look back and see what their parents have done for them.

The @ CAPS1 created by the author in the thesis is very necessary. I say this because I don't like writing that doesn't have @ CAPS1 swings. this author shows well the emotions of Narciso Rodriguez in his story. One place in history where I really love @ CAPS1 swing is between @ CAPS2 @ NUM1 and @ NUM2. I like this change because, it goes from talking about an owner and his daughter to talking about the parents of @ ORGANIZATION2. I like this because it creates a different @ NUM3 backgrounds mode on the two different @ CAPS3 of People. He recounts how @ PERSON1's parents were immigrants and weren't brought up well, but they wanted their son to have a better childhood life than them. On the other hand, the owner and his daughter @ LOCATION1, were wealthy and could do whatever they wanted. I'm just blown away by how this author changes his moods.

The mood created by the author in the thesis is very strong. Narciso's mood is mostly linked to his family, friends and most of all his culture. Narciso is very happy and lucky to be born in the United States and to have the chance to grow up there. Second Narciso loves his house. He tells how they transformed their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example, he says cooking is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him to cook, for which he is grateful. Finally, his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them his family. For example, his owner's daughter most often prepared meals for him. Also his "real" grandparents who were not his real grandparents because they were still in Cuba. These are the reasons that create the mood of the authors in the memories.

In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. It means he says he will always love his parents and family. The @ CAPS1 tries to say he is better to have family than money because in this memoir it is about his parents leaving Cuba without money or work, but for them being together gave them hope and now they live in a house with a room @ NUM1 with their family. Without family life would be much more difficult to cope. 

<START>

 

I believe that the mood of the memoir is happy and enlightening. I think this is because @ CAPS1 someone is immigrating from a certain country of poverty or unjust laws that this community or neighborhood will welcome you to. the family, for the children In conclusion, the atmosphere of this memoir is happy because it is an informative and welcome place. 

<START>

 

The mood of the author of this memoir is extremely grateful and appreciative. He said he would always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices, and mentions the difficulties they had, starting in a one-room apartment and then allowing themselves to move into a three-room apartment for that he calls home. He explains how his parents started their life entirely over at @ LOCATION1 and had to take whatever work they could find. They were able to endure their difficult times with the faith that this struggle would help them and their children move into better times. The author had so much admiration for the strength and perseverance of his parents. He learned the true meaning of " family " and how to love. He was truly grateful for all he had, and the lessons of generosity and the importance of family and friends that his courageous parents had taught him, which had also become the basis of his life.

In the memoirs "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a family atmosphere. Rodriguez talks about how the family always visits. The memoirs state that "countless extended family members came and went ..." (paragraph @ NUM1). He also explains that family is not always the people who are related to you. Rodriguez says that his neighborhood “came together in great solidarity ...” (paragraph @ NUM1). Rodriguez says he is very grateful to his parents "for their love and sacrifice" (paragraph @ NUM3). Narciso Rodriguez truly creates an atmosphere filled with love, caring and family.      

<START>

 

In the @ CAPS1 of "Home : The Blueprints of our lives", @ PERSON2 creates a very distinct atmosphere. I think the vibe at @ CAPS1 is warm, caring, heartwarming and very loving. The author's house is very family-oriented, but not just blood family. His neighborhood was all family when “racism was the norm and segregation reigned”. When Narciso Rodriguez describes this, the @ CAPS1 seems heartwarming and loving. He @ CAPS2 "My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." It brings a feeling of joy and lightness to the article and also comfort. When Rodriguez @ CAPS2 "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" the mood changes a bit. Now, it's admiring, grateful, and compassionate. As Narciso Rodriguez describes his parents' struggle to grow @ CAPS4 better than them, you can feel very grateful and loving. The mood is happy, loving and compassionate at this point This is the mood created by @ CAPS1 by @ PERSON2 from "Home: The blueprints of our lives"          

<START>

 

In the memories, the author sets up a good mood while remembering his childhood home. It tells only good things and happy memories throughout the memory. He also talks about cherished childhood memories and the quality of his community and his parents.  

<START>

 

The mood in the story is very happy. The author thinks about all the good times he had growing up. He tells how he had such a good life in the house. How his parents got there as immigrants and made their living, then him. Another reason he's in a good mood is to talk about his family coming to @ LOCATION1. He tells how his parents taught him to cook. He thanked his parents because he was so happy that they created a family and not just a home.      

<START>

 

And throughout the memoir there is a constant mood, which is happiness. At the beginning of the memoir, @ PERSON1 describes her house, how it started to become a wonderful "house". He said he had "passionate Cuban music" and "amazing cooking aromas". Then in paragraph @ NUM1, @ PERSON1 says that "he loves his parents for their love and their sacrifice" ; and he continues to say how grateful he is to them. Finally, in paragraph @ NUM2, he says: "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a house". It is the state of mind expressed in the brief.       

<START>

 

In the thesis, the author creates many atmospheres. In the text the first vibe he created was benevolence because in paragraph @ NUM1 it says "countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily. until they could get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. " It shows care because they would leave anyone who was family and not care. The next mood he showed was to be thankful because in the @ NUM2 paragraph he said "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice". It is he who shows that he is grateful because he says it in the sentence and he also says the reason why he is grateful to them. These are the atmospheres that memories have created.     

<START>

 

I think in my opion is that the author was very comfortable with his words and his way of being human. His parents were originally from Cuba, @ CAPS1 was in his culture friendly with others around him. For example @ CAPS2 let's say It is in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival in the country and where I celebrated his first birthday.  

<START>

 

The author creates a mood like the other in this memoir. He creates an atmosphere that inspires @ CAPS1 and praises his parents. He tries to express his @ CAPS1 to his parents in words but can't because of all the good times. He creates an atmosphere of happiness that will last forever in his memories and the Kitchen.   

<START>

 

I think the vibe of this story is warm and loving. Narciso's parents never had a big house in the United States, but they turned a small house into a house. In a room @ NUM1, two family houses of the parents of @ LOCATION1 have created a traditional Cuban house. A lot of cooking has taken place in the house. The family was still there, which must have been fun, and it all happened with Cuban music playing in the background. "@ CAPS1 the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Narciso makes his house feel like a very loving house.    

<START>

 

The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 in the story is happy This is because he had to move to @ LOCATION1 and be born for a better life. He also loved growing up listening to Cuban traditions and music as stated in paragraph @ NUM1 "And for what I am forever grateful for", which I adore to this day. 

<START>

 

In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he named the music that was playing and the whole family that ate with them. Narciso also spoke of them cooking. I think the moods are peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. he only speaks the good of them. The mood could also be grateful as he was grateful for a lot of the things his parents had done for him, like conveying the love of cooking. He is also grateful to his parents who left Cuba and @ CAPS1 again @ CAPS2 so he can have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood may be heat because Narciso loved his family and probably felt everyone's warmth when they all passed by his house.      

<START>

 

The mood @ CAPS1 created in memories was gratitude to his parents. In the brief, @ CAPS1 thanks his parents for raising him the way they did. In the article, he thanks them by saying things like "my admiration", "my gratitude" and "generosity". all of these statements are true and they reflect his mood towards his family. In conclusion, the mood was a lot, but I chose gratitude because it reflects what he feels most for his family.  

<START>

 

Narciso @ PERSON1 so proud to be a Cuban immigrant and how his parents have done so much for him. he realized that (in paragraph @ NUM1) family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. And how all cultures came together as great solidarity and friendship doubt when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in United @ ORGANIZATION1. He learned the true meaning of family. How his parents turned an ordinary house into a house he loved. He was grateful for how his parents made so many sacrifices that turned something into a lifelong expense that he will never forget.

I think the mood is supposed to be sad for a lot of reasons. One of the reasons is that he keeps saying his house is not a home until the end.

These quotes @ CAPS2 that friendliness and helpfulness to people around you considered family is a big part of their life and the author tries to convey that sense or mood to the reader. The atmosphere is grateful because @ CAPS1 appreciates everything his parents have done for him. In paragraphs @ NUM3 and @ DATE1, the author mentions being grateful for the cooking skills passed down to him and "to his parents for their love and sacrifice".

Finally, the atmosphere is one of benevolence and a welcome to friends and neighbors whom they considered to be family. At paragraph @ NUM2, the memoir states that "Alegria" and the author's "surrogate grandparents", "graced our kitchen table for meals most of the time."

The Rodriguez have also persevered through the @ CAPS1 challenges of racism and segregation here in this country. In paragraph @ NUM2, he states, "in a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed ..." @ CAPS1, Narciso's parents had to overcome issues with people, and they also had to struggle with mental challenges, due to racism. Finally, in paragraph @ NUM1, Narciso says his parents "always braved the harsh winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships." Her parents had the courage to persevere despite the new weather conditions and financial difficulties. The general mood that Narciso Rodriguez created for me was bravery and perseverance.

A sense of community, altruism and contentment pervades the memories of Narciso Rodriguez on his first home. Happiness was predominant in this story, described through a "love of cooking", "endless celebrations" and "friendship". Readers can imagine the scenes depicted, the happy gatherings around a table laden with aromatic food, and the parties with people, young and old, large and small, from all different cultures. The words that weave this well-written brief are nothing if not content. Community is also emphasized in this written work. "A tight-knit community of honest and hard-working immigrants," has been described as their neighborhood. The memory of many souls working together despite radical racism at that time really gives the memories a sense of community. Narciso Rodriguez says, “My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we considered our family, knowing that they would do the same for us.” When the sacrifices his parents made were described in the memoirs, selflessness truly becomes a mood in the memories. A whole new life embraced just so their kids could have a better life, her parents rarely did things for their own sake. “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,” said Narciso Rodriguez. The endless struggles they endured, and the many times they could have given op, they didn't, because they so selflessly wanted to give Narciso a better life. The mood of this memoir contains three important things: love of community, happiness, and selflessness.

Passionate Cuban music (which I still love it today) ... "This quote shows that the mood was happy and calm. The mood the author created was family friendliness and family friendship and how other people would join them in his family home.

The atmosphere created by the author is that of the American dream. It's a very happy and successful theme with roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants who hopefully had similar stories. In each paragraph there are lines that have to do with my friend being family and how his house was physically quantum but emotionally it was a place of love. This reinforces the mood of happiness in the story. Also the fact that in history racism and segregation were put aside and neighbors were relatives because of whom they were not where they came from. This is what everyone loves to hear and gives hope that the whole nation will do so. finally, the story tells how parents sacrifice their sons for a better life. It probably hit most of the readers close to us, so the mood would now get very serious. This short memoir is a great story to turn you from sad to optimistic and grateful to live in a place you can call home.

The mood created by the author in the memories is happy and loving. One reason I think it's talking about how he and his neighbors (of different descent) all got along very well in solidarity with each other, which creates a feeling of love. Plus, when he talks about happy times, like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen, they are having fun, laughing, and listening to Cuban music. Finally, when he and his family welcome family or even very close friends whom they consider to be family, it conveys a real feeling of happiness, peace and love.

The mood in "Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives" is compassion. Throughout the memoir, he explains how grateful Narciso was to his parents for their "love and sacrifice."

He learned about the generosity and importance of family and friends from his parents and they were "the basis" of his life. Her home welcomed everyone and the air was always filled with " not just perfume and music, but life and love." He has learned what the family really thinks and has grown to love. mother and father had come to this country with so much courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if that meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in the country they love ... Faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times pushed them to endure these difficult times. This is why I think the mood in the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives" is compassion.

In the memoirs, "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, the story has more of a "happy" or "joyous" vibe.

In this memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood. I believe the mood is meant to be viewed as cheerful and uplifting. The whole memoir describes what a rich childhood the author had, from his home even to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When he talks about his house, he says "Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, whose very heart was the kitchen. My parents both shared the cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their responsibilities to me. rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that remains with me today (and for which I am outwardly grateful).

In the memoir written by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso shows a certain love and passion towards his family and his culture. The mood of this memoir would be love and passion because of the words and the emphasis on his feelings. For example, in paragraph three it says that family does not only mean blood ties. @ CAPS1 explained how all kinds of cultures have come together and have always been good friends along the way. Another way to express the mood is through its foreshadowing, showing that @ CAPS1 has kept the tradition going. "My parents both shared cooking tasks and unwittingly passed on to me their rich cooking skills and love of cooking that still accompany me today" and "Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) ) ... "@ CAPS1 expresses its prefiguration in two ways, by adding parentheses and simply stating it. A third example of the vibe in this memoir is how @ CAPS1 spoke about love for his family and the importance of being grateful. "I always told them that what they were doing was a much braver thing than I ever could have done." Narciso also states that @ CAPS1 will never thank his parents enough, and if they taught him any of this @ CAPS1 would not be who is @ CAPS1 as a person today. "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." Just adding love and culture to your home can turn it into a caring home!

Narciso was very grateful to his parents, they had love, happiness, depression and maybe more. The author's memories were sad, but also fond memories. "In 1961, I was born in this simple house, within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban house." Narciso loved his parents for turning a simple house into a traditional Cuban house. He also loved the way his parents made their own house. "My mother and father must have come to this country with such courage, they came selflessly like many immigrants do, to give their children a better life." Narciso was so grateful that he thanks his parents every day for creating love. "It is in this very simple house that my parents celebrate my first birthday".

In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writings about his childhood home. Here is what is. A lot of people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when they live here because, as Narciso says at the bottom of the paragraph @ NUM1, “In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lives over again. entirely, taking whatever work they can find. " @ CAPS1 to talk about the difficulties, Narciso focused on the fact that he was brought up in a wonderful cultural environment. An environment filled with his "family". When he says family, he's not just talking about his biological family. He means all the people with whom he spends time and with whom he has a deep connection. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez conveys in this memoir is a warm, grateful and joyful tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget everything his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous and quite possibly quite wealthy fashion designer, he will never forget how his parents "turned the simple house into a house".

The mood in memories comes alive throughout history. The first is that at first Narciso wasn't sure he would like to move to @ LOCATION1 because it was so different. But that changed when they started having families and using their imaginations to decorate their homes. Then the mood changes amid the memories when they realize that you can just have a good life at @ LOCATION1 when you can anywhere else. Also, having family with them while they were at @ LOCATION1 made their mood more positive. Finally, the family mood was negative when they had to move to @ LOCATION1, but once they were there and made their home a home, the mood immediately changed and they were happy to @ LOCATION2. This is the mood created by the author in the thesis.

In his neighborhood, Narciso says that "cultures came together" and his parents "always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." I can say how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes his house was filled "not just with perfume and music, but with life and love". I believe the ambiance of his home was not only evident to Narciso, but also to his neighbors and his family.

Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful vibe from start to finish in his memior. First of all, he describes the selflessness of his parents. Narciso explains that "they had to start their lives over again". (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States. He understands that they are only left for him, and he appreciates that. Additionally, Narciso is grateful that although his parents moved to the United States, they have retained their Cuban traditions. In Narciso's three-room apartment, "passionate Cuban music ... filled the air, mingling with the aromas of the kitchen" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2). Finally, Narciso expresses his appreciation and strengthens the mood by defining what a house is. He says he "will never forget how [his] parents turned a simple house into a house" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM3). For these, Narciso is grateful and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting and grateful atmosphere.

The author created a warm and loving atmosphere throughout the memoir. "Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air, mingling with the aromas of the cuisine. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, ... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. " (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). This quote represents a warm mood as he talks about what he loves like Cuban music and how friendship and family really come together to form his life as he grows up. "It was a tight-knit community of honest and hard-working immigrants who reached out to people who, while not necessarily of their kind, were clearly in need." This quote clearly represents a loving mood throughout the memoir because, like the first quote, it represents friendship and family. but also represents the love and care among all members of his childhood community, showing the reader that the community cares about each other and that they all love each other. The mood also changed towards the end. It became totally love and warmth, but also happiness. "It was a simple house where my parents took in other refugees to celebrate their arrival" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2) it shows happiness because even if they are poor when they arrive at @ LOCATION1, they always celebrate the possibilities that introduce themselves to them.

In the memories of Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct atmosphere of family and caring is defined. The first way this vibe is defined is passionate Cuban music and home-cooked food. Rodriguez writes: "Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the cuisine". (p. @ NUM1). This quote exalts the family atmosphere as the music and food of their nationality provide a feeling of coziness. Comfort with your family and family atmosphere. Another way to describe the family atmosphere is the size of the house. Rodriguez writes "... I was born in this simple house located in a two-family building in blond bricks ..." (p. @ NUM2). It adds to the family vibe, as living in a tiny house means you'll be spending a lot of time with the family. It also adds a feeling of coziness to the surroundings. Finally, the family atmosphere is influenced by the proximity of their family life. Rodriguez wrote: "My aunts Juanita and Bertha and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live near" (p @ NUM2.). The family living nearby contributes to the mood of the family as it increases the number of family members which lowers the mood of the family. Based on the memories of Narciso Rodriguez, a strong family spirit is expressed.

The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It's happy because she said that growing up in this environment gave me a great feeling that "family" has nothing to do with being a blood relative.

The author of this memoir creates a very calm atmosphere. This article is not at all fascinating. All he does is explain this child's life. This brief, to me, was like taking a list of things and putting them into a complete document. The author didn't create any kind of mood that interested me to keep reading on this topic. This memoir, however, expresses many feelings. It expressed how grateful this child was to his parents and his Cuban origin. Although this memoir has a calm (and slightly boring) mood, the author's ability to reveal information was very deep and insightful.       

<START>

 

one mood in this memory was that of a traditional Cuban house. In the memoir, paragraph @ NUM1, "My parents both shared cooking tasks and unwittingly passed on to me their rich cooking skills and a love of cooking that still accompanies me today (and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air, mingling with the aromas of the cuisine. " A second mood of this memoir was the impression of a Cuban family who faced my hardships. In the memoir, paragraph @ NUM2 "They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Nordic winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships." The last mood makes me feel like a real family: love, loyalty and friendship. In the memoirs, paragraph @ NUM3 "It was here that I learned the true definition of" family. "And for that, I will never forget this house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there on how to love.I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.     

<START>

 

The mood of the author in the memories is touching because I feel like a story of memory. This story tells you how to memorize the story and makes you cry a little. I like it a little because it is about the Cuban people. I think my father knows the people of Cuba and I think he knows their culture.

The atmosphere of @ CAPS1 is joyful. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez describes the happy and fun times of life in his tiny New Jersey home. He describes how his family, consisting of his mother and father, transformed their home @ CAPS2 into a Cuban home and opened the doors to other refugees who were going through difficult times. In the latest @ CAPS4, Narciso explains that this is the house where all of his first birthdays were held and where his friends and family used to gather. The message @ CAPS1 was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter the size or price of a house, it doesn't matter who is in the house, which makes it a special place. The reason I know the vibe @ CAPS3 was happy is because she had some wonderful people in her life. Her house was neither big nor fancy, but as described in @ CAPS4 @ NUM1 "It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees." In this @ CAPS5, he says his house was full of happiness and love. Narciso's once simple house had become a home, filled with friends and family.        

<START>

 

In the memories, I think the mood created by the author is love for the family. In paragraph @ ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a "blood" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to think of them as family. At paragraph @ NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and are always treated with love. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought so many people to their home is inspiring because it really shows the love and warmth that the family has to bring to refugees from other countries besides America, as well as their families!    

<START>

 

In the memories, the atmosphere created by @ CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez is welcoming and joyful. An example that describes this is taken from paragraph @ NUM1. It is here that he described his neighborhood by saying: “In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship. @ CAPS1 this meant that whatever the origin of their neighbors, they always welcomed each other. Also, in paragraph @ NUM2, the author says that his parents came to @ LOCATION1 selflessly, to enable their child to have a better life even if they left their home country. Finally, in paragraph @ NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memory of his home, where he had birthdays, holidays and family. He said there was a scent of life and love in the air. For this he is eternally grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of the word "family".

The mood of the memory is nostalgic and happy. He tells readers about his economic background. He also explains his family and what they meant to him. then he talks about his house and how he celebrated his birthday there. These are a few examples of how they set the mood.

The mood in this story is very happy. In this answer, I will show how he created it. First, the author has always been in a good mood, no matter what happened or what his parents didn't do. He had fond memories of cooking smelling good. He also loved his Cuban music. Second, he showed how grateful he was to his family for bringing him into this world and taking care of them. These two things show how Narciso Rodriguez made this passage a pleasure to read.   

<START>

 

The author of this thesis has created many atmospheres. One mood that has been felt is bliss because of how Narciso Rodriguez described his home as a place of childhood innocence, family, friends, and endless celebration. Another mood is gratitude as I never gave up on my friends, family and home and Narciso Rodriguez's parents had to give up their friends, family and home in Cuba to support Narciso. The final mood is the admiration that Narciso Rodriguez and his friends and family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation was a part of @ PERSON2, as well as going through financial troubles. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez made readers feel many moods while telling his inspired story.    

<START>

 

I think the vibe in this story was mostly happy and grateful. Because he loved living there with his parents and having family members around and being able to learn more about his heritage. And discover the whole kitchen. He seems to have had a very good childhood and always thanked his parents for it. they gave up everything to go to america to raise him and he is very grateful.

Who knows, this story could have been the best, but I just didn't want to stay at a speed. See me @ CAPS2 not the one talking because I can't write but I read and am fine so take it from a reader not from a writer. Plus, the story had to plan like any other story before it got good. other story @ CAPS2 will stop reading now boring and rush the answer be careful how you write or choose those stories you don't know what is best for me i do.

As @ CAPS3 continues through the passage, he says his family is open to everyone to take care of the people they love and who need help. @ CAPS3 quickly realizes that his whole family has given up on his old life to be able to offer him a beautiful home and teach him a precious lesson in life, the true meaning of family.

Also, when he spoke Spanish, Italian and Cuban, all of them love being a family. Another mood he had was rather sad. The reason I say this is because he was talking about how he couldn't be real grandparents until 1970. He looked a little depressed about it.

It means his parents really loved him because they wanted him to grow up and have a good life. And that was something they could find in @ LOCATION1. It is very caring for them because when they moved to @ LOCATION1 they not only looked after their baby but also other people who needed help. To them, everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all took care of each other.

In this memoir, the author creates an atmosphere. The mood this author creates is gratitude. The reason I say gratitude is because Narciso Rodriguez is so grateful and so happy to have two loving, caring and selfless parents. He is grateful to have not only a home, but a warm and comfortable home, where he grew up and has had so many memories. He is grateful to have all the perks of a traditional Cuban home, with the food, the music and all the people. life. Nariso can't imagine @ CAPS1 to @ LOCATION1 not knowing the language, knowing nothing and leaving everything he knows behind. Yet that is what his parents did. they sacrificed so much for him. and he appreciates that more than anything. I think the mood the author chose for this story was perfect.         

<START>

 

I think in some parts @ CAPS1 was happy. And then other parties @ CAPS1 was sad because @ CAPS1 is talking about his first home in America. @ CAPS1 is happy because @ CAPS1 can recall the memories and be happy.  

<START>

 

The mood of this memoir is @ CAPS1. I'm saying this @ CAPS2, his family always let the locals come and they were like family. Her parents let people stay with them "until they get back on their feet." @ CAPS3 admired his parents for their "strength and perseverance". Through everything they had been through.    

<START>

 

A mood for memories would be redemptive. It would be a redemptive mood because he talks about struggles like being immagene and being poor. It also explains how a community going through the same struggles can come together and help each other. The author also mentions how her parents sacrificed a lot to help her accomplish what she has become today. Since there are traditions that help the author to be successful, it would be a redemptive mood.    

<START>

 

The mood created by the author in this memoir would probably be gratitude. One of the reasons the mood is gratitude is how much Narciso loves his culture. "Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air, mingling with the aromas of the cuisine." It shows that he is grateful for his culture. Another way is to find out how many families he has that is not really family. "Alegria honored our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Sergio and Edelmira also at the table ... Bertha My aunts and cousins and Juanita Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also regularly joined our ... table." This shows that he is grateful to all of his extended family. Well, that would be the way his parents looked after him. "But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity which was imprinted on me at such a young age ..." It shows that he is grateful to his parents who taught her how important family and friends are.

<START>

 

The atmosphere set by the author is very solemn. He began by recounting the landscape in which he lived during a period of segregation. It was hard because he was Cuban. He didn't have a lot of money and lived in an apartment. His life was like a little below average life today. By the middle, the memories were still serious but happier in a way. It was happier because we know he could have more opportunities in life at @ LOCATION1. He grew up, met people and made new friends. Plus, he had a caring family who did what they could to make his life easier. He made memories and kind and passionate. The moods started a little shaky and very serious. Then he grew happier and happier as he shared how good his parents and family were to him. It ended in the same mood started in the middle of the passage, happy.

The atmosphere in the memories created by Narciso Rodriguez is comfortable. It's comfortable because reading the memoir made me think about my own life at home. And how important my family is to me.

Also, the wonderful music playing and the people always coming to visit us. And all that good family comfort that we all want at one time or another. This is the feeling I get when reading the memoirs of Narciso Rodriguez.

As I read these memoirs, I can imagine Narciso getting very emotional expressing how grateful he is to his parents and family. He explains, "I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a house" (@ NUM1). This sentence and the last paragraphs change the mood a lot. It went from being happy, appreciating, and explaining his life to deep, incredibly personal and full thoughts. Narciso had great love and admiration for his family and friends, as most people should be able to experience, as Narciso writes in his memoir.

In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a powerful mood for the reader. First of all, from the start, I felt love and thoughtfulness, which I have always felt throughout the story. "They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if that meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in the country they loved." It immediately reminded me of my parents. My father gave up his career and my mother abandoned her family to give me and my brothers a better life. This feeling is wordless. I can't describe the level of gratitude I feel, just like Narciso. Second, the admiration I shared with Narciso. She described her parents well enough to put me in her shoes. "I have told them many times of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and @ CAPS1 has thanked them many times." What her parents did for her was amazing and something to learn. From Narciso's story, I have had a sense of awe, greatness and connection, which I believe are the moods she has created throughout her story.

In the second paragraph you can see the love that reigned in the life and home of Narciso Rodriguez. "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed the two, formed the backdrop to our lives in a warm home." Love was definitely a great mood that reigned throughout Rodriguez's house and it shows a lot in these memories. Another mood that is very present in Rodriguez's memories is friendship. In the last sentence of the fourth paragraph, you can see this : “ My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. " This sentence shows how friendship and love what the Rodriguez family has offered always giving a helping hand. The last state of mind that emerges strongly from this brief is perseverance. The Rodriguez family moved from Cuba to a one-room apartment in New Jersey, the first paragraph states. The Rodriguez family took every job they could get and just wanted the best for their children. The Rodriguez family always stood up when they fell and in this memoir that mood shines brightly.

I think the brief puts family and friend in the mood because it talks a lot about the meaning of family, for example in paragraph @ NUM1 the author says "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great feeling that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. " This means that even if someone is not blood related to you, can love them as much as if they were. @ CAPS1 what the briefs said was “I learned the true definition of“ family. ”And for that, I will never forget this gracious home or neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

To describe the mood he created in these memories, I should describe it as a great feeling of love and gratitude for certain things called home and family. This memoir only gushes with appreciation for family, parents, love, courage, and a caring home everywhere you look. Rodriguez begins by describing his Cuban heritage and how he was always there as a child. In paragraph @ NUM1 it is written : "My parents ... passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that still accompanies me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Cuban music passionate (which I adored) that day) filled the air ... ". Here you can really feel that he appreciated the way his parents incorporated his heritage into his daily life as a child and how he still has fond memories of that time. Rodriguez then discusses in paragraphs @ NUM2 and @ NUM3 about the community he grew up in and what he has learned from being part of such a tight-knit neighborhood, such as opening his heart and his home to those in need. and never hesitate when your loved ones need help. This is shown in para @ NUM2, in two instances where he says: "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great feeling that" family "had nothing to do with being a blood relative. . " And where it is also said:" In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures have come together and a great solidarity and friendship. to have " Such courage " and how " They came selflessly " (para, @ NUM5) to @ LOCATION1. In para @ NUM6 it says, "I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice." Rodriguez really shares how their loyalty and great examples also helped him become the man he is today.

In the paper it is written: "My aunts Juanita and Bertha and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also lived nearby and we regularly joined at our table." This quote also shows the unity within the family. It was truly an accomplishment that the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the tough times of traveling across countries, getting new jobs and starting over from scratch was truly an accomplishment, especially at @ LOCATION1. The briefs show that, "... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved." @ CAPS2, the family created the atmosphere of conviviality, especially going through difficult times.

I think the mood the author is trying to convey is grateful and satisfied, and loved. An example of his satisfaction is "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations which encompassed both, formed life in our home." And an example of his gratitude is “My parents both shared cooking tasks and unwittingly passed on their rich cooking skills and love of cooking that is still with me today ...” And finally an example of him being loved is "Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great feeling that 'family' has nothing to do with being a blood relative." I can say that Narciso has these three feelings and he presents them well.

In the excerpt "Narciso Rodriguez" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a bustling New Jersey neighborhood filled with people of all nationalities. It is this melting pot of people and the hard work of his parents that shaped who he is today. The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, best exemplified by how the author himself speaks positively about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and hard work his parents had to endure to support himself, of which Narciso writes: “My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or language. Culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if that meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in the country they loved. " (Paragraph @ NUM1) Narciso's parents were not at all selfish and made a huge effort from the United States. However, through hard work, determination and courage, they are taxed @ LOCATION3. C ' is that positive and happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's house, as he writes, "the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the celebrations without end which included the two, formed the backdrop of life in our warm house. " (paragraph @ NUM2) the use of the word" hot "creates luminous and vibrant atmosphere associated with his house. heat idea is repeated later in the passage where the author writes "It was in the the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air not only with perfume but with life and love "(paragraph @ NUM3) The repetition in the description of the warmth of the house restores the mood positive. Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences, they came together in a friendly and united community, of which the author writes: “Despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship. (paragraph @ NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community always came together and was there for each other no matter what. This unity with the community definitely instills a good mood in the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive vibe throughout the memoir.

The author who created the memoirs created a feeling of comfortable home that made the reader feel the same. What I mean by a comfortable home away from home feeling is that the author showed how Narciso and his family get along and help people in his family, friends and people who just need a little help.

In the excerpt "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, the atmosphere created by Narciso was happiness. I know this for the following three reasons. One way I know the mood was blissful is when the article said "there was often someone who would stay with us temporarily until they could get back on their feet. My parents babysat. always their arms and door open to the many people we considered family "It showed how happy Narciso was that his parents were kind and very caring. Another way the vibe was to bliss is when the article said "I learned the true definition of 'family'. & For that I will never forget this gracious house or neighborhood," it shows how point he was happy to find a better definition of family through his stay at home "the last way the mood was happy was when the article said" my mom and dad came to the country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture, they came selflessly "Narciso showed happiness because his parents managed to get out of it. They are a big change in their life. It shows to how much the atmosphere created was "happiness. Her parents are wonderful people ”.   

<START>

 

The mood in the memories represents friendship, family, helpfulness, an example of helpfulness can be found in paragraph @ NUM1, it says "It was a tight-knit community of honest and hardworking immigrants reaching out to people who, although not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. " @ CAPS1 a good example of the mood in these memories is family, but is also related to help is in paragraph @ NUM2, it says: "My parents always kept their arms and door open to many people that we consider family. Knowing that they would do that is the same for us, that is what the brief is about. 

<START>

 

They were sad through some of these memories. The first reason they were sad was that they left families there. They also had to leave the country of Cuba. And left their friends. They were also happy too. The reason is that it is a Spanish, Cuban and @ CAPS1 community. So they feel at home. They were made because they half wanted to start their lives over. They would have to find new jobs and transportation.

The mood created by the author was a happy and exciting mood. This is because the family were so excited to move to a new place with better opportunities and for educational purposes. It also turned an ordinary house into a special house for them because over and over again they had people who eventually became family. Neighbors also helped set the mood by not creating any negative action or violence on the perpetrator who placed the family in a non-American neighborhood.   

<START>

 

The mood of the memories is kind and affectionate. It showed kindness in paragraph @ NUM1, which the memoir described how her parents made the whole house feel soft and nice. He did this by using words like " innocence ", " celebrations " and " warm home " to create a feeling of kindness. The love was shown when the author recounted how his parents welcomed anyone of all races to live with them until they "got on their feet." It shows love because when you are greeted no matter what the issue or who you are it shows love to everyone.

When you have a loving family and a beautiful home, you should be very grateful. Narciso Rodriguez was also very grateful. The general vibe of Narciso's story is gratitude. Narciso Rodriguez was born in 1961 in Newark, New Jersey. His memoir explains how @ CAPS1 is grateful for everything. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @ CAPS1 always spoke to his parents about his admiration for their strength and perseverance. Her family cared about everyone and "always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." Everything and all the mood of the memories is gratitude because Narciso was very grateful for everything.        

<START>

 

The mood of the memories is that he grew up in the house with his mother and father. Her parents lend a hand to people who need help. One explanation is when his parents moved here and left all of their friends and family in the hopes of giving him a better life. Another shows him his culture by making music, cooking, celebrating and taking care of others. Her parents let people stay at home when they need to get up. And by always having people for dinner (aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, @ CAPS1 etc ...).     

<START>

 

All of these things I listed all had something to do with the creation of @ CAPS1 in this brief. But the greatest feeling of all is the love his parents have come all the way from Cuba just to give @ CAPS2 a better life, even if it meant quitting their jobs, family, friends just to give their son a better life. Also, after arriving they lived in a one-room apartment for a year, then moved to a new house and made it "our traditional Cuban house" to teach their son the place to be. 'where they come from and make it feel natural to Narciso. When he was born. Even after that, they were still kind and had open arms for other immigrants. So I absolutely think the @ CAPS1 in this brief speaks of a feeling of overwhelming love.      

<START>

 

The ather creates the mood in memories in several ways. In @ CAPS1 @ NUM1, the author states: "Growing up in this environment instilled a great sense in me that family has nothing to do with being a blood relative."

This is an example because he appreciates everything his parents did for him and he always will too. This is how the author creates an atmosphere

The kitchen was the very heart of the house for the author. His parents were very skilled in cooking, which was passed down to their children. The author says in paragraph @ NUM1, "… A love of cooking that stays with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)." It shows the author's love for cooking skills. Next, how the author's parents love their children. They didn't know anything about @ LOCATION1, but moved there just to give their children a better life. Parents had to leave their family, their friends and their country. For example, in paragraph @ NUM2, he explains what parents should do.

The mood of the brief which I believe is grateful or encouraging. Narciso's parents are immigrants from Cuba who live in a vulnerable community and work to be able to provide for their children.

I often told them that what they had done was a much braver thing than I ever could have done." Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes "But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity which was imprinted on me at such a young age and for demonstrating the importance of my friends and family. my family for me.

Another reason he loves his family, especially his parents, is that they have done so much for the author. "They selflessly came to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in the country they love."

The mood turns soft when @ CAPS2 talks about being grateful to his parents for coming to @ CAPS3 as immigrants without any working knowledge of the @ CAPS4 language or writing. @ CAPS1 also says in paragraph five, "give their children a better life". @ CAPS5 these are many great details to explain the vibe that Narciso is trying to put in this passage.

I think the mood this author creates is love, happiness, and respect. He really admired and cared for his parents. In @ CAPS1 @ NUM1, the author remembers : "My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as do many immigrants, to give their children a better life, even if that meant leaving behind family, friends and careers in the country they loved. " @ CAPS2 of the vibe is that they took their Cuban styles and culture and brought them to @ LOCATION1, living in a simple house. Determination also plays a big role @ CAPS2. The author's parents were determined that their child would have a better life. The mood is the overall @ CAPS3 of the story, so I think it would be a mix of happiness, togetherness, caring, and determination.

The mood that the author creates in the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso @ CAPS1 from Home: The BluePrints Of Our Lives, is @ CAPS2 but happy and loving at the same time. Narciso creates a @ CAPS2 vibe as he explains the issues to his family and local friends and neighbors. Narcisco explains what they went through which makes a person feel @ CAPS4. Narciso also creates a happy and loving mood because he would say people were coming from all over "Composed mainly of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants" would come to this city, they would unite and help each other. They would also see themselves as a big family, which is made up of happy people and lovers. These are the atmospheres that the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates in the memories.

There are several ways to describe the mood of the author in this memoir. I think the general feeling and mood in memories is happiness and greatness. Narciso Rodriguez's parents were from Cuba and they weren't very wealthy. Narciso grew up in a three-room apartment in a neighborhood full of immigrants from Cuba, @ LOCATION1 and @ LOCATION2. Narciso had excellent parents according to the memoir he says in paragraph seven, last sentence "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a house." @ CAPS1 means @ CAPS1 didn't care how much space they had in the apartment @ CAPS1 just cared and loved the amount of love and relationship they all had with each other.

In the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez" From Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood that was conveyed to me was happiness, gratitude and sadness. First, the mood conveyed was a mood of happiness. The speaker speaks of his community when he says “All these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship” (paragraph @ NUM1). When it says "gathered", it shows the happiness the speaker must feel in the story. Second, the mood was at the fullness of the grill. When the speaker was talking about his parents he said "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice" (paragraph @ NUM2) When it says "thankful" It shows that the speaker has a lot of respect for his parents. finally the mood which was transmitted to me was that of sadness. When the speaker talks about his parents, he says "What they did was a much braver thing than I ever could have done" (paragraph @ NUM2). When he says "I already did it" he is sad that he does not have the chance to pay them back. All the moods conveyed to me in the story were happiness, gratitude, and sadness.

The atmosphere created by @ PERSON1 in the memories of Home The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of generosity and friendship. From an early age, @ PERSON1 talks about how often there was a guest at his table. It could be Alegria, her "babysitter and first friend", her surrogate grandparents, or any number of friends and relatives. There was a constant “congregation of friends and family” which they generously welcomed, for his family knew that because of his generosity, they would always be welcome in others. "My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." This constant congregation of friends and family in @ PERSON1's home creates an atmosphere of generosity and friendship throughout the brief.

The mood that the author has created in the memories is a warm, happy and pleasant feeling. When Narciso Rodriguez describes his home in Newark, @ CAPS1, I have this really happy feeling about his Cuban home. He says: "My young parents created our traditional Cuban home ... Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen." From that statement, I can clearly see couples dancing to Cuban music and their parents cooking a meal. The warm and positive vibe that Rodriguez created was shown through diction, where he uses a specific word choice. When he uses words like “ passionate ” or “ close-knit community ,” I can get that warm feeling. Rodriguez also set the mood for happiness when he described his Cuban party with all his family and friends. He says: "It was in the warmth of the kitchen of this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air not only with perfume and music, but also with life and love." (paragraph @ NUM1) The atmosphere of happiness and warmth is created by the author through his vivid and descriptive details.
