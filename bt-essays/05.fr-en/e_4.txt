Yes, I think some documents like books, music, movies, magazines etc. should be removed from the shelves of a library if they are offensive in any way. Librarians shouldn't have bad things on library shelves if they are offensive to some people. Libraries should only have interesting books with good stories to read and children's books. There shouldn't be any books, movies, magazines, etc. of a sexual or racial nature. Those things which are deemed offensive should be taken off the shelves as there are small children going to the library and they should not be able to see these things or check them out. I agree that the library should have a wide range of different types of books, movies, etc., because everyone has their own tastes in what they like. But things that are offensive shouldn't be on the shelves. If libraries didn't have offensive things on the shelves, no one would have to see them or have arguments about them. It would be so much easier because it wouldn't cause any problem for people because they wouldn't be on the shelves.            So if they just took these things off the shelves, no one would see them and there would be no problem in the libraries. Both adults and children could go to the library and choose what they wanted without seeing what was offensive on the shelves, which would make it a much better place to enjoy it.

When you want to read that special book that you have heard of but find out that some people find it offensive, what would you do ? Public libraries will remove all offensive material from the shelves so that no one can read them. Then that special book you wanted to read is now banned. A book someone worked hard on or a song or a movie is now put away because of a little controversy. Do you find this to be fair for our rights? I find censorship a very confusing topic in public libraries. If someone has to write and publish a book, then someone will want to read it. If some find it offensive, no one can read it. How is that fair to the people who appreciate it ? The way it should be done is if you don't like it, don't read it, don't take it away from anyone who would like to read it. I think some material in libraries should be censored to some extent. Like anything that contains nudity or adult content. This dose does not mean whether it should be removed. Items containing this content should not be taken but in an area reserved for adults only. Many movie stores and bookstores have the same idea, so why not the library just embrace this idea. As @ CAPS1, we have the right to freely express our opinions and beliefs. If someone wants to write a book about what they think is right, they are allowed to do so. If you censor something just because you don't like what they're saying, it's a violation of the constitution. You are allowed to express your opinion about it, but you take it away because @ MOIS1 doesn't like it to be wrong to do so. Do you just find that people spend so much time and money writing a book and a few people find it offensive so that no one can see it anymore ? I'm saying if someone puts the time and effort into it, it should be ok for those who appreciate it. Is it really that hard for you not to pick up a book that you find shocking @ MONTH1 ? Censorship is good in some cases, but imposing it too much on what someone calls offensive is against our right to free speech.

Should offensive material be censored? Removing things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that are found to be offensive can be both good and bad. This could be good because young children would not be exposed to things considered offensive. Although it can be bad as it takes away the freedom of choice. Most young children can't tell right from wrong, so censoring these things for them might be a good thing. However, you shouldn't want to shield your kids from the real world. By protecting your children from the things that offend you, @ MONTH1 keeps them from growing up badly. Censoring such things now doesn't really change what's already there. Censoring or removing material that you find offensive @ MONTH1 is a good idea. There are many reasons why someone @ MONTH1 wants to do this. A parent @ MONTH1 doesn't want their child to read, hear or see something just because it offends them. Another reason parents @ MONTH1 want to censor these things is simply because they don't want their child exposed to them. Parents know that most young children cannot tell right from wrong, so they would like to make that choice for them. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing or seeing. Some parents @ MONTH1 feel that they should protect their children from these things as it could harm them. They also think @ MONTH1 that it should be done so that their child does not grow up badly. Removing offensive material from the shelves would deprive a person of their freedom of choice. Who wants to be told what he can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it just keeps them safe from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around him before he grows up and is completely lost. Parents @ MONTH1 think this is a good idea because it protects their children from things @ MONTH1 is considered bad. When really, protecting them could be harmful. Censorship of books, movies, music, etc., will not stop what is already bought and released in our world. Offensive music, movies, books, etc. have been bought and sold for years. I think censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc., shouldn't be done. It doesn't give people a choice. Some people @ MONTH1 like to read graphic novels or things like that. Music is made for the enjoyment of people. Some people like their music to be about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean a person is going to do it. I think people should have a choice. Censoring such things now doesn't really change what's already there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been purchased by others. Many people have illegally downloaded or purchased music using inappropriate language. This music is already in their iPods, @ NUM1, and burned to @ CAPS1, there is no way to delete it. Books that some @ MONTH1 find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. One person @ MONTH1 is lending this book to another, so the offending book is spreading. Many films involving adult content, violence and drugs have been shown in the media. A lot of people own these kinds of movies. So why censor things now when there is irremovable offensive material already?

The many books, films, music and magazines in the world could be offensive. In all of these examples, there may be inappropriate language, images, and messages. No matter where people go, they can find something that might offend someone. Either way, people will try to get rid of anything bad, but the truth is, they will be around forever, if not for a very long time. In @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 all tenth grade students have just read "@ CAPS3 from @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5". The story is about a runaway @ NUM1er named @ CAPS6; and a runaway boy named @ CAPS7. many libraries have banned this book because of the use of the n word. '@ CAPS3 of @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5' contains profanity, and people don't want this book taught in @ CAPS2. Personally, I think it should be taught, because it shows today's students what it was like in the days of slavery. Music is something that almost everyone listens to. Songs always have a meaning or a subject on which the artist sings or raps. many songwriters write about love, money and fame, while others write about drugs, blasphemy and suicide. Hip-hop, rap, country, rock, metal, jazz, r & b, punk, ect., Are just a few of the hundreds of types of music available; and at least @ NUM2 songs of each type have a bad meaning behind. Magazines and movies are the same way. Magazines and movies contain everything from cars to bad pictures, historic places, facts and documents to action. Even though there are age limits on buying or viewing things, that still doesn't mean they couldn't fall into a teenager's hands. Because there is bad language in music, movies, books, etc., that doesn't mean it should be banned, just limited. No, it's not wrong to put what you feel in a book or a movie, just make sure it's well analyzed so that it can only be checked out or sold to people of the right age. What children and adolescents do now will affect the world later and will continue until a change is made.

We live in a @ DATE1 world inundated and persuaded by the media. Since we were little, our young minds have been filled with opinions about others in history and the present. Whether we read a book, watch a movie, or even listen to a new musical artist, our lives are affected by such media. The art world is considered one of the most controversial companies in which to work. Each literary or filmic work is shared by a vast community of critics. We are all entitled to our opinion on such plays. Each work of art is judged and then criticized. However, many find certain pieces to be offensive in one way or another. It is quite impossible to produce such a piece that everyone satisfies. For example, religious plays are often looked down upon for their non-factual information or for the director's or writer's opinion on the matter. Since we live in such a diverse faith community, these plays will never satisfy audiences. Movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some kind of lesson in life or truth that does not appeal to audiences. Why not learn from them and reflect? No media can be directed to satisfy the opinions of the whole world. As a personal example, I can see that war novels and books are heavily criticized. The men and women who fought for our country @ MONTH1 love to see such articles written about them, but the war protesters and peacekeepers @ MONTH1 see it as an insult to their cause. @ PERSON1 wrote a book called @ CAPS1 @ NUM1. This book has been heavily criticized on the subject of censorship. The world they lived in had been dramatically affected by the impact of peoples' opinions. If a book or a movie offended a group of people, they would burn the books. History books on slavery and war were burned because others found the subjects offensive. Non-religious groups thought religion was offensive, so they burned @ CAPS2 and other religious works. Their government wanted a world of peace and a community where all men were equal and where diversity no longer existed. @ PERSON1 denies that the book was written under censorship, but his book teaches our generation a great lesson. For generations, we have grown up in a world of diversity. Every mind is special and different and will never share the same thoughts as its neighbor. Therefore, we must recognize that we must survive and live together. We cannot escape the diversity in which we live. The books we see on the shelves, the movies we see on the big screen, and the music we listen to through our headphones are the story of our generation and the next. We must accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal. If we throw away our history and our achievements, man has nothing more to improve, nothing to leave his mark in history. We must accept the ideas of others and use them to improve our lives and the lives of others. As we stand @ DATE1 in a world filled with diversity, we need to step forward and think. Now is not the time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move forward

I am writing to you today to offer you an explanation of my view of censorship in libraries. I recently visited a library and some of the things I read while I was there was really overwhelming. I think they should be censored and taken off the shelves. If you are a business, you shouldn't want such things on your shelf. You shouldn't want customers to read it and feel disgusted. I hope that something I am writing will offer my reasons. I have many reasons to censor things and have them removed from the shelves which are offensive to me and to other people who visit the library, but only speaking on my behalf that there were certain documents such as books, music, magazines, etc., it was offensive. I believe that things in nature should be treated with great authority. If anything, I try to help myself and my fellow citizens. Just think, if a visitor walks in and picks up a magazine and it has insulting visual details about something the reader can relate to or has been through, and that's being talked about instead of being watched, then he would be very offended. For them to come there, it had to be a reason they came, I know it wasn't for them to feel insulted. It is very inappropriate to have things that are offensive in the library. There are many different reasons people come to libraries. Some come to get away from it all, and for others it's a daily routine. Either way, maybe they should feel comfortable where they are. Why would you want people in the community or people not to be comfortable where they are. Just think that if they are uncomfortable they will tell others and you will lose a lot of friends and a lot of business. Think hard about the things you do and how you approach things to get people's attention. To answer the @ CAPS1 question, I absolutely agree that the offending material is taken off the shelves. I believe in making people happy and one thing that is wrong in society today is judging too much, speaking contemptuously and speaking badly about people. If people didn't judge or curse people, the world would be a lot safer. It has to start somewhere, every little start brings a big end. I think that would be a good start to make the world a happier place and bring us all closer together. Hope something I wrote will help you in your decision

CENSORSHIP @ CAPS1: paper @ CAPS2 Do I think that some documents, such as a book, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. My opinion is this if someone wants to write a magazines or a book are okay because they give their opinion in it. Some people just have to say what they believe and others fight for what they want, not just censorship, but everyone has it. Some documents like music, movies, and magazines need to be censored because kids go to libraries, kids who are like @ NUM1 @ NUM2 grade or maybe smaller than that. We need to clean libraries of stuff that kids aren't old enough to see or hear. Libraries are a place to study and read a good book or maybe a magazine that we need to censor for bad language and bad images. This can be very offensive to some parents because @ MONTH1 talks about another person's color or bad language to offend the government. People don't have the act of stopping with these bad songs how to contain the censorship see some people writing that they say people don't have the act of being or saying what they want , I think we need people like that to just point fingers and say he's the bad guy but respond to what you did right to clean the shelves. Censorship is just a little fight to get bad content off the shelves it's just a call make your city a great place to live help libraries help you today change your future tomorrow make a difference

I believe there are some materials that should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive. I think kids should only be able to read certain books because some books say things should know until they get older. Certain books, music, movies, magazines should be deleted if they are offensive. I think they shouldn't be making kids movies, books, music like that for little kids. They put a lot of stuff they shouldn't in children's movies. The movie @ CAPS1 that they shouldn't let the kids watch this movie is not a movie that I would let my kids see until they are older. The reason is that it contains a lot of bad language. It's about those guys who take rubies. This guy is cheating on his girlfriend, and this just isn't a movie I would let my kids watch. There are people who get drunk in the movie. they do stupid things. They try to make it seem like it's the right thing to do and that it's so much fun doing all of these things. I just don't think it's a movie for the kids to watch. Some music contains too many bad languages. I think they should make better songs for the kids. Songs that really mean something or about someone. Most of those songs that they sing now are about stupid things that don't mean anything. I think some magazines are okay to read, but some are all about actors. Like @ PERSON1, I once read that he was doing something wrong here, and that she shouldn't be. I think it depends on what the magazine is and what it is about. I think if they are offensive they should be taken off the shelves. I also think that if they are not offensive and do not talk about bad things, children should be able to see or read them. If they did, the kids wouldn't talk and do things the way they do today. That the kids would n't try to relate and things like they do in these movies, they see them happen or their friends do. So they think it's cool for them to go out and do things like that, but it's not.                                       

<START>

 

An offensive meta-aerial like this should most definitely be taken off the shelf. What if a child finds it? They @ MOIS1 think it's the coolest thing they've ever seen. Children should not be able to access this type of material at all, especially from a place like a library. Someone could easily take it in the trade without knowing what it is. They @ MOIS1 start reading it and don't know what they're getting themselves into, but it would be a mistake to pick it up from the shelves. This kind of material should only be in places where it is welcome, not in libraries or public places like that. If the material was in a type of bookstore that was not intended for people under @ NUM1 then yes it is supposed to be on the shelf because the kids are not out loud in that building, they are not. so can't see it unless it was brought out of the store to a household or something. Depending on where you go, if this material is on a shelf, say in a place that is not that public, and you pick it up and start reading or watching it, you are responsible for not having researched the book or the Material case. If people want to get it, they can, but it would be at their own risk. There because if the consumer takes it off the shelf, he may be offended. There, because they can't blame where the material was.

@ CAPS1 us? @ CAPS1 now ? These questions might be going through your mind right now. The reason @ CAPS1 I'm writing to you today is to give you my take on censorship in the world's libraries today. In this context, I hope to be able to enlighten you on the subject, also with the questions '@ CAPS1 us?', And '@ CAPS1 now?'. What does censorship mean to you? To me that means censoring a lot of things in the world to protect it from underage children, not people old enough to handle inappropriate things. In today's libraries there is a lot of uncensored stuff, which can be found in the adult section of libraries. Things like books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the adult section, also labeled as the uncensored section, if that is where they rightfully belong. Now you are probably wondering @ CAPS1 us. In today's world, a lot of people want to protect their children from harmful things, such as uncensored content. @ CAPS1 us? In today's world, there are so many laws, regulations and even authorities that protect our rights. Now a lot of people want to try to get around the government that protects our rights. Many want to protect their young people from some of the so-called “ harmful ” things in society. Today you can try to create a law or a bill that @ MONTH1 goes through the government, now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material. @ CAPS1 now ? Over the years, the world has changed, everything has become easier to access. Now one thing they think they can do @ MONTH1 is remove the adult section of the libraries if enough people are fighting for it it won't happen. There is an adult section for adults not for children, people should be aware of that. In the end, the adult section must remain in our libraries. Some items in the section are not always bad, sometimes they contain items about war and recessions. When people are of age, they are allowed to enter the areas, not younger. Don't punish the rest of the world for a library mistake by letting kids have access to adult material, make kids understand that this was not their domain. Then many parents @ MONS1 see that it's not just part of the world, the whole world is exactly the same. Books, music, magazines, etc., should stay where they are

I think all the books and stuff should stay on the shelves. Because others should have the right to learn something if you have already learned it. Censorship is a bit out of the way. I think it doesn't really matter if they see it now or later because they're always going to see it and learn it later in life. If anyone wants to read it, I think they have the right because it is their own choice. I have observed students and adults in libraries and wherever they think they can handle it all. But that's what I think is right             

<START>

 

I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the library if they are offensive. Some people take it the wrong way and the libraries could have problems. Also keeps customers happy and you will get more guests every day. Finally, it might make someone feel better about themselves. First, some people will take it the wrong way and the libraries will have problems. If someone walks into the library thinking it's something offensive in the library, you can get a lawsuit. Also, it might make anyone feel looked down upon and not have to respect the library because the library does not respect them. This can provoke a plan in someone's eyes by making them feel like they're not equal with others. Second, it makes customers happy. If a customer feels like they see something offensive and the library gets rid of the item, it will make them feel you respect them. If you keep offensive stuff in a library, fewer people ejaculate in the library if they feel offended and have no say in whether it needs to be removed. The more people feel connected to the house, the more they will come. Then it might make someone feel better. If you walked into the library and saw something there that you didn't like, you would also want it deleted. If it was not removed, you would feel like you are not respected and that you will not feel wanted. Let's say someone sees something offensive and the library doesn't delete it and the person took a book out of the library and then never returned it, you would lose money because you should have some money. new books in stock. In @ CAPS1, there are many ways to troubleshoot and resolve issues without conflict. You can disrespect someone and they might disrespect you in return, but when it all comes down to it, you have to show respect to get it. something is helping people feel better about themselves and keep the day going. So before you make your decision, would you like us to do it to you?

Do I think that some material like books, music, movies and magazines that might be offensive should be removed from library shelves ? Of course not, surprisingly, there is still such a thing called free speech in this country. Just because some people @ MONTH1 find something offensive does not mean that material that is said to be offensive does not have the right to be posted or shared with anyone. Think of some authors who wrote books like @ PERSON1, although there were a lot of racist remarks in the literature of this period. That's not to say they still aren't part of American history. What would removing these types of books from the shelves do ? Absolutely nothing's what, racists ain't gonna go cause all those racist books are gone, I'm just gonna except everyone now. Music and movies are also forms of expression, and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive, so be it. You don't have to listen to the songs or watch these movies. No one can force you to do anything of this nature. People take everything literally these days, they have to have their part in anything and everything. When they should realize that most issues like these don't even concern them at all. That they should just focus on their life and not worry about everything they hear in the news.

Censorship in libraries is a subject of debate in today's society. This is something we should all think about and voice our opinions on. I think items in a library should not be censored based on the @ CAPS5 constitution, gray area creation, and classic literature exhaustion. From @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 to @ CAPS3 of @ ORGANIZATION1, clearly @ LOCATION1 the idea of press freedom. Not only does this give publishers the right to print what they want, it also gives people the right to choose for themselves what they can and want to read. To censor books in a library would be to deny this right which is clearly stated in @ CAPS4 of @ CAPS5. I refuse to support any idea that directly opposes @ CAPS3 and the folks at @ LOCATION1 should be appalled that this sort of thing is even under discussion. When it comes to censoring something on the basis of its offensive nature, one should always consider the gray areas that are going to form. For example, what is offensive in a book @ MONTH1 will not be offensive to someone else who would benefit from reading it. The term “ offensive ” is relative, as the definition varies from person to person. Nothing can be considered offensive by one hundred percent of the population and therefore nothing can be removed without opposition. This creates areas of gray where there is no correct answer. This would be extremely problematic for those trying to censor items in a library. Second, the decision of who decides what is offensive and what is not would cause as much controversy as the books themselves. Knowing that each person has a different opinion, decision makers should also represent each person's opinion when making the decision, talk about issue. Finally, book censorship would wipe out classical literature and exhaust the understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers. For example, in the '@ CAPS7 @ PERSON2' of @ PERSON1 the word 'n' occurs more than one hundred times. Many @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 are very offended by the use of this word. However, this book is considered one of the greatest works of the century and cannot be taken out of the education of young people because of an offensive term. If people want to censor books, then censor them of their own children and not of the children of others and inevitably of a whole population. In conclusion, censorship of literature and other objects in a library is not only impossible, but totally unconstitutional. The idea of censoring children's articles on the basis of an offense is not something that should be pursued

There are many forms of entertainment in the world today. Almost everyone has access to movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television, and radio. While these @ MONTH1 examples seem relatively innocent, there are many instances where they can be found to be very offensive. When the book, magazine, or movie was created, @ MONTH1 was not intended to be offensive. A group of people @ MONTH1 find something very offensive that most other people wouldn't even think of. There are many different types of consumers and it is difficult not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people. Some materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from shelves, even if they are deemed offensive. The act of censorship in libraries, or anywhere, should be despised. No one is forced to read a book or magazine, watch a movie or listen to music. If someone finds a book offensive, the solution is simple: don't read it. Others @ MONTH1 find the book inspiring and uplifting, and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong. There are many forms of entertainment that could be mishandled and offensive to people. Carrying out any book or magazine that might be offensive to any group of people would be a huge task. Removing all offensive books would remove a large part of the books available in libraries. If a person doesn't want to read a book due to the offensive nature of the book, then they can leave it on the shelf and choose another book. The book should not be taken away from others just because someone @ MONTH1 is offended. Everyone has a different view of things. A lot of people @ MONTH1 think of something one way, while others think of it completely differently. This is why all forms of books, magazines, radio, and music can be offensive to people. For example, a person @ MONTH1 will be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person does not think about it and continues to read. This person @ MONTH1 appreciates the book and passes it on to others. If it was taken off the shelves because it offended the first person, no one would have a chance to take advantage of it. Just because something is offensive to one person doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. I think the censorship in libraries is bad. There are many personal reasons why someone @ MOIS1 is offended by something, but that doesn't mean it should be taken away from the general public. People @ MONTH1 are missing a great book or movie if it is taken off the shelves because someone takes offense. If a person finds a book, for example, offensive, they can easily stop reading the book and choose a different one. No one is forcing them to read something they don't want. Also, the @ MONTH1 book would be very informative for another person, and to delete it altogether would be unfair to them. Censoring the content of libraries is a mistake.

Living in today's society, there are many different people and many different perspectives on things, the world is a diverse place that shouldn't have any restrictions. There are countless different ways of seeing the world and perceiving things. Telling someone what they should and shouldn't know is simple-minded because anyone can perceive a book, music, movie, or magazine differently. @ CAPS3 quote from Katherine Paterson, in short, metophorically uses a book and a shelf to enable the reader to understand the importance of information passed down from generation to generation. The book represents the information of the world and the shelf represents the place where the information is stored so that one can go to seek information. To take the book off the shelf indefinitely is to shut off the mind of a future generation. It was once said " you cannot know your present without knowing your future ". @ CAPS1 the book @ MONTH1 offends one reader, it could also inspire another. Everyone has a different opinion and lifestyle. @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 people have a better way of life than others, @ CAPS2 unfortunately live in struggle every day. A book that @ MONTH1 offends someone who thinks the book is hard and should be taken off the shelves, might also inspire a young child who is struggling to overcome their environment and become a better person. I read a lot of books that didn't interest me and passed them on to my brothers and friends. Surprisingly, the book interested them. After asking my siblings and friend about the book, it turns out they got a different message from the book than I did. No one thinks the same thoughts one hundred percent of the time. '@ CAPS2 @ MONTH1 maintains that the glass is half empty while others maintain that it is half full.' The quote @ CAPS3 is a perfect example of today's worldly spirits. In the end, if everyone thought the same thing, everyone would be the same person. “Don't leave any books on the shelf for any of us” is like programming a robot to do only what you say. In such a diverse community, it's impossible to remove a book from the shelves. Living in today's society, there are many different people and many different perspectives on things, the world is a diverse place that should not have any restrictions.

Reviews I don't think they should be deleted because in the books you say what it is about the back. The movies tell you what it's rated. It's mom or dad's fault. They are the ones who allow us to read it, watch it, listen to it or even play it. if they don't want us to learn it then they shouldn't even get it for us and the reason they get it for us is because the kids are spoiled. they want every little thing in the world and parents buy it to be happy. Parents are not the only ones to blame. Children are to blame. They are the ones who want to go to @ CAPS1 rated movies or get @ CAPS2 rated video games that have offensive language. children also tell each other offensive language and suspect them of knowing what it means. Children who have heard the dirty word will go to their parents and say " what the word means ". It happened to me and I said these words to my parents. When I first read and heard and watched it and told my parents what it meant, I was struck for saying that word. I thought they wanted to hear that from me. I was crazy to have never said that word, I wish I could go back in time and never say it to my parents. I don't know why I kept repeating it. I just couldn't get it out of my head. I got into trouble saying it just because I heard that stupid word I wish I had never heard. Heard it so many times i couldn't get out of my head it's like they know what it is but i know they don't know because they just said it randomly and I was pretty sure they hadn't told the parents because the one whose parents were said to be hit still hurt what he still had the red mark on his face thinking about what they had done wrong to deserve it. when i found out what this is lying i never said it for a long time until someone drove me so crazy i started to say it again. Now both opinions are still valid, how should we blame the parents or the children, should we remove the things that offend us so that the children learn bad words ? The choice is yours not mine because it was mine I would blame the kids and no we shouldn't remove stuff that has offensive language because for a lot of us we don't find it offensive for us or for others. Just consider this 'whatever you decide people will be against no matter what'

Libraries around the world face the barrier of censorship. Censorship has become a bigger business these days. @ CAPS4 can affect books, music, movies, magazines, and more. This post asks the question: is censorship a good thing or is @ CAPS4 bad? Censorship allows certain books to be taken off the shelves of a library if a certain person finds the book offensive. Everyone has their own opinion of things, so why would this affect what we are allowed to learn ? What one person finds offensive can be fine with everyone. Also, you don't have to @ CAPS3 anything you want @ CAPS1 '@ CAPS2. If you find @ CAPS4 offensive, a solution is very simple, @ CAPS1 '@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 ! Censorship doesn't just affect the learner, @ CAPS4 affects the writer. Censorship takes away the only thing a writer has, freedom of speech. Writers create books, music, and magazine articles to express their thoughts on topics, to show others how they see the world, and to show what might happen to them in their life. Because writers do this, @ CAPS4 establishes a connection with the reader that they can also understand and relate to. Writers have a choice of what they want to convey to the world, and they should be privileged to do so. While you can censor books and music in a library, you can '@ CAPS2 censor the Internet. The internet has become a place where anyone in the world can find websites they love, where there are books, music, magazines, and even stores. A library is a public library, just like the Internet is. Everyone should be able to access @ CAPS4 and enjoy what they love. Putting censorship on things is almost the same as not letting a teacher teach because of their nationality or not letting our president give a speech because he is @ CAPS5. Censorship is based on an opinion that someone has. @ CAPS4 should not @ CAPS2 affect learners or writers. Censorship restrains the voice of society and the thoughts of ordinary people. Censorship shouldn't even exist

Libraries are often thought of as a room full of books inside a school building. On the contrary, they are all over the country and are used by people of all ages. For this reason, I think there should be no restriction on what books a library puts on its shelves. If books and magazines are labeled, a person may simply stay away from what they find offensive. However, in the case of a school library, of course all books should be age appropriate. Just because you don't love it doesn't mean your neighbor won't love it. If someone finds a movie to be ridiculous and inappropriate, that doesn't mean someone else will too. Since all people are different, no one will like the same movies as the next person. Therefore, a personally offensive film should not be taken off the shelves and prevent the enjoyment of another individual. It's the same with magazines, books, and whatever else is available in a library. Parents' concern for their children is also a factor. However, if a public library has a section of books or magazines that is deemed offensive by a parent of a young child, I don't think that should force the library to remove the book. This is where I believe organization and boundaries come in. Adult books and magazines that might be offensive to children should be in a section in a separate room, or on a different level of the building. This would prevent accidental discovery by children. In addition to the organization, I think there should be a limitation, so that if a child deliberately walks into this section and grabs a book that is inappropriate or offends the parent, they might not be able to. consult at the librarian's office. Apart from public libraries, school libraries have a different requirement in my opinion. Elementary libraries, of course, should not contain any inappropriate material. All material in an elementary library should be strictly educational. At this age, children are far too young for any form of adult humor or magazine article. At the @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 level, I think things should change a bit, but should still be much stricter than a public library, and contain absolutely no offensive content. I feel like magazines and joke books are welcome in teen libraries. Nothing that would be inappropriate for school rules of course. Public libraries are a place where children and adults alike can find a book or movie to entertain themselves, and everyone has a different opinion. For this reason, there should be no restrictions in public libraries, and you should be able to get the books or movies you want. Within a school corporation, the environment changes and the rules must also be changed. Nothing offensive should be placed in a school library, regardless of the age of the students. Libraries should not be forced to remove books from their shelves.

I don't think they should delete music, movies, magazines etc, they should be deleted because if you delete all of this then there would really be nothing to do in your free time except get bored . I know a lot of people can't stand to be bored. I know I couldn't take it if I was bored all the time because someone took me from the music. Now, it would be a different story if we never had music and movies and all that other good stuff. No one would really care because they either knew what it was or worried about it. How would you feel if you had to drive @ NUM1 hours without having music or magazines to read ? I think you'd be really bored, I guess.

Libraries hold more than books, magazines and movies ... they hold history. Without a doubt, there is offensive material printed on many pages spread across the thousands of books and magazines that a library holds. Some find it terrible, but I, on the other hand, I do not agree at all. Each book has a different story to tell, and everyone understands the content differently, so I think libraries shouldn't take offensive material off their shelves. What is really considered offensive ? It would be very difficult to answer this question because everyone has a different point of view, different opinions and a different background. Some would say that violence, drugs, gangs and sexual situations are offensive ... while others find religion, beliefs, traditions and morals offensive. With all the different views on what someone finds offensive, a bookcase would have to clean their shelves almost completely just to get a small part out of them. There are many sections in a library, from fiction to children's stories. If there is an area for "children's books" and "adult books", can't @ CAPS1 be one for material that some readers would find offensive ? Libraries could even mark a book if it contained something offensive. That would settle many conflicts! If a reader chooses to read a book marked with offensive content, he or she would not have the right to get upset. Limiting the shelves of our libraries is unthinkable. If anyone was offended by what they were reading, they could put the book down as quickly as they had picked it up. A public library is a public place, where a lot of people go ... so if one person is offended by something they have read or seen, that doesn't mean the next person will. Ultimately, no book should be taken away because someone couldn't handle what was sad. "If I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you have the exact same right and everyone else too." And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. @ CAPS2 Everyone's point of view on offensive material is different, eliminating it would be difficult. Someone found this book offensive, so let's go ... The library would be useless. The shelves would empty, due to the loss of many phenomenal books. People take offense, it's just life ... I don't think they should be able to take a book from everyone just because of one person's opinion on it

Censorship has been the subject of many debates involving politicians, @ CAPS2 activists and the ordinary citizen. Some groups believe that the government has every right to censor anything considered offensive in today's society. Some people might challenge this belief by supporting the claim that it is not for the government to decide what is considered offensive and what is not. I just agree. One view, mostly held by people with children, is that books, music, and movies, etc. should be censored to protect the younger generations. While it is true that parents should be concerned about what their children are exposed to, if the offensive material that is involved in the daily life of an adult is completely prohibited for an individual as a child, how should- will he be prepared and excel in the future? Why do we go to school for at least twelve years of our life? We will prepare for the challenges of being an adult. We place ourselves in an environment specially created to put us at ease with the responsibilities of maturity. If he's not properly exposed to something, there's absolutely no way to prepare for meeting him in the future. However, not all people support censorship because of their children. There are adults who wouldn't want to see more of today's offensive material to themselves than they would like their children to see. My problem is, if you don't want to see it, don't choose to see it. No individual is ever forced to be exposed to anything in today's media. Turn off the television if the program bothers you. Don't read the book or the magazine. Change the radio station. Each person is able to control what they hear and see, and there is no point in trying to remove from society what might just be ignored. Finally, one of the most constant debates around censorship is that the government should control what is included in the media today. Think back to the story of @ LOCATION1 ; when has empowering government in our daily lives ever been good for our society? The reason our ancestors founded our great country was to have the freedom they were isolated from at @ LOCATION2. The @ CAPS1 of @ CAPS2 was created to ensure that the government cannot attempt to control what it does not have the right to control. Freedom of speech does not only refer to what comes out of an individual's mouth, but also what passes in their eyes and ears. The citizens of this great country are more than capable of deciding for themselves what is offensive to them and what is not. It is the government's duty to protect our country from other countries and groups of people who try to break it up, but not to control what we see and hear. Meetings and debates are organized every day to improve the quality of our freedom and sometimes to gain more freedom. I ask why some people would want to give a freedom that we have far away? The @ ORGANIZATION1 is one of the biggest countries to ever exist, but we are too lazy to decide what we are exposed to in our daily lives ? It's time for our society to stop being fed by the government and start doing its own laundry

Have you ever thought books were offensive? Maybe, but @ CAPS2 depends on who you are and @ CAPS1 makes you angry. Some people think that books, music, movies, etc. can be offensive in one way or another. I know they can, but @ CAPS2 can only affect a certain number of people if they together understand the problem. I think there are several ways in which and why not to get books out of our libraries. From @ CAPS1 I hear people get mad at things, but the question is " @ CAPS1 makes them so mad ?" " @ CAPS2 is different for some people than for others. For example, a fan of @ ORGANIZATION1 is reading a book about them and the author is laughing or teasing them. It's a way of making someone offended and angry with a book. others may get mad at a movie because @ CAPS2 discriminates against races of other types. As in @ NUM1, some films have characterized @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 as stubborn, ignorant human beings. In my opinion, being myself @ CAPS3 @ CAPS6 kinda annoys me too, but nonetheless, I shouldn't be arguing because of one major amendment, freedom of speech. @ CAPS2 depends on how @ CAPS2 angers them too, like in WWII @ NUM2, @ CAPS7 were characterized as short and fat people with a big nose taking all the money from @ CAPS8 . It can be offensive and is generally used to get people to their side. I think if something offends you slightly most of the time you shouldn't worry about @ CAPS2, but if you are very offended and none of the things they say about it are true you maybe get someone else to read @ CAPS2 with the same dislikes and likes you do. This could help determine if @ CAPS2 is really offensive to people in general, not just you. Then the main question we would ask would be " @ CAPS1 should we do next ?" " If I was somebody and that the book I read offends me greatly, I will contact the library where does @ CAPS2 and ask them to read @ CAPS2, and if they think @ CAPS2 is offensive, then they would more than likely take @ CAPS2 off the shelves. Now just because of someone who loves a sports team reads a book about them and the book is about the team don't tell the library it's just a waste of time. Just grab another book and read @ CAPS2. I can understand how people get mad at racism and discrimination, but not at a sports team. So I hope that people can one day understand the limit to which something can actually be offensive. Or maybe it's just our common nature that we take offense when something we love laughs at us. This is why I think books should only be taken off the shelves for very good reasons, not silly

I believe people can move like books, music, movies, magazines and other stuff they need. There are a lot of people who need it because of their knowledge. First, we should be allowed to use things like books on the shelves. Anyone is allowed to get books from the shelves, that is, anyone else's books or library. They take this because they need to use it and they thought it might be useful for their job. Another important reason is that we don't have enough memories to use in many situations. There are a lot of serious problems and also sudden accidents in real life. We don't have enough memories to handle these real situations. That is why we are allowed to remove a book from the shelf. The most important reason is that people want to know a lot of knowledge. I think it's people's desire to know everything and be smarter than other people or competitions. So, they need a lot of things for their knowledge and take them from the shelves. In conclusion, things like books and magazines are allowed to come off the shelves. Then the knowledge of books and magazines spread to many people who need

Do you like what I like? Maybe and maybe not. What is or is not offensive to you compared to others varies on both sides. Why? Everyone has their point of view. You @ MONTH1 or @ MONTH1 disagree and we have others who don't care. There are many that include: religious beliefs, independence and experimentation. Religious beliefs are important, don't you agree? Some elements of this world can be offensive to their own kind. Like gay rights. This @ MONTH1 applies to all the others that they do not accept it. For those who accept it, you can say that they are open-minded. Unlike the rebels who oppose it, it is their own state of mind. I believe it is important that you go with your religious beliefs. Independence is who we are or what we assume we have or already have. Whether music, movies, magazines, etc. are offensive to others, it has no effect on you. Why? It is because you know what is right and wrong. What if all the nonsense @ MOIS1 had caught your attention. Should we take control and get rid of it? No, you don't mind. You take it as it is, being independent. The experimentation is autonomous. As simple as it is, you either do it or you don't. It is more than likely that people are / were under the influence. I myself have been in this situation before. I am known to be the mad child of the family. My dad always taught me to be careful who I hang out with when I go out. As a teenager, I let these words pass. I was always the youngest person I hung out with. Have I ever been under the influence? Yes. Have I ever been injured? No. I can say and I will say that I have experienced life. Does it hurt to watch or experience evil? It usually varies. Religious beliefs he @ MONTH1 or @ MONTH1 is not disrespectful. To have independence, you are the one in control. Experimenting is a choice on your own. What is offensive to me @ MONTH1 is not to you. I have my own mindset and so do you.

Dear Diary @ CAPS1, I think the country should remove all books, movies, magazines, and music that has offensive cover, or offensive sexual contact in history, music, etc. Kids I don't need to see that stuff just sitting around like the radio, the music that they put on like rap, hip-hop with whatever it takes and singing about the money, the cars, girls and sex. Kids don't need to hear that stuff on the radio, and the adalt books in @ ORGANIZATION1 are ready for adalts to read, not kids. Children need to know all about sexual conflict someday, but not when they are. @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 year old watching pornographic magazines and movies. So I hope you keep that in mind to get this stuff off the streets and not out of the hands of children.

Prohibited books. “ We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this work that I abhor - then you have exactly the same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. Katherine Paterson Author I believe and will stand by Katherine's statement above. Who @ CAPS5 to say if a book @ CAPS5 offensive ? People have a right to their opinion, but I don't think anyone has the right to remove books from a library @ CAPS1. Library @ CAPS1, the facts are in the name. This is @ CAPS5 an @ CAPS1 library, where people can pick up a book to pass the time, a book to use for @ CAPS2 homework, or a book to read to their child. Taking a book off the shelves just because it offended someone doesn't make sense to me. A person can take a book, be offended and comply with it, this freedom of speech @ CAPS5. I see no fault in that. But when a person takes a book, @ CAPS5 offends and requests that the book itself @ CAPS5 be removed from the shelves of a library @ CAPS1. This @ CAPS5 when I'm having trouble seeing where they think I qualify. Katherine Paterson said in her text that "If I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you also have the exact same right and everyone else too. And then we do. no more books on the shelves for any of us. @ CAPS3 isn't that a scary thought? If a person was offended by a book, they could pull it off the shelf on their own ? I'm afraid 'resulting from this. I'm sure a person could find something offensive about any book. Removing books from shelves @ CAPS5 removing knowledge from people. As @ CAPS4, we have the the right to read any book we have the slightest whim to read as we please, and to be able to read that book without prosecution from a people who find the book in question “offensive.” The day we leave people behind taking books off the shelves because they offend them, @ CAPS5 the day our First Amendment t fails. As a nation, we must strongly oppose the library book ban @ CAPS1. For our generation and for many generations to come.

A @ MONTH1 subjects the censorship of library content to certain places and times, whether fictitious or not, in its own opinion. Personally, I don't agree with the concept. The facts show that the company is concerned about the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the results of similar campaigns and has systems in place designed to prevent such events. Some examples come into play to explain my opinion. Society, at least in my native @ LOCATION1 and surely abroad in other democratic countries, does not like forced censorship for several reasons. First, many countries have an @ CAPS1 of @ CAPS2 and respected privileges under the law. Our founding fathers drafted one of the documents establishing this trend under the impetus of the general public. The first ten amendments to our beautiful constitution, grouped under the name @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2, resulted from this. Some of the statements included guarantee the freedom to speak as we publicly please as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without borders. The removal of these principles so ingrained in the conscience of our nation would cause a general outcry. As a people, we instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare to replace it as implicit in @ CAPS3 from @ CAPS4 if we were asked to continue doing just that. Second, publications such as those mentioned to prohibit reprimand the application of opinion for its effects on society. I can mention three books describing this dystopian view of censorship. “ @ CAPS5 @ NUM1 ”, required by state standards for a possible reading choice assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and greater uniformity among citizens. '@ DATE1' by @ PERSON2, I know, describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely surrender their will and omnipotent '@ CAPS6 @ CAPS7', which uses omniscient surveillance even though I haven't read the composition myself . '@ CAPS8 @ CAPS7', a recent novel by @ PERSON1 whose title uses a pun on the name of the main antagonist of @ DATE1, weaves the gripping story of an older teenager who tries to beat the surveillance system under the radar. All of them, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and this fear transferred directly into local civilization. Looking at the aspects of censorship depicted in its effects, the system itself reveals that even the intentional creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship @ MOIS1 leads to decline and misery throughout the area in which government or civil servants practice the method. In any case, a more effective solution must exist today. To prove this point, let me introduce you to some content advisory systems currently in place. Libraries are divided into sections for different age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between different content groups deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity. The film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at different points in the video to provide the same type of psychological barrier dividing content into chunks. Even the video game industry, which I plan to inject myself into when I graduate from college, has a system in place to separate existing media into multi-level subcategories designed in the same way as ratings. of films. Different regions use different systems, but that of @ ORGANIZATION3, or @ ORGANIZATION1 for @ ORGANIZATION2, compares relatively well in the ranking of video games compared to the rest of the world. As explained, censorship already exists in a form acceptable to all. No one is forcing anyone to comply with the recommendations, but I hope everyone will do so on their honor. Capable parents very clearly follow the guidelines that have arisen over the years. Only if these moderation methods were applied would everyone be upset. It is up to everyone to avoid a worst-case scenario and to responsibly use the systems available for this purpose.

The ideas conveyed by literature, music and films are an art. They cannot be explained other than in themselves, and if one takes away the right to produce or the right to sell these masterpieces, then the world loses something of itself. Censorship is the underlying problem in a lot of things. It suppresses the expression of human thought and emotions - emotions like greed, love, fear, and the capacity for empathy that are conveyed in books and movies. If people think it's offensive, they just can't accept the truth. A lot of people can only express themselves in their art - and art can be very real. So real that you don't think it's possible. We don't want to believe that something like “ The @ CAPS1 ” could happen. 'The @ CAPS1' is a short story in which children get together and rob an old man's house. Because this man is very rich, he has a lot of material wealth. Then they burn the house with the man's belongings still inside. Needless to say, this story was banned from many schools and libraries. But what many do not understand is why the children allegedly burnt down the house. Many think that children just want to see it burn, destroy what is so dear, or that the love of material things makes us greedy. This is what makes us think, and this is where the problem with censorship lies. If we censor something that makes us think about who we are and what we are doing here, then we start to get lost. The loss of pounds has been observed throughout history. Above all, the Nazi regime. At the start of their control of power, they banned certain books that went against Nazi ideals. Censorship intensified with the Nazis burning books in big piles. This collective fire would make it easier to control the public's state of mind. The movement grew and the folks at @ CAPS3 quickly developed national pride and purpose. By @ DATE1, almost every @ CAPS3 that could read had read '@ CAPS5 @ CAPS6'. Censorship had turned into an all-out war against classical literature and the promotion of Nazi ideas. This is how @ CAPS7 was voted. Many don't realize it, but the @ CAPS8 actually voted @ CAPS7 to be the leader. Now that the Nazis had destroyed public ideals, they have been replaced by the Nazis. Banning the media can only lead to a general lack of self-knowledge. The human state of mind can only be expressed through the art that humans create. If we try to explain it, we quickly get lost in our words. Using verbal and visual examples is the only way to learn who we are. Censorship has never resulted in anything good, only in promoting something bad. If we allow our media to be banned, we lose the right to have our own ideas.

What I think about this is that you have your own opinion on a book, just because you don't like it doesn't mean other people won't like it. There is @ MONTH1 something you like about a book that you dislike about a movie, and there may be something you like about a movie that other @ MONTH1 doesn't like about a book that doesn't mean it should be taken off the shelf. About magazines if there is some stuff in a magazine that you don't want to watch or make your kids watch then yes they should be taken off the shelf, I mean come on now it's a library , there should be some things that are up there that's all I'm saying

There are a lot of different things in the media that are shown every day that are very offensive. I'm sure anyone can honestly say that they watched or heard at least one thing in the media that offended them. People should also remember that this is a free country and everyone has free speech. None of the TV channels or radio stations should have any trouble because that is freedom of speech. I am not offended by anything I read, listen to, anything on TV. I really don't see how people can be offended by all of this, because it's not like something is being said directly to that person who is being offended. I've heard of people trying to sue a record company for songs they find offensive. I think it's ridiculous to try to sue someone just because it offended you. It's not the record company's fault that you take offense, and there is no reason a fan should suffer for such a reason.

Some material such as books, movies, magazines, and comics can be offensive to some people. When we look at a comic and see that the author of the comic has said something offensive, what @ MOIS1 seems offensive to you @ MOIS1 is not to someone else. Some images or writings that you feel are full of knowledge and vibrancy @ MOIS1 are completely different in someone else's eyes. How many humans inhabit the world today? About @ NUM1 billion, according to the researchers. If you think about it, each of those @ NUM1 billion minds thinks differently. If a librarian takes away the knowledge you find so alive, it's like taking away a person's ability to learn. In today's world, many adolescents and young adults are getting more involved. What this teenager reads in this magazine article could spark a whole new reason to help the world. As far as you know, the magazine could have brought the young adult or scientist one step closer to finding a cure for cancer. How can you just take that off? Again, the magazine might be offensive to someone who @ MONTH1 has cancer or a doctor who treats cancer, but will they be offended when their cancer is cured ? Or when the doctor can successfully say that all the cancer in your body is gone? If we remove anything that might be offensive to other people, we might as well remove all the books, movies, magazines, and comics that have ever been created. Again, something that @ MONTH1 is offensive to you wouldn't be offensive to another person, because about @ NUM1 billion minds don't all think in the same way. If reading materials deemed offensive were removed, our ability to learn and grow as human beings might as well be suppressed.

Culture and history are two very important aspects of the world. Libraries are places that house these same things for the enjoyment of all who visit them. That's why I think libraries shouldn't censor any of their material. Learning has always been and will be a key aspect of life and libraries offer it freely! How can we take this freedom away from another? All things in the world and the story are not perfect and have turned out ideally. However, topics such as slavery, @ CAPS1 and other controversial topics need to be known. These horrific events @ MONTH1 offend some but they cannot be erased from the past. Learning is natural for humans, but we always try to fight it. It is not fair to hide the truth. Some people are easily offended and some are not. But the real question is " who should say what is offensive ?" ". There are people who think that discussing @ CAPS2 in the Christian religion is offensive and others who think that any type of homosexuality is too. Yet there are still others whose beliefs directly contradict them. Libraries need to keep all types of documents because their goal is to hold knowledge and not just what people want to know. How can we make better decisions in the future if we don't recognize what happened in the past ? Removing information from the library because it is offensive is essentially depriving people of solutions to problems. All aspects of culture and history must be preserved so that we can know where we came from, the mistakes we made and how we plan to fix the new ones! History has never been under human control. In conclusion, libraries should not censor any of their documents. What happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions. And in doing so, we are depriving future generations of information that could potentially be useful. We must never forget who we are as a people and where we come from. Our knowledge and ability to learn are our greatest asset and should be treasured.

People of all ages have the right to read any material they want @ CAPS1 or other @ MONTH1 family members to tell their children not to read on a certain topic. These children will listen or not to their @ CAPS1. If these kids aren't listening, we have to do something. We need to have rules in libraries. Children don't need bad influences in their lives. Adults have the right to keep children away from this information. Library managers have many different sections in their library. Children and adults both have their own sections as well as teenagers. These groups of people have the right to choose the material they want to read, watch or listen to. I think if we make the sections have an age limit, we can prevent kids from finding bad information. At present, children can read this information at any time. Adults can eliminate it. Children in libraries should be supervised. Too many books are about drugs, sex, or pregnancy. Reading this @ MONTH1 material gives a child the wrong information. Children are not old enough to learn sex. @ CAPS1 should be the first to talk to their child about sex. Young children know about drugs and know that these drugs are harmful. Children learn about drugs in movies and books and can hear about them in music. There are also many books on pregnancy. Learning about pregnancy makes them think about how women got pregnant with a child. These children then begin to ask other adults and children. Children can also read or listen about gun violence. Kids read about gangs and think it's cool. They then want to play with toy guns and pretend they're part of a gang. This information is very harmful and should not be allowed to children. After some kids read about it, they involve their friends. This information can spread throughout the school. Violence is very harmful for children. Librarians do not control the material that people want to read. If this library has any offensive material, it is their job not to let that material fall into the hands of a young person. They should be able to have strict limits on age-appropriate material. If a child is trying to read a book and appears to be over their age limit, they should not be allowed to have the book. Sections in which they @ MONTH1 find damaging information should be closed to young children. Children in libraries should be supervised. Books about drugs, sex or pregnancy @ MONTH1 are not permitted to be read by children. Violence in books seems to be rampant in schools. Adults can help prevent harmful information from all children.

I think their should be rooms with some adult books. I think they should be of legal age to have the books in this section. I am convinced that libraries should have all types of books for everyone. Everyone goes to a library, so I think it should be an open library and have all kinds of books. If a child or teen is trying to get an adult book, someone of age should come to their house and check the book for them. I think libraries are for everyone in a community and not everyone reads and looks good beautiful books, some people look at naughty books and they should be allowed to go and look for books like that. When you go to a library you should be able to go there and get the genre you want without any restrictions. I think the only restriction that should be made is the age limit for naughty adult books or novels and if they are really bad they should be behind the desk and you have to be of legal age to get it. My conclusion is that if you look at all kinds of books, they shouldn't have any restrictions on what you look at. You should be of the age for romance novels and drama books, but for the library, they should have tons of books and magazines with no restrictions.

What do we find offensive? In a library, there are hundreds of documents that can offend anyone. For example, with movies there is horror, science fiction, comedy, romance, adventure, etc. and all of them are offensive to someone. If we were to remove all the movies that are offensive to one person, all the movies would be removed. Should we remove all the things that are offensive to us from the shelves, or leave them for the people who appreciate them to do. I believe we should leave these materials alone. It shouldn't be fair for us to choose what a public library should and shouldn't have on its shelves. If a person finds something offensive, then they should ignore it, not make a big deal out of it. Many people learn to keep their objections to themselves, but some don't. People who judge by what they don't like tend to make themselves known

Censorship is the most loathsome and terrifying part of society. Our lives have been taken over by political correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer ours. Until recently, we had the freedom to transmit our thoughts, whatever they were, in any form of media. But now, if something is found to be offensive in any way, it's basically burnt. Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our @ CAPS2 as citizens and people, protects us from the truths of the world, and limits what knowledge we can learn, all while ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of the media. The @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2, the document our country lives on, says that we as a people have the right to free speech. Censorship actively and violently violates this right. Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away from us. Our own words pushed us by the throat, never allowed out. Censorship ensures that no opinion will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves. Isn't that what we are supposed to guarantee freedom of expression? We are supposed to be able to say whatever we want. We know there are consequences to saying certain things, but we are supposed to have the right to say them. Leaving our own ideas in the world allows new ideas to be formed. Arguments do arise, but these arguments allow people to see other ideas they hadn't thought of and to look at issues from new perspectives. We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions. And from there, we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich in ideas and knowledge, and allowing our society to move forward. But the censorship wants to take everything away from us to please everyone. But there will always be someone who will be unhappy. This is the inevitable truth. Censorship tries to protect us from the ugliness of this world. In a way, that makes sense. We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life. We don't want them to know what is going on behind closed doors. However, if we do not allow people to open these doors, they will never be able to understand the world or prepare for the experiences to come. Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, enabling them to stop these realities and prepare for when they happen to them. For example, let's look at the issue of rape. Rape is a horrible thing, but it does happen. It's a nasty part of reality. Rape can be censored in books, television and other forms of media. You can walk around pretending that rape doesn't exist. But that doesn't help. It does not eliminate rape. He still exists. And if people are not educated on the issue of rape, how will it ever end? How can rape ever be prevented? How will anyone know what to expect or what to do? By censoring rape in the media, we ensure that future generations never learn about rape. Knowing about rape is important if it is ever to be stopped. Pretending that something does not exist does not get rid of it. Censorship is supposed to protect people, but it isn't. It hurts people, by cutting off their access to knowledge. We as people need knowledge. We live on knowledge. And the way we get that knowledge is through the media. Censorship gradually takes away knowledge. It looks like not much is missing from @ MONTH1 now, but over time the gap will grow and more knowledge will be taken away from us. Is it right? Is it correct? Does this help us? How does the suppression of knowledge ever help ? It makes us go back in time, scares us. It is human nature to fear the unknown. The more unknown it becomes, the more we have to fear. Censorship robs us of crucial knowledge that we need to understand in order to get along in society. It is false and immoral. It is unfair, to say the least. We should be allowed to tap into all the knowledge that exists. There is nothing good in hiding it. Finally, this progressive combustion of knowledge is affecting society in horrific ways. And over time, it can only get worse. Censorship is based on the offensive. If anything can be offensive, it is eliminated. However, anything that exists in society could be offensive to someone. Therefore, everything and everyone should be censored in order to achieve the purpose of censorship. This means that all media, whatever it is, must be destroyed. No one should say anything. The world would be forced to shut up. All knowledge would be taken away. Chaos would ensue. The freedom of the people would be completely taken away. The freedom to know would vaporize before their eyes. It is our future if we allow the censorship to continue. We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship. Yes, people's feelings will be hurt, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge just to spare the feelings. These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship prevail. Censorship takes away our freedoms and @ CAPS2 steals them little by little. It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and that we can never stop the very things that are being censored. Censorship affects society, ensuring that our freedoms must be taken away. All knowledge will be destroyed and no one will be able to express their opinions. A very dark future awaits us if the censorship continues. It is only by helping people understand censorship and the harm it does to society that we can regain our freedom of expression; the freedom that is supposedly guaranteed to us, but the censorship desperately tries to deprive us.

Documents deemed offensive should not be removed from the shelves. People may need these documents for research or if they just want to find out something. If the material is offensive to someone, they can report it, but the people who work in the library might not do anything about it. People who find something offensive may also ignore it and walk away. If I found something that offended me, I just ignored it. I could watch him to see what he says but I won't say anything about it. There are people who should be looking at that for research or whatever. So why take it off the shelves? I haven't seen anything that could offend me yet, but if I did, I wouldn't say anything. Now some people would say something, but what if you walk into a library looking for a book for your research paper and it wasn't there because someone was there? found it offensive ? What would you do? Yes, you can access the internet, but it may not have exactly what you are looking for. I had a lot of research papers. There was a time when I went to the library and couldn't find a book or magazine to help me with my research. I had to wait over an hour just to access the computer and search for information. When I got to the computer, I only had an hour to research everything. I didn't do it on time and had to deliver it late. Computers are good at finding things, but when you have a book in mind that would give you a lot of information, you go with the book and not the computer. I know there are documents that are offensive to people. I know people get mad at them, but it's not the libraries' fault. They most likely must have these materials on the shelves because that is what is expected of them. So if people get angry they can report it or just go away and ignore it.

For @ CAPS1 it is @ DATE2, @ CAPS2 in life has to face something offensive to them at least once. It @ DATE2 be swear words in a popular song, or even the behavior and actions of people on a regular basis. Anyway, like @ DATE2, no one has been done perfectly, and we all have to learn to deal with people's faults. The library is for everyone; not just you specifically. Just like people's personalities, we have to deal with different things that correspond to these specific personalities. The quote from @ PERSON1 read: "But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf ... then you also have the exact same right ..." @ CAPS3 is a strong and true accusation, and I believe that things in a library should have some censorship, but up to a point. We all realize that the largest population of people in a library - and perhaps the most innocent - are children. Each parent has different values and standards for their child. That @ DATE2 is offensive to one parent @ DATE2 is not offensive to another. If a mom thinks that a book that talks about something she considers inappropriate for her children should be deleted, another mom @ DATE2 doesn't. The opinion of the first mother is different from that of all the others; she could tell that she wanted the @ CAPS3 book removed from the library, but the second mother could also talk about a different book. If everyone expressed their opinion about the books that they did not consider appropriate for their children, then we would "not have any more books on the shelves for any of us." according to Katherine Paterson. I believe she is right. Besides, who can say what's good for everyone? No one person has the same morals or the same values as another. The fact that one person declares what is right could seriously offend another person. I have already faced situations like @ CAPS3; everybody has. People tell me what they think is right and I disagree with them. It is simply a matter of everyday life; people's opinions and mores will collide. Everyone is different, and if one person doesn't like a certain magazine in the library, another person @ DATE2 doesn't like another. If we were all to express our own opinion about what we want censored and what we don't want, there would be nothing left. The shelves in the library would be completely empty. Even though everyone has different opinions on what should stay and what should go, I think there should be some censorship to some extent. Considering how diverse everyone is in the @ CAPS3 world, I think there should be some censorship to some extent. If there is something in a book that a good majority of the population is against, I think the book or books should be taken down. I'm not saying this because a few people weren't for a certain artist from @ DATE1 that he should be removed immediately. If this is a major issue that greatly offends many people, it shouldn't be in a public library. Libraries are used for information and reading; not to stir up offensive opinions on certain matters. There should be some limit to what's in a library, because there are things there that people really shouldn't see or hear. But it shouldn't get to the point where people can just pull books off the shelf on their own. Without any censorship limit in a library, absolutely anything could be found there. When we think of a library, we don't think of shocking things. People see the library as a positive place, created for their own enjoyment. That doesn't mean we'll never find something that @ DATE2 somehow offends us, but people shouldn't be able to just pull books off the shelf because they aren't. accord with their morals. @ CAPS2 is different, and no one has the right to tell them exactly what is right or wrong, up to a point. I know from experience that it can be hard to ignore sometimes, but we all seem to do it every day with the people around us; we can't just choose to get rid of it. @ CAPS2 wants to be comfortable, but sometimes we just have to deal with things in life like a book that we don't think is appropriate. So I think in a way, over-censoring things in a library can be a bad thing. If we could all get rid of what we wanted in a library, there would be nothing left. After all, I wouldn't mind stepping into a library with shelves full of magazines and books, instead of one completely empty. Thank you.

Libraries are ment for all types of books, movies, music, magazines. It gives you a variety of things to watch or even check out. An offensive book or movie or even music shouldn't be taken off the shelves just because it has a few bad things in it. People @ MONTH1 or @ MONTH1 don't agree with this, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Through my own experiences, observations, and readings, I will help and explain my own opinion on why I don't think offensive books, movies, music, and magazines should not be taken off the shelves. If a book is offensive, it doesn't deserve to be taken off the shelf. Someone probably worked hard on this book so that it could be put on a shelf. If you find an offensive book, it should be placed in a different section which will tell you in advance which books are in that section. I haven't had any real experiences with this, but I know people are wary of what's in books before they get put on the shelf and therefore wouldn't put anything offensive to. side of a children's book. Same thing with music and @ CAPS1. Music is music and it is there to be heard too. People love all types of music and have their favorite bands, so if they don't like certain bands because they swear or whatever, that doesn't mean this album is worth taking off the shelves. . @ CAPS1 usually has the rating on the front, so if it's not suitable for your age, don't take it. If it has nudity or sexual content it will either tell you or be placed in a different section. For example in my old library where I lived at @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION2 they would put all @ CAPS2 movies rated in a different section and if you wanted to check it you had to be @ NUM1 or older or have a parent with you . It really all depends on the person, they can either make the right choice or they can make the wrong choice. It's not the libraries' fault if you pick up an offensive book, because you should have some common sense. Libraries shouldn't have to take offensive things from shelves because some people lack common sense or just don't know what they're doing. They might try harder to separate bad from good, bad from good, and even appropriate from not appropriate. But it usually depends on who is making that decision. - @ PERSON1

I think censorship might be a good thing where there might be an adults only room. In the Dunkirk library there is a room which only contains books for adults and children cannot enter it without a parent. So every time you go there your parents are with you. But I don't think you can verify them. But if I had a kid I wouldn't want them to see this stuff until they're older, so I think there should be separate bedrooms. So whenever they got older and matured, they could go out there and see the books and maybe someday check them out and read one. But on the other hand, why not leave them on the shelf for the kids to see, because otherwise they will see other places or other people, so they come home asking mom what that means and why not let them learn a book on their own. There are people who don't agree with that, but there are people who don't agree with it. So maybe there should be rooms for different books and you can go anytime you want or maybe there should be some rules that you can't go without a parent. I don't know what to do maybe there should be a vote among people whether they like it or not. But some people would be mad about it, so if you chose one, someone wouldn't like it or something like that. My idea is to just keep the books there and let the kids figure it out for themselves. Some people would think I'm a bad parent but would you like your child to find out somewhere else.

Katherine Paterson once said, “ We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you have the exact same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. I don't agree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is an @ CAPS1 to @ CAPS2 and the @ CAPS1 to write. The author clearly intended to write the novel, compose the music or deliver the film. There will always be articles that are offensive to some people, but for others, there is a meaning behind it. The @ CAPS1 of @ CAPS5 gives everyone the right to say what they think. This @ CAPS1 allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music or in a film. Of course, there are @ MONTH1 some parts that @ MONTH1 are inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or movie, but that doesn't mean the entire element will be inappropriate. Some people might think that some things can be offensive while others don't think so at all. There might be things in this world that @ MONTH1 thinks are offensive, but did you stand up and tell this business yourself ? Being able to write down whatever you want everyone to know is the @ CAPS1 to write. With that, we can't tell you not to do it. For example, the magazine '@ CAPS6' may offend a lot of parents who do not want their children to watch it, but this magazine is not intended for children. The purpose of this magazine is to show adults what to buy to make them look sexy. This is not to offend anyone and this company has the @ CAPS1 to write to post such a thing. The @ CAPS1 to write serves its own purpose for all writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or write a note. I bet there was a novel or a piece of music or a movie that you love. It most likely contained inappropriate information, but would you like it taken off the shelf ? For example, I once read a series when I was in college that had inappropriate content about sexual interactions, but this series is what all the girls wanted to read. If they'd taken them off the shelves because they weren't appropriate, then I know a lot of other novels that would have vanished as well. How about if there was nothing left on the shelves to read, listen to or watch ? Without articles such as books, we might have a hard time learning new things all the time. These are the things that teach us new things every day. Would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read, watch @ CAPS7 movies or shows, or listen to music? It would be very hard to get used to in today's society. We rely on such things @ NUM1 to help us get through the day and teach us things we have never learned. Disagreeing with the quote Katherine Paterson stated is one way of using @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS5 in stating my take on removing inappropriate items from the shelves. Removing items from the shelves will not solve the problem of over-misuse in today's society. If anything that contained inappropriate content was taken off the shelves, we'd be hard pressed to find a novel to read, music to listen to, a magazine to enjoy, and a @ CAPS7 movie or show to watch. Many schools rely on books to read and without a book, children's vocabulary could have a big drop. Think about it ... what would you be able to do in your spare time if we ran out of books, movies, magazines or music

Books, magazines, movies, music, etc. are all good to read, watch, or listen to. When I listen to music or watch movies or even read books sometimes. I wonder how people come up with these ideas. The real reason is why people listening to music, reading books, and watching movies are so offensive. In today's world you have music with all this negative stuff about people, talking about people, with swearing, it's not a good look for people who make music or people who listen to music. I think this stuff shouldn't be allowed on the shelves and should be removed. Parents don't want their little kids to hear this negative music. When they grow up, they'll be like them because everybody sings songs there and everything else. I think films shouldn't be taken off the shelves. The reason I say is because movies are funny, scary, sad, etc. Sometimes you need to be offensive in a movie, but it isn't right most of the time. One of my favorites is @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and it was about the character from the past @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS4 get together and do one more mission. This movie was offensive but you still have a good time watching it because it has nice cars and a good character. Movies should never be taken off the shelves, because offensive movies would not be fun. People can't go to the movies with their friends and have a good time. If you are taking small children, be sure to pick the right movies to wrap up the argument Music is not a bad thing to listen to because you have great music, but all I'm saying is is watching what you are listening to and getting into trouble trying to do what they say in the music. Movies keep coming out with great movies and keep making great movies

People go to the library to find certain types of material. Some people are offended by certain items and feel that they should be deleted. Some documents should not be removed if they are deemed offensive to others, as they might not be offensive to someone else who might benefit from them. The offensive material can be the story the world needs to know, such as racism. If they didn't know the importance of slavery, they wouldn't know the past life and why we are treated the way we are treated. History is a big part of life that everyone should know about. This is why we have history lessons to let us know the history we have gone through. Not all of the material needs to be the offending story. Some content contains sex and violence which is offensive. Libraries should have labels on each section to let people know what type of material it is. If people know what kind of material it is and still choose to see it, they get what they ask for. He shouldn't be deleted because they didn't like him. I learned in history class about wars that involved violence that some of my classmates didn't like, but it did and we needed to find out. Materials are made for a reason. They should not be removed if they are found to be offensive to someone but not offensive to another. I read books in school with all kinds of violence and stuff that people at @ MONTH1 don't like but that's history. History makes a difference in our lives and this is what we need. You cannot delete this. If you find this offensive, then stop viewing this material.

I believe that books, music, movies, magazines should be deleted if they are really offensive. Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't mean it would be offensive to another. Any movie you watch may be offensive to one or two people, but not to everyone. So I would say no to removing offensive things from the shelves because who is really going to be offended and are they really offended by that question or aspect. Also, I believe that some people might lie if they are offended by it just to take it off. Maybe there's a movie for example, there's a lot of swear words, I could see them being able to pull them off on their own because a lot of people don't like those words to be used and that's understandable. If they're only doing it for a small thing, I don't think it should be out loud. I think if that person is offended by what a book or movie says, then don't read or watch it. No body is forcing you to look or read a book you don't want. Reading and watching a certain movie is up to you, not what other people say. I believe it really has to come down to what people's beliefs are. Maybe they go to church every day, which means they probably won't watch the movie '@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2.' They will choose a film more suited to their lifestyle and their use. Maybe they had a friend who suggested they watch a movie and they did, maybe they were offended by that, but it was also the choice they didn't have to watch . If it was the case to release a book, a movie, a music because someone was offended, there would be nothing left. Are you saying you would listen to everyone if they come and get a book and then come back and say “ this book offended me, I want you to get rid of it ”. I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that you are going to listen to everyone who comes to say it. Also, @ CAPS3 did you know that was offensive to them, are you going to ask them to show you what was wrong with this book ? I guess not because you don't want to deal with so many people about one or two or even five pounds. I'm not saying that people aren't offended by what the books and movies say, but you're going to have a lot more than one person coming in and saying there's more than one book or movie. then there would be no more books. What if you bring someone in and they ask they have a certain movie and you say "@ CAPS4 I'm sorry we had to remove this movie because it offended someone? 'a. " I have a feeling this person is not going to be happy and you will have to explain. Also, what if a person comes in and asks for something and you tell them you had to take it out and they say it was a really good movie, will you listen to it too if you listen to one person don't you think it's fair if you listen to the other person who also likes the movie. I am a person who believes that there are two parts to every story. So therefore, I think you should listen to both sides or keep what you have if that person wants to take it off on their own then do that but, if anyone asks for that particular one, I would let him have it because it's not it's not going to hurt the person who was offended by the book or movie, right. Therefore, I think they should keep the books, movies, and music on their own unless more than one person is complaining, then that would be another story.

Movies are to popcorn what music is to headphones. To the right? It's all fun and games until someone's innocence is completely destroyed. The simplest forms of entertainment are downplayed in today's world. Many children in our modern society quickly become conditioned and accustomed to seeing and reacting to media found in the store, shop or library on an everyday basis. The innocence of today's youth is slowly being destroyed by the subliminal messages found in music, magazines and movies. The messages are all the same in every type of media: sex, drugs and violence. The world of music has changed so much over the past few decades. We go from jazz, disco, funk, rock, hard rock, to hip-hop / rap. All of these types belong to a certain decade. But in our time, the music industry is exploding with rap and hip-hop. This type of music is triggered towards the three ideas of sex, drugs and violence. Almost every song you hear on the radio or on your iPod today will probably have something to do with one of these three. The feeling of being so naive and so innocent is shattered after listening to these songs every time the radio is on. Young people don't need to listen to this at all and therefore parents should be more aware of what their children are listening to and should think more about the effect the media has on them. Recently, more and more people are turning to articles and book segments to read instead of " good old fashioned " novels . The novels that were written before our era are clean and not self-explanatory. But today, literature has taken a new direction. More and more, @ ORGANIZATION1 companies are becoming less traditional and more direct on subjects related to sexuality, violence or drugs. For example, in @ ORGANIZATION1 you will see articles relating strictly to actions of a sexual nature. Perhaps on the other side of the page you will see an advertisement for @ CAPS1 cigarettes. Soon children will think that everything they see and look will be fine and soon act on it. Libraries that offer these magazines for hire should prohibit children from reading them due to the lack of modesty and morals found in these magazines. There has always been a feeling of a subliminal message throughout the development and evolution of the cinematic world of films. Movies are a timeless object of entertainment. But recently, the subtle or straightforward " clues " of sex, drugs, and violence are featured in nearly every box office movie available today. There have been those action-packed movies where it's all the fighting and the gore and the punching. Then there are the Sap movies where all the main characters seem to do is have some emotional fights that are soon resolved with a session of steamy sex actions. These types of films are offered in libraries across the country and are easily accessible to children. Young people in our country do not need to see all these actions and hear these messages. In no case is the shape or form morally correct. Overall, library censorship is very low. The people who organize and let this kind of media float for kids to pick up have moral issues that need to be checked. The more a child reads, listens to, or watches media with subliminal or direct messages about sex, drugs and violence, the more they will think it is okay to take action and do these actions. All sense of innocence is destroyed and children are no longer children

Why would you want to censor anything in a library ? Apparently because things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. can be found offensive. If something is considered offensive, why put it in a library anyway if it's going to be open to everyone, including kids? First of all, censorship is important, but we don't need it in libraries everywhere. Libraries are a place where all kinds of literature come together in one place where it can be seen and read by those who admire literature. Censorship puts an end to this by removing books from the shelves because they are considered offensive. If a book is offensive, decide first to what type of audience it would be offensive to. Then decide whether or not it's offensive, even to an adult audience. If it is found to be offensive to an adult audience, it should be removed from the shelves of a library. Otherwise, it should be placed in the adult section of the library. Libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other literary works. As mentioned earlier, if a book is too offensive to someone who is not an adult audience, it should be placed in an adult section. Books suitable for children should be put in the children's section. You can even have such a section for young adults for books suitable for teenagers. Sections of a library almost completely eliminate the need for censorship. Sections help place books and other literary works correctly in a library so that only readers of certain appropriate ages @ MONTH1 will read them. In conclusion, sections of a library can be used in place of censorship. If we were to censor the books that were on the shelves of a library, there would ultimately be hardly any books for anyone. Sections help keep books in a library, but keep them somewhere the right audience can see them

As a student in a public school, the libraries that I and many other students have access to are censored to some extent. Our library being censored, I don't think the public library should be. Why is censorship a conflict to be discussed ? every book found on a shelf is history, so every author who was good enough to publish should be able to have their book on a shelf. While school libraries are already censored for their age group; I think public libraries shouldn't be censored for the simple reason that you, your keeper, but also the library have control over what they deem age appropriate. If disliking the book is a problem ; then put it back. Find something more common for your own benefit. Some things @ MONTH1 are considered inappropriate like a lot of things, but at the same time, each person has their own limits to this. While someone @ MONTH1 dislikes a teen magazine because of its effects on young people, another @ MONTH1 finds it inspiring. If each person found a way to assess things according to their own tastes, there would be nothing on the shelves; as Katherine Paterson put it in her quote. When you enter a public library ; it is divided into sections according to interest, age, author, etc. When you walk into a school library, it is done according to fiction, non-fiction, and author. Censorship between public libraries is not necessary. Adults, students and children all use a public library. So, in the case of @ MONTH1, why are you censoring a library that is suitable for all ages. I think so, a school library @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2 should not contain the same content as a school library @ CAPS3. But a public library is for the public. Indicate the name. In conclusion, if even more censorship were exercised on public libraries, libraries would be used less than they already are. Some of the content in public libraries is not found in school libraries, but adults would also not be able to find the content necessary for their own interests, jobs or even education. So, as the fact @ MONTH1 is that some things @ MONTH1 seem inappropriate for certain age groups, it may help someone in a completely different age group.

Personally, I believe there shouldn't be a lot of censorship in libraries except for things like total smut and pornography. However, there are many different beliefs about it. Some parents @ MONTH1 think it's necessary to control every piece of information a child collects, while others are more forgiving. The main conflict with this question is how different everyone's restrictions are. Many parents believe that if politically incorrect information gets into their child, he / she will be corrupted for life, but that is completely wrong. These days almost everyone goes through something traumatic, witnesses something illegal, gets involved in drama, sexually experiences and / or experiences drugs. The truth is, it's everywhere, and your kids have experienced it and are used to it. Reading a book with a few curses here and there, or an intimate moment is not going to ruin your child, as there is a good chance he / she will already do so in real life. This @ MONTH1 even happens in your own home and there is nothing that can be done to stop it. Trying to control our lives as if it were your own makes children rebel even more when the opportunity presents itself. I'm saying don't worry about censorship in libraries except for the obvious things like pornography, sex novels, racist books, etc. Maybe if we stopped hiding so much from the more mature teens and stopped treating them like toddlers, they wouldn't go looking for all the “ bad ” things out there as much. Parents need to stop thinking that they can trick their child into thinking that there is nothing wrong in the world. If they are not aware of the mistakes that can be made and the consequences that flow from them, they will not know what to do if they find themselves in a situation similar to that of one of the characters in one of these books " offensive ”.

Offensive @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1. Books, music, magazines, films, advertisements. Is it fair to show all types of @ CAPS1 at all ages ? I do not agree. Various people might be offended by the content of this @ CAPS1. I think there should be a designated area, or all alarming @ CAPS1 should be removed so everyone can be at peace when they are in the library, or just watching TV in their room. clean house. Even though some people @ MONTH1 don't take offense at any type of @ CAPS1, you have to think about parents. A majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that @ CAPS1 brings. Some @ MONTH1 content is not suitable for young children. Whether it's going to the movies or just going to the library, kids can see all the violence and bad behavior happening in the world today. I believe that drugs, alcohol and swear words have a big influence on children these days. I think it is our responsibility to protect them until they are at an age where they can make their own judgments. Religion. Our religion plays a big part in what we think is right or wrong. I have been taught to always treat people with respect and to do my best to get along with others. A lot of @ CAPS1 contradict what I have been taught. If you see something on TV with your favorite actor or actress on it, we tend to think of it as acceptable behavior. If you've ever been to a movie theater, you know they have certain ratings. The ratings are there to keep young children from getting into adult movies. They apply this rule to some extent, but I don't think they apply it enough. At the very least, libraries and movie rental locations could have a designated area for adult content to respect those who disagree. A few years ago, when my little sister was about two or three years old, she was watching a movie with me and there were a few curses in it. She had never heard them so often and wasn't sure what they meant. For the next two days, she went to say the word and my parents were not very happy. She had no idea she was doing something wrong because she had heard it in a movie and if they could say it then she could too. Sometimes children don't know any better and if they happened to tell a stranger they would be offended. @ CAPS1 can be harmless, but it can also be offensive. The surest way to keep the new generation respectful is to protect them when they are young so that they can learn what is right and what is not. When they step out into the real world, they won't be hard to put up with and will have good manners. No one will ever agree on the same things, but at the end of the day we have to do what is right for the betterment of our community.

The book called @ CAPS1. the book is about a young man @ CAPS2- @ CAPS3 starting school at @ ORGANIZATION1. During the first few weeks at school, he is harassed and ridiculed. So one day he joined a boxing class and his school's wrestling team. But by the end of the book, he ends up fighting everyone who harassed him. Personally, the book should be kept with you because it is a life changing experience for a young man. For some people this book they will have read or even read this book several times, I know I have. I just hope that other people will like or like this book as much as I do. So I guess what I'm trying to say is you really never know what you're going to love into until we sit there and read it from start to finish.

When you go to a library, have you ever seen the many topics that people write about? Some from their own experience and others made up. Personally, I don't agree that books, music, movies, magazines, etc. offensive should be removed. The authors or producers of this kind of entertainment were made to be read, heard or watched by people who are interested in it! Additionally, if libraries have difficulty with complaints about offensive material, they should simply create a separate section. To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced for? Easy! To entertain us; expand our knowledge of things; to interest us. If none of these things were invented life would be boring, now I'm not saying we need these offensive materials, I'm saying they're there so we can think more broadly about the subjects instead of them. same. The producer has produced "offensive" material to attract attention and be read, not so that they can sit at the back of the library where no one goes just because there are things others @ MONTHS1 do not like. If you don't like that stuff, stay away from them, don't bother reading or listening to them! Why should libraries prevent the people who did these things from making money? Does that sound fair to you? It's bad enough that they wonder if they're good enough to be worthy of shelving. There are a lot of books that are awful and a waste of time to read, so should they be deleted? Think about that one. Second, I don't agree with removing this type of material as libraries could always create a separate section. This @ MONTH1 costs money, but what better way to waste tons of costermers or find some extra space? The libraries are already very big and I'm sure they could find a little more room, they already separate everything into genres. Although I see where the others are coming from to remove this kind of material from the shelves. There are @ MONTH1 cautious parents who don't want their children exposed to this stuff. Teenagers in particular, they @ MONTH1 have ideas about language and scenes of that stuff. I once read the story of a man who read a book that one of his old college buddies wrote about killing women and struggling, this man came up with the idea to do it to his mother. He beat his mother and cut her body open, leaving the inside on the outside lawn. The man is now in prison and the book has been removed from the shelves. Still, I don't think it should have been deleted because some immature, ignorant person thought it would be cool to do so. The book was invented and the guy was most likely delusional and sick in his head for doing it. And because of his actions, the author has to suffer for lost money and great waste of his time and efforts. In conclusion, no type of material should be removed as it has been deemed offensive. Some people are simply ignorant of the fact that they do not understand that books, music, or movies were intended for the entertainment of those who enjoy these kinds of things on display. As I said recently, it was designed to be read; understood; or watched. A separate section would be a great idea.

All the terms of the offense are based on an opinion. If one person finds a word offensive, that doesn't mean the next person will feel the same way. Some parents aren't as strict with their kids as others, and some don't care. Of course, there's always that gangster rap about drugs and objectified women that kids really don't need to listen to. Horror movies that are rated '@ CAPS1' for a reason, they could create nightmares for weeks. Children's mental states are not fully developed at a young age like ten. They still can't tell what's real and what isn't. They need a trusted adult who they can rely on to tell them how to feel, act, do, even think. Children are simply not mature enough to handle a majority of the material in this world. No book should be taken away or hidden from society, it should simply be given to you for your own disgression. Another possibility would be for a group of many people to come together and vote on age restrictions for particular material. All information is useful, but not all is necessary. Nowadays, it is difficult to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers. This world is becoming less and less sensitive every day. Eventually, everyone will be completely immune to all " harmful " movies, books, amgazines, @ CAPS2 shows, and music . It won't even put anyone in phase anymore.

Censorship in libraries is a good thing to have and something bad to have. I think there might be things that adults can read and things that children can read. You don't want kids reading something that's too mature for them, do you ? Libraries can be found all over @ LOCATION1. Lots of people say, "@ CAPS1, well, they shouldn't even have the book in there in the first place." @ CAPS2 think about that, maybe you should just keep your kid under control and watch what he is reading. Or option two, don't ask your child to go to a library @ CAPS3. @ CAPS3, let me explain, is @ CAPS3. Which means that the whole community can go and find something. An @ CAPS3 library is supposed to have variety so that everyone can find a book they would like to read. Yes, some things are very inappropriate for children, that doesn't mean we can't have it in a @ CAPS3 library. Just make sure you know what your child is reading. If you do this everything should be fine and your child will be the same. That's what I think of censorship in a library. It's @ CAPS3, so it's supposed to have everything. That everything includes the good and the bad. I think some people just have to live with it. So I honestly believe that libraries as they are should be left alone.

Has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book ? Many people of different beliefs take offense at books that show the negativity of their ideas. When people are offended by a book, the first idea that comes to their mind is to try to get the book off the shelves by censoring it from the libraries. I think if a book offends a certain group of people, they just shouldn't read it. Why shouldn't others have the chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else? Banning books would go against what our country stands for. How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments having the final say on what can and cannot be read? Imagine what life would be like if all the books deemed offensive were removed from our shelves ; there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book. I understand that sometimes things written in books can be really disturbing and offensive, but that doesn't give anyone the right to just take them off the shelves. Censorship of books is a short-term response to a long-term problem. I believe that if we continue to resort to book censorship, we will become a less creative society. There are a lot of people who @ MONTH1 actually want to read a book but never get the chance just because it's library censored. Censored books are generally the books that aid the imagination. Would you like to live in a world where people are devoid of creativity?

To be honest, if I were a librarian I would leave them on the shelves depending on what state law @ MOIS1 has to say. If the state has no problem having them on the shelves, then all students can check them out. having magazines shows what is new in the world and what is not. Also, just like reading a book, you have to pass a test called number of reads. Then you would have to read a one page magazine article and write an essay on it and submit it to whoever is in charge of that department.

Lots of things like books, music, magazines etc. make kids act differently but I'm saying everything should stay in the library because there are more things that cause acts than listed . Many children get their acts from books, movies, and magazines, but most get their acts from something different. Children get most of their acts from the television they watch at home, which leads them to believe that if their parents don't care what they watch, there is nothing wrong with seeing. . at home or at the cinema. So I'm really saying it's okay for kids to read or watch what's legal on TV. But for me, in libraries, it's up to whoever controls it to decide by age. just like legal things only legal for adults. I say it's only for adults because kids start arguing over what they see, especially when they're around their friends. When the kids are with their friends, they think it's cool to do anything. And it all comes from things based on violence in the books that children read more often. So for me I will say that should not be correct for what is seen.

I have read a few books that I don't approve of. And I think so, I have the right to take these books off the shelves. But who to say what I think should have an effect. Honestly, I don't think books should be taken off the shelves or music should be banned etc. of this nature. I wouldn't want my child to walk out of the library with a book about sex, gangs, or things a child shouldn't know. Instead of banning or removing these kinds of books from the shelves, why not put a strict age limit on books and stick to it. Yes there is an adult section, a kids section etc, but I have seen so many young children hanging out with books, magazines, and other adult stuff. I know what it feels like to try to focus on a book, newspaper, or magazine that interests you when people are screaming at headphones. And I still feel the same for music as I do for books. Don't ban it from the library, just ban it from certain areas of the library. All this out of respect for people who want to be in a quiet area. I'm not the type who wants to take things away from people because everyone has their own interests and beliefs in life, but I am one of those who believe in making rules. I see good things going out of all a library has to offer if only it could exclude things in certain areas. And also to set and respect the age limits of the books being audited.

They should be deleted out loud as some books are offensive. Even though they are offensive, they can teach young teens about their past. The books could be on kkk or @ ORGANIZATION1. Some young teens like to read books like this to learn and see what people have thrown away. Books could be a school assignment. In my opinion, if your teenager is interested in history or violence from the past, you should allow him to read whatever he wants. Some books like @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS6 are great for homework reading. These @ CAPS6 books are very useful to read because you can learn more about your history and the wars at the same time. I think if your child takes a book from the library, he or she should return it in a week. The library should give the child some time to return the book. If the child does not return the book within this time, he or she must invoice it for each day of delay. If the book is damaged, they blame the person who has already checked that book. The book must be in the condition it was in when it left so that other people can check it after it returns. the library should keep some books in the library such as the bible and collage books. The library should allow @ CAPS6 books for each person. Instead of three or four, that would keep the books on the shelves. It would also prevent people from losing pounds. I think people under 20 @ CAPS3 shouldn't be out loud when watching movies or music. I think they should have to show some ID to prove that there are more than twenty @ CAPS3. there should be more rules than just leaving the library, they should force people to start keeping books in the library and only allow them to take @ CAPS3 or @ CAPS6 books home. For example, I check the @ CAPS3 book every week and return the @ CAPS3 that I viewed on the same day I go to look for a new @ CAPS3. I only look at the book I really want to read, read it and return it. Magazines should never be checked out.

I think they shouldn't be taken off the shelves because everyone has different opinions. one person @ MONTH1 thinks a book is offensive but the next one @ MONTH1 does not. Some people @ MONTH1 think that all books with god or jesus are offensive, but @ MONTH1 is offensive just because there is no religion. If each person took away a book that they found offensive, there would be no more books. Because people think differently. Or some @ MONTH1 don't like @ PERSON1's books because of the violence and violence, but for some people these are favorite books so it would be unfair to those who like books that others don't not like. There are a lot of books out there that not everyone will like the difference is how you think and what you think is right and wrong.

Censorship in libraries? It is a problem? Should we solve this "problem" or is it for the good? People of different cultures, origins and lives could be deepened by these articles in the readings. Can these books be offensive? They might be offensive to some, but to others only educational. Statements have been made all over the world of people talking about what they think is right and wrong. How many people think that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries? Who are the real victims when books and magazines are thrown off the shelves? The author of this specific article who's who. If it says that every offensive reading should be taken off the shelves, then what will be left of it. Some people @ MONTH1 consider romances to be offensive or comical or horror. Romance can be hurtful to someone just because they might just be out of a relationship, or comedy because they are unhappy and no longer know how to laugh or what happiness is. Who knows? Such opinions would only be terrible for business, but also terrible for the educational and historical part of life itself. People of different races and cultures @ MONTH1 have a different take on the censorship situation. From all over the world, there are cultures that are spreading everywhere. Being born into a religion can have a huge impact on the outcome of a book, magazine or movie. Films of past experiences or massacres that happened to a culture @ MONTH1 are difficult for some people of that culture to understand. The normal response to a movie like this would be to get angry or frustrated. Only for others it is an opportunity to learn what these people went through and mourn the loss of these people during this time. Support the people who went through these heartbreaking times and become their friends and learn more about them, their culture and their way of life. Have you seen protests rise before you? Around the world? On TV, listen to it on the radio or see it in the newspaper. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack against another person's opinion. There have been protests in the past against the freedoms of a person or even a race. If everyone starts complaining and arguing about what's on the library shelves. What will happen to our world? What will we know from the past? What will we begin to predict for the future? Anyone, even I, can comment on the acts going on around us. In my experience, I have seen attacks on people who only put one photo in the newspaper, or a small article was shown on television. Who are we to say that everything must be removed from the shelves of libraries? These are just people who have been hurt and who do not want to relive that experience. Overall, my opinion on whether library censorship should be turned off. I believe the answer is no, every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt or broken about something at least a million times in their life from now on. Whether it's in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else. They just need to understand that without a person's culture there would be no life story before us.

As @ CAPS1, we have the right to say whatever we want and to do so as long as it complies with the laws. If they take away books because they are racy or because some people find them bogus, then they are saying that we should not be learning the history of our civilization. A great man once said "@ CAPS2 who does not learn from the past is doomed to repeat it". @ CAPS3 says if we take away the books that are even obscured, we take this story away from our children and they will make the same mistakes that we made in our lives. Removing content that is obsessive will make our children ignorant of whether it happened or what the past really was. '@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5's @ CAPS6' is criticized for using the '@ CAPS7-word' a lot in the text. There's no reason to change the book because that's how people spoke back then and how things were done. If they change the book, they change the story, and they take tomorrow's children away from the knowledge that slavery was a tough, tough thing. When I think of censorship in the library I think of how @ ORGANIZATION1 is trying to change the past and how it tries to feed children's history what really happened. Censorship should be on TV, movies, and music so that little kids don't see the bad things to count, but when it comes to literature in the library, they shouldn't do it at all because only the literati will know what it means and what the text really says. There should be no censorship in the literature of the past, present and future.

In my way of looking at it, I say that what I think is that the book, the movies, the music and the magazines should be placed in a critical order because some of us want or like to read or seeing things about what we want to see as the news that is somehow good for us, but others like to see what is behind reality and want to speak out, but they can because they are afraid of being hurt if they speak out. So I think these things (books, music, movies, magazines) shouldn't be taken off the shelves because these books or movies can bring you what is going on in the world and how affects us not to pay attention to it. Some experiences I have is music, I have heard a song in Spanish called '@ CAPS1 The @ CAPS2' before and it talks about the corruption at @ LOCATION1 and how people down below are suffering at because of the people above. watch out for them, also if you treat them like kings they will treat you like slaves, and if you give them the @ CAPS2 to control you they will take advantage, how honest people work hard to bring food to their families. houses, but it's not enough because of the leaders at the top who want it all for them ... it's a really good song that tells the truth and nobody does anything to end it. So I don't want those songs or books that show reality disappears because some people don't like them at all

I believe that everyone's opinion deserves to be fairly publicized. Just because one person's opinion is seen to be right doesn't mean another is wrong. What is offensive to one person @ MONTH1 should be informative to another. I've read a lot of books that parents @ MOIS1 don't choose for their kids. As I read these books, I see that there is no glamor in using drugs or being in trouble with the law. For some teens, books like these can show them the side of life they never knew and find they never want to. If a book is too self-explanatory for the kids, just move the book to another section. I realize that there are books with graphic sexual details, and these should only be allowed to be viewed by adults. Parents should be concerned about the innocence of their children. But I also believe that they should watch the type of books they read and watch out for their vulgarity. Some @ CAPS1 contain name calling or sexual abuse, some contain praise and worship, others even have screaming. Anyone can find any of these types of music offensive. It doesn't mean running away and hiding them all. There would be no more @ CAPS1. Not everyone has the same opinions in this world, so there should be equal opportunities for people to read, watch, or listen to whatever is convenient for them. I'm not saying there should be a stock of porn in the library, but if there are any movies or books about religions or rejected beliefs, they should be just as welcome as those on religions and common beliefs. Everyone finds different things offensive. If there was a bible in the library and someone found it offensive, should it be deleted? It is one of the most popular books in the world, but some people still take offense. Someone who is a Mormon, Muslim, or atheist might find it offensive if there is nothing in the library about them because some people find it offensive. The library is a place of knowledge, not of judgment. I don't believe there are books that should be taken out of the library if they offend someone. If you don't like something that's in the library, don't rent it. If you don't want your kids to do this, don't let them. As simple as that. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. Authors express themselves through books and articles, directors through films and musicians through their music.

I believe if he has offensive language he shouldn't be left out. Also, it really matters if there is offensive language because you don't know who, where, when your child is going to learn offensive words. Another thing he is going to say is offensive words. Then one of the most important things is that if you want your child to never have offensive language or anything else bad, you should watch what you say, what you do. One of the reasons is that once he grows up he might follow in your footsteps. Another thing is that if the magazine, movie, book, etc., can have something interesting like judging the person where they are from, what they look like, how they speak, etc., can be found in a bad situation. In conclusion, what I am trying to say is both the parents and the book as the book your child has chosen could be a bad thing and the parents should be watching them on their own for how they are acting. .

Every parent wants to protect the innocence of their child. They don't want their children to come into contact with things that might influence their decisions. The truth is though that they will eventually run into this stuff, whether it's other kids at school, what they see on TV, or what they see on @ CAPS1. It's their choice as to what decisions they're going to make, so I don't think libraries should be censored because of the content of the material. One of the reasons libraries shouldn't be censored is that no one is forcing a person to pick up material that might have offensive content. It's all about choice. There are many other options on the shelves that do not include such topics. Some people @ MONTH1 want to read or watch something with such content. It would not be fair to them to remove these pieces from the libraries. People should be able to read or watch whatever they want. Censorship of libraries would deprive these people of their right to such matters. Another reason why libraries shouldn't be censored is that there would ultimately be nothing left. As Katherine Paterson said, “And then we don't have any more books on the shelves for any of us. @ CAPS2 is a very true statement. After censorship, people might still think the topics are inappropriate, and libraries would have to be censored over and over again until nothing is left. People will eventually no longer be able to use libraries. Losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to this resource. A final reason why libraries shouldn't be censored is difference of opinion. What @ MONTH1 is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another. How should we get rid of what should not be decided ? It would be much easier to let people make their own decisions about what to read and watch and what not. No one is forcing people to take a book or magazine that is going to offend them. If you don't like what is being discussed, don't read it or watch it. It's that simple. There are many other reasons why library content shouldn't be censored, but here are three obvious reasons. Censorship of libraries will take away a person's choice. This will cause problems, as to what is appropriate and what is not. Eventually, the libraries will have nothing. Of course, all parents want to protect their child, but eventually they will grow up and have to make their own choices. Censorship of libraries will not prevent children from learning shocking things. All you can do as a parent is raise her well and hope you have taught her right from wrong.

I believe that censorship of certain offensive documents, books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from people who have not yet matured, unless a parent or guardian approves it. I think censorship can be a positive thing for little kids and younger kids because kids who are young shouldn't see or listen to things like bad things. These things can have a negative influence on the character and personality of the child. No one should hear other children swearing in public, as this may cause other children to do the same. I know my parents don't want to hear me say or do bad things with my younger siblings because it can influence them more to do it too than if a child said or did bad things. Some censorship shouldn't be said out loud for those who are mature, like in high school where you have to get a parent's signature to see some things that shouldn't be shown to small children because older people have to. matured and they understand why not be a bad influence on people. Censorship of certain offensive documents, books, music magazines, etc., should be withdrawn from those who have not yet matured, except with the consent of their parents. People who have not matured should not see or listen to anything that has a negative influence on themselves.

Everyone loves to take their little kids to the library and pick out all kinds of books to read, but what if your kid picks up that book which, let's say, just isn't what you want? he reads. So what do you do ? Take the book from them? Look for more and let it happen ? Well, you can't blame the library for having the book. Or say you see books you don't like on the shelves at @ ORGANIZATION1. Not just books, but music or movies. Even if you find it offensive, someone else might not. This shouldn't be a big deal at all as not everyone thinks the same way, some of those books, music, or movies might have great information for others, and every book, music, or movie has its own. goal. Although you don't see it every time @ MONTH1, it's something you don't like. Wow, the world would be so boring if everyone liked the same music, read the same books, or just watched the same movie over and over again. Everyone has the right to choose what they like and like to watch, read or listen to. Libraries and stores should also be allowed to put whatever they want on their shelves. Yes, some things are not suitable for others, like the younger ones, but it doesn't matter. As a parent, you need to do your best to keep them away from things you don't want them to see or hear. Another thing is, just because you don't like something or think it's stupid doesn't mean another person doesn't like it! Your average teenager won't want to read about building a house or listen to music from @ NUM1, but does that mean stores shouldn't be selling them ? Everyone has different tastes, like in music. Most young people these days start to listen to fast rap music. That their parents swear up and down, you can't understand. Although in relation some of these songs have a great meaning for us teenagers. Finally, every song, book or movie has a meaning. Not everyone will see the meaning, but it is there. Everyone has their opinion. Libraries or stores should not take things off on their own just because a person thinks it is not appropriate.

I believe that people should not be able to take out books, movies, magazines, etc. library shelves. If someone finds a movie, book or magazine to be offensive, they should contact the other person there and can complain or give their opinion. Even if someone finds that someone is working the wrong way, people have their own opinions and thoughts about everything in life and are allowed to express their feelings and disbelief. In addition, people can read the front or back of other people's work that summarizes the subject of the work or what the work is about. People can then decide whether they want to read or look further. Everyone in this country is allowed to say what they think and if someone takes the time to get their voice published, others might want to hear what others are thinking. People can disagree, no one has to agree with everything someone says. It's okay to disagree with what another person is saying, but everyone has a right to stand up and say what they think about the situation. For example, if my coaches told me that they think I am doing something wrong in gymnastics or that they think something is wrong when I do it, I let them speak. I let them tell me what they think would be nicer or give more points. Then once they are done talking I give my opinion and say "@ CAPS1 I think this because that" I try to reason with them. For one it is more respectful and for two each can have their own thoughts on something. And who knows, they might be right if you give them the chance to speak. But, if you really don't like what another piece of work might say, you still can't read what they wrote, or watch what they produced. You don't have to be rude. If you strongly disagree you can always write your own book or publish an article expressing your own thoughts, that way someone can disagree or agree with what you think about a certain topic. That's why I think they should keep all the books, magazines, movies on shelves. Everyone is allowed to speak up and explain their actions on a certain topic. Sincerely, @ PERSON1

To whom it concerns @ MONTH1 : The idea of censoring books, music, films or anything else in libraries or the public is very offensive. There are many things that can appear “offensive” to any individual. Taking books or anything off the shelf because someone felt it was wrong with their morals or beliefs is against the writer's freedom of expression. It can also trigger serious problems with religious groups or people of different ideas. It also shows that the library, or to the extent of the country, is subject to a certain idea and that other ideas that conflict with it will be oppressed. One of the biggest concerns is that freedom of speech is being suppressed. It's @ MONTH1 something as trivial as '@ CAPS1's @ PERSON1?' now, but if people keep taking books off the shelves because they find something wrong there, then our freedom is taken away. " @ PERSON1 from @ CAPS1 ? " Was raised because a mother had actually obtained a Book @ CAPS1's @ PERSON1? ' @ CAPS4 taken off the shelf, because her child was afraid of the halloween edition. The fact that something can be banned for something so trivial is a scary thought. There weren't many instances of this specific @ PERSON1 scene spooking all kids, so there was no need to have it banned. When someone finds something even a little wrong, they want it to be banned and dumped, never to be allowed to be shown again to those who @ MONTH1 find even an interest in it. One great thing that @ MONTH1 conflicts with censorship is the idea of religion. The @ CAPS5 is a published work, whether religious or not. Who says it can't be banned? What if someone from another religion found this very offensive? This could cause even more conflict between religious parties, and in turn anything religious would be banned as a whole. This small and weak border between state and religion will blur only because of censorship. If @ CAPS5 or works for Catholics are banned, then so could works published for Wiccans, Muslims, Buddhists and any other source of religion. There would be no comfort for a religious or spiritual person. Not to mention the fear that some publishers or authors will have when publishing their works. This will then become a subject that is much less talked about, as they would be afraid of getting into legal or social trouble for expressing their thoughts and feelings with their spirituality or religion. This censorship will only cause future problems. This could lead not only to a ban on religious books, but anything that deviates from social norms. If anyone was homophobic, @ MONTH1 will start banning work by a gay author, or just a book on the @ CAPS7 community. That little sense of security that members of this community have in these books will be removed. Personally, I find solace and my sense of being alone is blunted by these books. There is even @ MONTH1 a possibility that some books, not necessarily just the @ CAPS7 books, are preventing someone from coming out of that chasm of depression they are so close to. It is a world that someone likes to enter, hide or confide in. Taking someone's mental safety is worse than taking their physical safety. Most people don't realize what kind of trouble they're going to start with censorship. That @ MONTH1 doesn't mean anything, but those who decide whether or not to censor something should think about the picture as a whole ; Are they losing customers because they keep them on the shelves ? Or do they lose clients and stop giving the right to free speech ? It's a heavy decision to make but the decision could make or break the publishing group or the legal part.

Devin @ NUM1 @ NUM2 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 Do you like the library? There is always a debate about how books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelves if people find them offensive. Which brings me to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 ; there is always the choice of a different library to choose from. You also don't have to watch the book or watch the movie. As an @ CAPS3 author you have freedom of expression, you can write whatever you feel like writing. First and foremost, is your choice of library. There are several different libraries in the same city. Some have children's sections where all of the books are appropriate for young children to read. In addition, parents of children should keep an eye on what their child is going to read or watch. There must be at least twenty to thirty libraries in @ LOCATION1, so you always have a different option. Second, you don't have to read the book or watch the movie. If you see something in the book that you don't like, why are you complaining? Just put the book down, someone else might be interested in the book. You have the freedom to choose the book. Finally, the freedom of expression of the author of the book. As a citizen @ CAPS3, you have the right to write whatever you want to write. So people don't have the right to blame the author for what he writes. Many people have been inspired by certain books which have been controversial throughout history. What would we be without these books and authors? I gave you three reasons for the @ CAPS1 view of censorship in libraries. You have the choice of libraries, you don't have to read the book and the author has the freedom to write whatever he wants.

Hiding @ CAPS1 ? By: @ PERSON1 in the harsh world we all live in, I don't believe it is morally correct for a program of any kind to hide the harsh reality of our world from anyone. @ CAPS1 will be @ CAPS1 and you should never hide what is true in the eyes of another person's mind. If a person chooses to close their eyes and enter an imaginary world, then it is their right as a human being. However, a man does not have the right in any case to close another person's eyes for him. Personally, I am not afraid to delve into the history of man's choices and shoulder the burden of the hard knowledge I have inherited. I consider the human race on this planet to be whole and to be with each other. This planet does not belong to any race, nation or culture of people; it belongs to each person equally. I made the decision to take responsibility for knowing the past and using its lessons to improve the future. This world belongs to me as much as it belongs to you; so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me. That being said, each person's decisions impact everyone, not just yourself. People think we should hide things that are “ offensive ” to others. Racism, global political issues, victims of war and personal ethics are some of these “ offensive ” things . Yet, offensive or not, these subjects are very real and alive in our world; So why should anyone have the right to try to suppress these topics for another person? In @ LOCATION1 everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression, but how can these freedoms be exercised if people remove these expressed ideas and beliefs from readers' shelves ? We all have the right to make the decisions that affect our world and if this world belongs to everyone equally, then everyone's decisions are weighed down by everyone as well. That being said, we all have a right to know the decisions, actions and consequences of those decisions and actions that our people all create every day. In conclusion, I believe that our world is hard and also beautiful. Being who he is, I believe that every man has the right to live and decide as he wants. No man should ever make someone else's decisions for him. Everyone is responsible for their own life and for how their life affects others. However, no one has the responsibility to hide or change the world around us from anyone, for it is the knowledge of people that makes the world what it is and it is the knowledge of the world that influences decisions. of somebody.

author Ketherine Paterson is like letting you know life is not going to unfold, go ahead and take the book off the shelf for you and your kids because most of the books are gone because of d others have had them. I would go to the library and take the book from the shelf for myself and my children. mom can get good books for kids like a book that contains body parts so that they can start learning something not rite that they are small and that they will start to make sentences. to remove everything from the library because people haven't checked out books, music, movies, megazines, etc. bring out something for their children so that they can start reading to learn something from their mother's school. in my opinion if i was the principal of the school i wouldn't take the books about the library i would live everything so they can take the books off the shelf and check them so the kids start learning to read, they want to learn something special from their mom.

Dear @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 I have found that there is strong censorship in libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement with these actions. I have found things to have been taken off your shelves due to its contents. Some content is vulgar and self-explanatory and some is very offensive, but it still does not give you the right to remove such material. Books, movies, music, and magazines are a very big part of people's lives and taking these things out can be a big part of a person's development. First of all, under no circumstances should you remove books from the shelves. There is a reason why these books were written and published and that is because they make sense and can teach people or give them information about things that they otherwise would not know. Taking books off the shelves is pretty much just protecting people, especially children, from information that would benefit them no matter what. Yes, some books are about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms, but unless kids are exposed to such things, they won't know it's wrong. If they don't read books about how slaves were treated, they'll never know about slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the meaning of cheating. When people read these things, they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can figure out that these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @ CAPS1 under any circumstances, and films should be viewed the same. Movies now a day have come along the way. Movies like @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS4 use such an advanced form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can understand that I don't want a little child to see that. This does not mean, however, that these items should be deleted from @ CAPS1. In all honesty, I don't want my little brother or sister to walk past a @ CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I think no one else is okay with that . However, other films should be on display for children to rent. Films that can teach them history although there is a very graphic content. Films that will help them learn not to commit acts like murder or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think movies that go beyond that should be placed in an adults only section and I don't think any porn should be exhibited anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very large extent. Films are great educational tools and magazines follow the same path. In today's world we have magazines like @ ORGANIZATION1 which are full of information that can help children from an early age to even people who have been out of school for quite some time. I feel like some @ MONTH1 educational magazines are graphic and show things kids shouldn't see, but on the other hand seeing it will help them understand. Now I'm not saying I want to expose @ CAPS6 magazines for people to see and learn what little clothes some girls can wear, but @ MONTH1 magazines show the very small amount of clothes people are forced to wear in the countries of @ LOCATION1. They should be able to see magazines that might show, a little more naked, people starving because they can only eat twice a week. Things like this can be very offensive, perhaps to some people, because they can teach. This will show the children that these people need help and that they can be those people who help them. Again, porn shouldn't be available all the time, but other magazines that have an educational approach but might contain naughty stuff due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available, but on the other hand, you need to take a more careful approach to music. Music is probably the most difficult to understand, of those censored things that I spoke about today. People use music to express their feelings. Whether these feelings are good or bad, they express them through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be removed from people entering an @ CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything else. There is something called the "clean" version of almost any song that contains swear words. Songs that can't be cleaned up or that aren't available that way, I can understand why they're being taken off the shelves, but other than that I think everything should be available. Music can be so powerful for people and taking it out is not the right thing to do. In conclusion, censorship should not be done. Yes, there are things that need to be removed due to the extreme character it contains, but if there is anything that can be learned, I feel like it should stick around no matter what. People go to a @ CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines and books can be such a big part of people's lives and taking these things away from them is not fair.

Have you ever read something that drove you crazy? Well, to be honest, I can't remember the last time I walked into a library and found something there that offended someone. But it's just me, I'm sure there is some stuff out there that could really reach a person. No, I don't think the materials should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive. People go to libraries to find information about things they don't know. If you check something out, you already know that there is a possibility of something you disagree with. I think it should be anyone's business rather than the checker. Now, I'm not the type to get frustrated or upset with something I've seen on a shelf, but I could imagine that there are people out there who are like that. If I had found something that I didn't agree with, I wouldn't read it or just don't think about it. I also think you should be prepared before entering a public place where they have all kinds of readings. To you @ MONTH1 is offensive, to others it is hilarious. Whatever I'm trying to say, don't get upset over something you've read.

I believe books are written for a reason and the words in the book go with the purpose of the book is that the words in the book are to be in the book. But I'm also the type of person who sees words that are too offensive for people to read. But not by far I think not letting people read the books that contain offensive words is a bit silly because the author wants it to be there and if you change one word you sort of change everything. book and what it is to try say. But if some books are too shocking, yeah, I think it's good not to let people read, but to take them off the market, quit the book, and try to resell it. But some people would be upset with the changes we're making because they'll think the book says something different but it's not just worded differently. But I believe in both to keep people reading them and to stay in the market. Why I think it's okay to let books like this go on books that had offensive words, yes it's worn out but it's also worn out for people who don't see it as offensive. I'm sure the author of any book that contains offensive words didn't mean it hurts you. Do I know in my heart that they're sorry for hurting you anyway. But why I think they should stop is because some people would really have a hard time reading offensive wroding, it could be about something that happend to them when they are little or just a word they might not like. But if they come across a word they don't like, they should stop reading. I think it's frowned upon if they take a book down just because there might be a word someone doesn't like. But for others, it doesn't matter to them. I think books that have offensive wording should say somewhere like the back of the book that there should be a warning if there is any offensive work, I think that would help a lot of people who would start doing that. It's really a bit silly because a book is a book and you should always read the story on the back of the book and if it's offensive and you don't like it tell you not to buy the book. Don't always buy a book by the cover as the cover might be with flowers on the front and the book might not be about flowers at all. I really feel like I'm on both sides

Libraries are a center of learning. They are there to provide all kinds of different information. So why should you remove offensive material ? Even before the Internet, the all-knowing source, people depended on the library for research. I don't think we need to take things out of our library. Public libraries have always had a good censorship of @ CAPS1 which they still put on their shelves. As Katherine Paterson once said, “ We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf, this job that I hate, then you have the exact same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. @ CAPS1 she says there are, everyone has some opinion they @ MOIS1 take offense at different things. Therefore, if someone could have the right to remove a book from the shelves that they find offensive, then we would not have any books on our shelves. If we went back to the days when the Internet was not invented, there would be no problem as to whether we should remove certain books from the shelves. That's all they depended on. For example, research and entertainment. People today are spoiled. We can go straight to a small screen and type whatever we want to know and we can figure it out in a matter of minutes, sometimes even seconds. People don't even have to leave their homes to buy the latest movie that just came out, you can order it on the internet or even rent it from @ ORGANIZATION1. If people are so worried about @ CAPS1 being in the library, why don't they worry about all the explicit junk on the internet. Sometimes people can't see @ CAPS1 right in front of them. Whenever I go to the library and browse through the books for something to read, I rarely find a book worth browsing. Libraries are generally healthy businesses, they have good censorship on @ CAPS1 that they leave on their shelves. They always had certain sections of age groups, and generally people and children always stick to their age groups. Every book that I chose too, I read it cover to cover. In conclusion, libraries have always existed. Their material provides research and entertainment appropriate for all ages. No matter if we have ever had the Internet, we have always had reliable libraries.

I think no @ CAPS1, Book, @ CAPS2 or any sort of music should ever be taken off the shelf, if you don't like what they say in those @ NUM1 categories that you don't want to listen to, read or whatever. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean someone else doesn't like it. I mean, think about it, is there a @ CAPS1 or a song or phrase so terrible you have to take it off the shelf, I say no. Also because someone might not have been able to read, see or listen to this song @ CAPS1 or book what I mean. On top of all that money, time and hard work it took to create the song, book, or @ CAPS1, it almost takes @ NUM2 years for a @ CAPS1 to come out and when a song comes out, it's almost nothing new because they never tell you to listen to bullet for my valentine's new song on @ NUM3 or whatever and when a new book comes out it's usually like harry potter or something like that but no, no @ CAPS1 should ever be taken from the shelf or book, music or magizine. @ ORGANIZATION1

There are certain books, games, and music that you and I know that shouldn't be in the library or in stores on the shelves. A word we should study, children. Children are the future, whatever happens in the future will be because of them. Now with that done and said; I would like to explain and stress why we, as members of @ ORGANIZATION1, should overcome together and remove books, music, movies from the shelves. Drugs, crime, violence, movies, etc. Most of the time, rappers rap about women, kill people, etc. That doesn't mean they do, but it spills over to the majority of our children. Music is streamed daily at NUM1 hours on TV, radio and iPods. It even takes him to a different level with the male sex. Calling women by their name by treating them the way they were taught through music. If they don't listen to it, they sure do watch it. Lots of problems come from letting kids watch low- rated movies . The @ CAPS1 rating wants them to now let the kids watch and buy. So now it then gives a greater chance to miss life. So now we're on the ball with this stuff that we allow our kids to pick up off a shelf. # @ NUM2 thing we let them pick up and grab is video games. @ PERCENT1 of our children are playing video games. Although we cannot stop them from making them, I firmly believe that we can prevent children from buying them at their age level. Most of the games are based on sex, drugs, violence and languages. At this point, children take things very seriously and firmly believe that they can do the same. Which leads to death or jail. Drug use, dropping out of school and crime are very high because of those same video games that kids pull off the shelves. By strongly urging them to grow up quickly, ignore the life of childhood. So why can't we do it? I don't understand why we can't do it when we have the power. It will help us a lot for everyone's future. The crime rate will drop, test results will improve, and our future will be brighter. For our good and for our children.

Let's say you walk into a public library and look at a book that is racist or offends you. You think the book shouldn't be on the shelf, so you take it out. I believe you have the right to take this book off the shelf. These aren't just books either; it can be music, movies, magazines or more. Authors have the right to freedom of expression, but it can also go the other way. There are several reasons for this and I will explain it to you. The first reason is that the person might not come back to that place. I mean, if someone walks into a library and tries to find a book to read, do you think they'll ever come back if they're offended by a book? Some time ago I was in the library and noticed a book that offended. He was talking about black jokes. I believe it's not fair because all people are equal no matter what they look like or what they believe. The next reason is that it could lower the material rate. If someone becomes offensive about censored content, they will report it and lower the rate. No library wants to keep any books, music, movies or magazines that have been flagged by their community and no one wants them. What would the author think about their material being reported because of someone becoming offensive ? If the author wants to offend someone, then he shouldn't even bother to publish it. The last reason is to get rid of the materials. No one wants to watch something that offends them. How would you feel if you took a movie home to watch family and it had some bad stuff in it and you didn't like it. You are offended and you complain. Complaining is bad for business, especially if it is about a government building. If we just get rid of the things that offend people, then we wouldn't have a problem. I think there are some documents that should be taken off the shelf if anyone takes offense. There are really three main reasons. One is that the person might never come back to that place. Then it could cause the success rate to drop. The last one is just to get rid of the materials so that they don't complain. Now what do you think

I think censorship within libraries and all other public media sources is bad, immoral and unfair. Authors, artists, photographers, etc. have the right to freedom of expression. Why shouldn't consumers have the same right to choose what they are exposed to? Censorship of any media should not be allowed in public consumer spots, not only because it violates basic American rights, but it also takes away responsibility, originality, and the expression of life. by @ CAPS1. If a parent or guardian does not want their child to be exposed to certain genres of certain media, isn't it their responsibility to intercept that from their child's environment ? If a parent really hates a certain gender, then it's up to them to create an environment in which they feel their child is safe. It's understandable that some genres of music, magazines, books, and movies contain material that @ MONTH1 is too graphic or mature for a reader of a certain age, but situations like this in today's world hui are inevitable. From my experience, I know that when I was too young to understand the events of @ NUM1, my parents intercepted the stories of me. My parents turned off the graphic or violent television when I entered the room. They felt that this type of material was inappropriate for someone aged @ NUM2, so they pulled this material out of my environment. When you become a parent, you take responsibility for another person's life. This responsibility includes the health, safety and environment of the child. Why can't @ LOCATION1 leave the parenting of the children to the parents ? When children grow up to be teens and teens grow into adults, they gain many privileges. They earn the right to drive, then the right to vote, then the right to drink responsibly. There is a level of maturity that goes into making decisions on your own ; if you are mature enough to decide who you want to rule your country, how could you not be mature enough to decide something as trivial as the choice of music? Authors, artists, composers and photographers, all living at @ LOCATION1, all have the right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression. By censoring products published and made public, this right is removed. Some @ MONTH1 argue that artists and writers still have the right to express themselves, but they are voicing material that is too risky or graphic to promote. It's an understandable point, but who is the government to promote only what it wants to promote? Why should the government have full control over @ CAPS1 to which they are exposed ? If this were to happen, could it easily be taken too far by power-hungry politicians? Would @ LOCATION1 no longer be a democracy, but rather a communist country, like @ LOCATION2? American prides itself on being a " mixing pot " and being tolerant. If @ LOCATION1 looked like @ LOCATION2, that would mean countrywide expression and origin restriction. Would you really want to live in a country where originality is not really original, and where acceptance was only what the government deemed acceptable? Would you be proud to live in a place where people do not have the opportunity to express themselves freely to others? I will not do it. Although censorship of media through a library is only small in scale, censorship is censorship. It is discrimination against the composers of a certain kind of work. This is the removal of the choice of lives from @ CAPS1. It is to deny composers their right to freedom of expression. Whichever way you look at it, censorship is censorship, and censorship is bad

Lots of people come to the library to check out books, music, movies, and other things for entertainment. It is mainly children who use the library more than any other age. The library is a place where you can be humble and relaxed. No one wants to check for thoughts that are offensive in any way. Not even books that will influence bad things. Therefore, some things should not be allowed to be checked out in libraries. Some movies shouldn't be in the library. For example, if a child goes to the library, @ MONTH1 sees a movie that contains sexual activity and decides to watch the movie. Child @ MONTH1 is a minor and the film would be considered inappropriate. Child @ MONTH1 is having trouble with his tutor. In reality, it would be the librarian's fault to let the child watch the film. That is why films should be censored. On the covers of many magazines, the bodies of women and men are exhibited. This @ MONTH1 draws children to the magazine. They @ MONTH1 even decided to check out the magazine. Children are influenced by the things they see. Seeing naked bodies would be considered a bad example. In today's world, all children listen to music. The music you listen to has a huge impact on your life. Music in libraries should be censored. Libraries should have music that encourages you to go out and be something in life. In my opinion, only influential music should be able to be praised. Reading is the key to success. Libraries should have books that will help you increase your vocabulary and educate you. Not the books that will talk about sex or even make you wonder about sex. Libraries should only have history, math, and education books. In conclusion, everything in the library should be censored. Lots of children go to the library. Therefore, it should be age-appropriate. No child needs to be subjected to a bad influence. Some ideas should be taken off the shelves to reduce confusion.

I think movies and magazines should be taken off the shelves because they might contain things that small children could watch or watch. Movies and magazines will sometimes give some kids ideas and books should be deleted because there were words people would say and music should be deleted because they have rap music. People shouldn't listen to him. Music is sometimes not suitable for all ages and can give people an idea of what they are saying or doing. Books and magazines can give people an idea of what they say or do, and they can believe anything they say. People should read good books and magazines and listen to good music. They are all offensive because they talk about bad things and bad things or talk about the way they live their life. Peolpe shouldn't listen to rap music or read magazines or read books that will give ideas to others. The books sometimes talk about what happened a long time ago and things like that and sometimes it offends people like that. Magazines sometimes tell people what happened in the past and people don't want to read magazines anymore. People no longer want to listen to music or read books. Most people will think that most books, magazines, and music are bad for children and for adults. I think it's offensive because music is not a good thing to listen to like rap or hip-hop. People shouldn't be listening to rock music and they should just be listening to appropriate music. Books should be suitable for all ages and they should read something they like. They should read magazines that they like and that are good and appropriate. Music is offensive because they talk about inappropriate stuff and they shouldn't listen to it and magazines have inappropriate stuff and books have inappropriate stuff. People won't like it and they might not want to check it again or they won't check anything. I think they should put books on the shelves that people will like and music that people will like. They should put magazines on the shelves that people will want to watch or read

I find this test stupid, I hate to read and write. i think all of you should make sure we can read at bc level and write at bc level a lot of kids aren't even really going to try this test until their school year @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 and also a lot of teachers don't even teach this material until the end of the year so I think some of the things you all test on should be changed like what things you test on and how long the test takes and should be more focused on reading and writing levels, but I don't agree that the test has yet to be here because it helps felter people who passed the class by cheating and went through work, I think it should having a replacement test that is taken on paper because some kids test better on paper then a computer that's how i feel about the test. I know I was supposed to write about offensive material but I couldn't think how I felt about it and this is the stuff that was on my middle so I thought I would let you know what you think many

In the libraries, there are of course books. There are mysteries, romances, comics, biographies, and whatever else you @ MONTH1 can think of. There are also magazines, movies and even CDs that are now in libraries. Then, in the libraries, there are also these books and magazines. These books being the ones I would never pick up on a shelf myself, let alone allow my future children to pick them up. This is because these books contain material which is not at all conducive to the young person's brain. This is why I would like these books to be censored so that my child would never even know the books are there. These books contain people who have sex and who smoke drugs and their language in these books is horrible ! These seem to be the kind of books that interest young children. They read them in school and somehow get them from their friends. They also find them in libraries and the more they read the more they want to do because they are very easily influenced. They are influenced by characters from books that sometimes don't even exist. There are many reasons why I think books should be highlighted, but one of the main reasons is that because young people read these kinds of books, they go out and do what they read in the books. Thinking it's okay because someone who isn't even real most of the time is. I think these books are the reason babies raise babies. Where have we even heard of it, but it does happen and by the time those same kids become freshmen in high school, if they even get there, they take responsibility for the baby they had when they did. were eleven years old. These same children go through life wondering how different their situations could have been ! So I feel like before these books go off and spoil a whole new generation of kids, why don't we stop here ? Why does another child have to get pregnant at the age of ten for someone else to realize it's time for a change? Ten-year-olds are still babies! The human brain is not even fully developed until around the age of twenty-five. So these kids don't know if what they're reading is wrong because they haven't been taught that it's very wrong, it's because at this age no parent expects they have to teach them not to have sex. Why @ MONTH1 you ask, because by the age of ten what kid should know about sex ? At this age they still love to color and play with baby dolls or they love @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3, they should even think about sex let alone know what it is. These materials should be taken off the shelves because children reading or looking at these kinds of books and magazines in libraries should not be happening. Preventing another generation from wasting their lives removing materials is the best solution. After all, shouldn't a parent have the chance to make sure their child doesn't kill their chances of living a happy life in the future?

Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, I recently went through different libraries to see what other types of information they had. I'm also afraid to tell you that I saw a censorship problem with our public libraries. I can understand why they might censor some of the more mature / graphic novels because of kids coming in and out of the library all day, but I don't think everyone should be able to get the books they want because of the content issues. One of the reasons I think there shouldn't be censorship in libraries is that some people need to find information on certain topics and maybe there is no information. reliable about it on the Internet. if high school or college students do not have the information they need to write an article or do a project for their classes, then their marks might go down and they might also fall behind in work because they are trying to catch up with everyone else's work in their class. Another reason I think the censorship in our libraries is because some of the things they censor might be the only copy of the book or the only one near you. If they censor the only book you need, it could potentially ruin the whole book for them. I think if a person has more of @ NUM1 they should be able to pull out any book they want and do it uncensored. some people @ MOIS1 take offense at certain things written in these books, but if they don't like something, they shouldn't check it out in the first place. There are many people in the world who are interested in millions on millions of different topics. Also, some people @ MONTH1 cannot search or explore their topics as much as they would like due to the censorship issue in public libraries. If people could find out more about their interests, they could move on to bigger and better things or maybe even just get a little smarter. In conclusion, I think that censorship in libraries should be banned because of the problems it can cause and the effect it has on people. Censorship is a problem that must be dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Imagine a library without any material that is considered offensive. In this library, you won't find many of the great literary works that have impacted and influenced society @ DATE1. You probably won't find too many books, magazines, or movies that everyone in @ CAPS1 deems appropriate. Some of the great classic novels have content that could be considered offensive to many people. Offensive material should remain in the libraries on DATE1 because something offensive to one person may not be offensive to another, who might be affected by the prohibited work. The music should also stay in the libraries because the artist did not put the lyrics in the song to draw the attention of listeners to the offensive material. Additionally, offensive materials have impacted society for centuries. First, documents that a person finds offensive might be viewed in another way by many other people who appreciate them. Some comedy and action movies are considered offensive or inappropriate to some people, but many others @ MONTH1 enjoy the movie. If a movie, book, or magazine is about @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, it may be considered offensive to the people who are in it, but it may also inform the reader or the viewer of events that have happened. If children want to view or read this material, they must first get permission from their parents. Then all the music must stay in the libraries. The music was created by an artist who made it for fun and entertainment. The purpose of music is not to attract the attention of listeners to offensive content. The lyrics of some songs are inappropriate for children, but parents should not let their child listen to them. Lyrics can deal with really mature things that should only be heard and understood by adults. Finally, offensive materials have had an impact on society for ages. A lot of things the founding fathers of @ LOCATION1 did were considered offensive, but that didn't make them wrong, and it made @ CAPS1 a better place @ DATE1. Offensive materials impact everyday life for better or for worse. If all offensive content was banned, it couldn't have a better impact on @ CAPS1. In conclusion, offensive documents should stay in the @ DATE1 libraries. The @ MONTH1 materials are controversial, but they are still pieces of literature worth reading and studying by the folks at @ CAPS1. Offensive material contains many life teaching aids that could help many people. The @ CAPS1 would become that of @ CAPS1 in @ PERSON1 @ CAPS4 @ NUM1's novel, where all the books were burned and the company was not at all smart, if any offensive material was removed from the @ DATE1 libraries.

I think some books should be banned from libraries which are offensive or use certain words against people, I think this should apply to high school libraries because it would really matter in elementary schools as they wouldn't know not what some things mean. If one class read an offensive book and someone in the class of the opposite race reads the book, the others could be distressed and it could start a fight. Some high school students could get angry faster than others and this could cause a lot of problems so avoiding that there are votes on books that should be banned or not read aloud in class or during school term . I'm pretty sure people would think it's stupid to ban books, but trust me it would solve a lot of problems, but it all comes down to what's okay and what's not without hurting people. others and bring them down. I bet all the time in class there was a story that was read that talked about races that make other people feel uncomfortable, and there's always that person who always tries to make fun of something. thing, but if I was in this situation I would do my best not to let others get to me and interfere with my grades and performance. I would ignore them as much as possible and if it started to get boring I would talk to my counselor to try talking to this person one-on-one or just withdraw from the class. I'm pretty sure most schools wouldn't tolerate this type of behavior, but you will still have these kinds of kids that you just have to ignore. You should never go to school thinking that you are out of place just because someone is making fun of your race or your appearance. They are just trying to make your day harder for you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully that will be taken care of.

Censorship in libraries differs in some areas. Personally, I love to read and I love all kinds of books. And I know there are books that I read that my parents wouldn't approve of. But has it ever stopped me? Not exactly. I think after a certain age people should be out loud to read whatever they want. I mean, if I ever thought I couldn't be mature enough to read a certain book. Then I'm not going to get or read the book, it's that simple. When it comes to music, movies, and magazines, that could be a different story. Much of the music is like a book, just using another of your senses. And it is listened to, not read. Movies should be judged a little more carefully in my eyes, because movies are like showing and telling. It could easily go wrong if kids, teens, etc. make it more than just a movie. I think that all things should not be judged by hypothesis. Everyone has different opinions and tastes. So, therefore, the material should not be taken off the shelves, if there are people who like / support what the book, movie or music has to offer.

What's your first thought when thinking of a library? Is it stillness, peace or calm? A lot of people would think that until they stumbled upon a certain book, magazine, movie, etc. They would start reading and soon read something completely offensive. Books, magazines, films, etc. should be censored and removed from a library if found to be offensive. Even if everyone is entitled to their opinion, I believe that a library is a place of peace. Having offensive literature in a library makes it seem a bit trashy. If people want to read a certain magazine or book that offends a large number of people, then they should go somewhere other than a library to find it. When I was younger, I attended events at our local library; like seeing who could read the most books in a certain amount of time, or other events like that. I loved exploring the library and discovering new things. I remember back then, and even today, there was still a large amount of magazines sitting on you, sorted into their correct sections. Many of them show half-dressed women and men. Now I understand that people like to know what's going on in the real world and be up to date, but I believe they can go elsewhere to find such magazines. Having these offensive magazines in libraries for children to see is not good and could easily upset the parents of the children. Another reason why books, magazines, and the like should be censored is that they @ MONTH1 influence teens to do bad and / or bad things. For example, there are many books about drugs and tobacco. If teens read this, they @ MONTH1 start to think it's okay to do these things. If these kinds of books were to be taken out of libraries then I think the number of bad things that influence teens would be drastically reduced because they won't read them. In my opinion, libraries would be better if books, magazines, movies, etc. were censored. Not only would that make people happier, it would make the world a better place. Plus, if you're looking to read something bad, you shouldn't be looking in a library anyway!

My views on censorship are strong. I think if a book, a movie, etc. discriminates against one or more groups of people, so I think people should at least have a right to have a say in whether it should be on the shelves of a library or not. While the books can also be discriminating, if they are about something that happened in the past that is our country's past, then I think people should have a say in keeping it on track as well. the shelves. If these materials use offensive language or actions to harm or discriminate against this breed, they should be removed from the shelves. If they are part of the history of the world or of our country, then I think they should be left there for future generations to learn and know that these things happened. Most of the material doesn't try to discriminate a race, and if they did, then I don't think it would be in the library in the first place. For me, censorship can go both ways. It really depends on the stuation and the material. Someone might have an opinion that it is offensive, but that does not mean that it is a fact. If the book is popular in the library and a lot of people like to come and read it, then I don't think I would remove the book. People view offensive writing and actions differently from one another. So I think it depends on the situation. If I were a parent these days I would let my child read one of these so called offensive books if it was part of our country's past. My attentions to let him read it are for all the right reasons. I don't mind letting him read it so that he can act on the things told in the book. I would let him read it to learn more about the past. I think it's a positive thing for kids to know about the past. So from my point of view, the censorship depends on the situation and the material. These are only my opinions on the subject, and these statements are also my opinion. So I can't really say if I'm for censorship or not.

Do I think there are any materials like books, movies, magazines, etc. that should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive ? No, I don't believe this statement for many reasons. If someone removed books from library shelves, the libraries would no longer be of use, students in school would have a harder time learning about certain subjects in the world, it would defeat the purpose to have the ability of free speech, we could easily avoid this problem if necessary. One of the reasons I think taking books off the shelves is that, if we all had the right to take books that we found offensive, there wouldn't be any more books on the shelves. This would limit the ability of students to learn about many important topics in the world. The other day I heard a lady tell her daughter that she would not allow her to go to school on the day they had " the conversation " (sex education for sixth graders), because that she thought she was too young to know more about this area of education. Yes, that @ MONTH1 is true, but it also means her daughter won't be aware of the many illnesses you can get from underage, unprotected sex. This @ MONTH1 led her daughter to have sex at a young age and get pregnant, or some kind of disease, which could have been easily avoided with a little education in the books in the library or a class in the library. 'school. Another reason I don't believe in the right to take books off the shelves is that when we take these books off the shelves, we are taking someone's really hard work and just throwing it in the trash. In my opinion, this is very disrespectful to the authors and everyone who participated in the writing of these books. Just because you don't agree with what they write doesn't mean you can just throw it away. This would defeat the objective of freedom of expression. Taking those books off the shelves is essentially telling authors that they are not out loud to write about what they want and publish it. It is also telling them that they are not allowed to express their opinion. This problem could easily be avoided if necessary. For example, these books, music, movies, magazines, etc., could be placed in a separate section of the library and only make them accessible to adults of a certain age. Have books and other writing evaluated the same way as movies. It would be a very easy and efficient way to solve this problem. As I mentioned earlier, I strongly disagree with giving citizens the right to remove certain documents, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc. from the shelves if you or someone else finds them offensive. This could affect the community in several ways, it is very rude and disrespectful to the author of this writing, and there are some simple solutions to this problem.

Yes, I think books, movies, music, and magazines should be taken off the shelves if they are offensive and inappropriate. People should have freedom of speech, but not in an offensive way. If people want to have their heirs show things like movies or hearing things like music, that should be appropriate. Just because others are doing it doesn't mean it's okay. Some people have little knowledge of not doing the things that movies or songs say to do. Most people love songs because they say to do bad things, they just want to be heard, or they want to get attention. When I listened to music or watched movies, I had the same ideas as other kids my age and under. I did stupid stuff because I thought it was right. People just want to make their voices heard and to be heard. I learned to make my voice heard, I had to do it appropriately. Some artists or actors don't want to pass this stuff on to children, but the only way to get the audience to see it is to make it offensive. I stopped reading and watching this stuff because I learned the hard way, and the only way to be heard is to say and do the right things. My way of looking at it is @ CAPS1 (@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 Do)

Censorship has been around for a while and a lot of people agree that there should be censorship on a lot of things like TV, books, magazines, almost everything. Some people go a little too far when it comes to older teens. There are no little kids and they shouldn't have censored things. Like when you go to see a movie rated @ CAPS1 and you have to be with an adult to watch that movie. For little kids, I think they should have things censored because they're young. They just don't need to hear bad language and anything. Parents should also be concerned about what the child hears or reads if he is young. Some parents don't even care what they see or hear and end up in trouble with their teachers if they say so. It seems younger kids are always learning bad language or bad habits and I think it's sad because they shouldn't be with that. They pick up a lot of stuff when they're young, so you're a role model for them. I believe older teens like @ NUM1 and @ NUM2 are more mature about this, if they're reading a book in the library that might have a bad word. I'm sure they hear it all the time on the bus or when you're in town. They're going to hear it anyway, so why try to stop it when they finally hear it. Books are meant to help you and give you the real thing. You can't just throw away books or censor them. Everyone has a different opinion and this is my opinion. When you get to a certain age you start to mature and you realize that these are the wrong things to say or do. I think high school books or magazines or whatever shouldn't be censored

Imagine, you go to your favorite library and you go get your favorite book or movie and it's not there. The librarian says the book has been pulled from all public libraries because it was found to be offensive. Wouldn't that get on your nerves? Especially if you had read the book yourself and found nothing wrong with it? Of course, there are books that children should not be allowed to view due to offensive content ; but why remove them completely? There are many alternative solutions that could appeal to everyone. Like having a section where only adults are allowed, having a separate public place for adults to get the books, movies, etc. and have signed the authorization of a parent or guardian indicating that their child can consult certain articles. The first solution is to have certain offensive material locked up from the public. If only the librarian had access to this material, a child would not be able to just come in and borrow what he sees fit. The librarian would be the only one empowered to judge whether the person, child or adult, could see this section of the library. Then there could be a totally separate building for offensive equipment. Only people over @ NUM1 would be allowed in and you would need ID and a library card to enter. This would ensure that no child could receive or take anything that would be deemed unfit. My last solution is to have a signed authorization for any minor. When the child comes to pick up a library card, the parent should be present and fill out a request indicating what the child can and cannot check. I don't believe that books, movies, music, ect; must be removed from the shelves. This goes directly against the First Amendment, freedom of speech. If a person can say what someone else can or cannot read, see or listen to, what is preventing them from taking all of the @ CAPS1 given to them ? What is stopping them from censoring everything we write and say? Would you like to live in a world like this? I definitely wouldn't! However, I also believe that certain age groups should not be allowed to have access to certain documents. I think these are good altercations to prevent this from happening if only we take the steps to accomplish them

What others find offensive may be seen by others as something they value. I believe all kinds of books, music, and magazines should stay on the library shelves. People appreciate a lot of different things, and we need to give others the opportunity to explore what else is there. Different types of books explain different types of things. Some people connect to books in ways that others @ MONTH1 don't understand. Carrying out certain types of books can endanger the feelings of others. Taking music, in my opinion, would be the worst because people get lost in certain types of music. They use music to escape their problems and removing it can leave them helpless. People love movies. It helps people understand what is going on from other people's point of view. Taking movies away could leave people without entertainment. People like different movies, and some movies can be offensive. But, it's nobody else's. Magazines help people stay on top of the news. Most news can be very offensive. It is the people around you who are the source of the offensive news. Carrying out magazines can prevent people from keeping up with the latest gossip and the latest news. Removing the things people connect with, what they escape with, their entertainment, and the news would most likely make people behave in a negative way. Everyone is different and everyone likes different things and taking away something that other people think is offensive is unfair to people who think it is not. What if someone thought what you liked was wrong? How would you feel

'The @ CAPS1 in the @ CAPS2', 'The @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4', 'The @ CAPS5 of @ PERSON2'. Do these titles sound familiar to you? They should, because these are just a tiny fraction of the @ CAPS3 literary masterpieces that people have enjoyed since their posts. These wonderful books also share another characteristic, they have all been banned from certain libraries across the country and around the world. When a child goes to school every day, his parents believe he will receive a quality education that will meet the standards of their own core values and morals. But some parents @ MOIS1 become outraged when they see the books stored on the shelves of school libraries that they consider bad, and do not want their precious children exposed to such immoral concepts that go against the grain. their idea of what is right. In all reality though, how does that help someone? By removing a student from a book or topic, the censor is limiting what that student can learn. By censoring things, people are not only kept away from ideas that might shock them, but also ideas that might make them think. If a person cannot think for himself, he cannot draw his own conclusions about things. When one cannot think for oneself or make decisions for oneself, how can that person be considered a free individual. Infamous dictators, such as @ PERSON1, have burned books to prevent its citizens from thinking what they don't want them to think. By banning a book from a school library, a parent is also preventing their child from thinking what they don't want them to think. And when you want to take a book out of a school library, not only are you preventing your child from reading that book, but not everyone who goes to school is reading it. How is that fair? So instead of wanting certain books to be taken off the shelves at your child's school, I say this. Teach your children to be careful what they read. If you don't want them to read “ The @ CAPS1 in the @ CAPS2, ” tell them not to read this book. Tell your kids to follow any moral guidelines you want them to follow, and if some books prevent them from having their own thoughts instead of yours, just tell them not to watch and disturb everyone. on this subject.

Some books should be removed from the library because of the materials and objects they show to young children. One of the reasons they should trust these books is that some of them are racist against certain cultures. Another reason is that some books or movies, etc., would contain things that young children should not watch or read. A final reason is that some books just shouldn't be in libraries. The first reason was that the books had to be taken out of the library because they were racist. They should take them off because they can teach young children bad things. They can also teach children how to treat people differently because they are reading these books from the library. They would also have misconceptions about people and different cultures. The second reason they should get rid of these bad things in libraries is because they have things in them that young children shouldn't look at or read. Like if they shouldn't have movies about murder and drug dealing or alcohol or whatever a kid shouldn't watch. It gives kids a bad idea and they'll think it's good because they've seen it in the movies or read it in a book. The last reason is that they shouldn't have these things in a library at all or they should just have a place where young children can't use them. Or they would need a parent or eighteen year old so they couldn't just get those bad books or movies. In conclusion, libraries should not contain books, music, magazines or movies at all. They give kids the wrong ideas and make them think it's cool or the right thing to do because they saw it in a movie or read it in a book. That doesn't make it the right thing to do, which is why they should get rid of this stuff.

Keep it on the shelves. The purpose of libraries is that people can read whatever they want to read. If I had a bookcase I would have everything on the shelves because there are a lot of people and not everyone likes the same thing. Honestly, I don't care because it's not just a handful of people, but everyone's feelings. If people started removing certain things from bookstore libraries, eventually it would get out of hand. The reason it would get out of hand is that a certain topic like slavery if anyone wanted to know more or liked to read topics like this it wouldn't be fair because @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 people could find offensive to put things out there for the public like that. Everyone has their own opinion, but why express your own opinion if the topic you want to express it on is not harming anyone physically or emotionally. If everyone's opinions were heard and taken into consideration in the world as we know it, it would be boring and outrageous. People love action and adventure, others love the laid back stuff. Why take things from people that they have had for a very long time if it will just spark conflict and change the way people live everyday life. Maybe it could turn out the right way, but what really are the odds of this @ NUM1 billion to a thousand. Things that are offensive to some people are very interesting to others, so keep everything on the shelves. If only some people are going to complain about it, that's okay too. Maybe one day when everyone agrees on @ NUM2 reasoning, we can change it, but I really don't see that happening anytime soon. The main reason is that there will always be a conflict between @ NUM3 or more groups of people. Not everyone can be happy at the same time i say who cares whether something offends someone or not is their opinion and until many more people see it and can stay on the shelf for people who actually enjoy that stuff.

Books? Movies? Music? Magazines? We all love to read them, watch them and listen to them. @ CAPS2 is hard to stop all of this. In addition, @ CAPS2 is unstoppable. Everywhere you go you can find these items. Like the movie theater, mall, gas station, garage sale, and even your public library. People of all ages can go anywhere and buy a book, movie, @ CAPS1 or magazine and @ CAPS2 is perfectly fine. But there is a problem. Censorship. Yes that's what I said, 'censorship.' @ CAPS2 means a lot to some parents when @ CAPS2 speaks to their children. Especially when @ CAPS2 comes to the public library where they live. If a parent want to take their kids to the library and buy books or movies or ect. That's okay, but if a parent has to worry about a movie or magazine that has “ bad stuff ” in @ CAPS2 that kids shouldn't see, that's a problem. They want to be able to enjoy the movie or @ CAPS1 or the magazine with their kids, but bad things like nudity, violence, racial images or profanity can be really offensive to parents AND single people, but not parents. . Many of these examples can be offensive to anyone, and censorship is a great idea. There is no way if I was a parent that I would want my kids to watch or watch or read "bad stuff" because we all know that is wrong. Children are young and don't need to learn this stuff at a young age. I think censorship is a really good idea and I think libraries and other places that have books, movies, music, magazines, etc. should censor things there. But if they don't censor anything, they should at least put them into categories like " adults " or " young adults " or " children ." If they categorize the grades, you and the parents know where to look and don't have to worry about censorship. Censorship should be practiced everywhere.

Corrupted censorship @ CAPS1 @ MONTH1 occurs when the censor decides to remove or block ; showing certain media or readable content is up to the creator. In some cases, the distributor and less the author, director or publisher, have no opinion on whether to display the product they have made, but their own habit of doing what 'they like ; it is the will of the store, the person or etc. to display these materials. Libraries have an exponential option to put publicly on their shelves or stock, but restricting overly graphic material depends on the pedagogical rules with which the library is equipped. Any kind of content is art, art that should never even be considered changed or improved because it belongs to an artist. You can never remake, rewrite or recreate this visual material provided by the creator. And you are not out loud, unless the creator gives you permission to do so. Censorship or deletion, on the other hand, is permitted at the distributor. Their choice to publicly demonstrate something someone has done is their choice. Libraries, for example, show that any media or readable content is displayed publicly for everyone to see, as long as the audience matches their rules or criteria. In some cases, part of the audience will pass through unexpected media and have the inexceptional persuasion to accept what is being shown. While it is not the creators' fault to ensure where their content is displayed, but the public's fault whether or not to see that material. It's the choice to read or see what you want, you don't have to follow what the distributor - let alone the creator - offers. Appreciating the subject or material is optional. When you have options in front of you, given topics or topics to read or follow, it is your will to choose to read or see them. Profiting is even more difficult, but when a library's limit is basically the sky, you shouldn't force it to throw the book away just because the censorship isn't up to your level. It is not the library to blame, but yours. Everyone has different views on certain content and you don't have to see them. When you remove @ CAPS2 material intended for those who have chosen to see and enjoy, you are destroying not the @ CAPS2 art that a creator has created, but the joy that has filled the taste of viewers. Libraries should not adapt to the expectations of some people, because not everyone finds a solution to censorship. Katherine Paterson once said, “ We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you also have the exact same right and so on and so forth. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us.

Nowadays, people can take offense at anything. In today's tough times, readers, listeners, and even writers are trying to get what they want, not what the consumer wants. Even if some stories, books, or articles are completely wrong, it shouldn't matter. Don't let other people's opinions spoil it for everyone. Many people take offense these days for absolutely nothing; and they feel the need to do something about it. which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is not a good thing either. It's freedom of speech, or that's what the constitution says, which means people have the right to read, write, or say whatever they want. False and false writings are a small problem for readers and writers. People read articles, deliver and believe every moment of what they read or write or even hear on the radio lately. It's hard to believe anything these days because you never really know the facts unless you experience them for yourself. Opinions are the most important thing that people need to pay attention to, but it always comes down to freedom of speech. Reading and writing is a wonderful thing to do and has been around longer than any human being will ever know. Don't let the opinions of other readers get in the way of a good thing

Controversy and @ CAPS1 'We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you have the exact same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. (Katherine Paterson, author.) Paterson makes a very valid point here. Right off the bat I can think of many offensive or inappropriate books, movies, songs, and magazines. There are equal amounts of good and bad posts, and the decision of what is good or bad is very controversial. The creator of each song, movie, song, magazine, or other publication created their product for a specific customer. Playboy magazine wasn't made for five-year-olds, but for desperate, sex-crazed men, and @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 weren't made for adults, but for young children. Usually, the destination of the product is not meant to be negative. It breaks my heart to hear about the growing number of people of different ages who are engaging in pornography. I think the whole idea is wrong, degrading and utterly disgusting, but others strongly disagree. Some religions think the @ CAPS4 series is blasphemous, while others strongly disagree. Controversy fills everything in our culture. We all have our opinions and our choices. Should I be allowed to take books away from my child? My mom wouldn't let me read @ ORGANIZATION1's books when I was younger. She felt it was from the devil and pure evil. It makes me want to read it even more than before. When I entered college, I still read the books: I had the ability to make my own choices. I haven't seen the devil in the books. In fact, I had the opposite feelings towards the book. The books reflected good versus evil, which I saw as @ CAPS5 versus Satan. My opinions and views were very different from my mother's. If I had read the books when I was younger, I might have thought differently. I think my mom protected me from what could have been wrong. I think it's perfectly okay to protect your children by setting rules and limits. Parents just need to be aware that once the kids get older, they'll be making the choices for themselves. Overall, some books will be in the kids section for one reason, and some will be in the adult section for other reasons. We need to exercise judgment and trust our children to make the right choices about what they let into their brains and consume their thoughts.

No, @ CAPS1 doesn't think there should be censorship in libraries. We have free speech for a reason. Of course, some things may not be appropriate for certain people or age groups, but eventually everyone will be here, seeing, or being involved in something that they are not meant to like, appreciate, or with which. He does not agree.

Do people take the offending books seriously? There are a lot of things in the book that the folks at @ MONTH1 find offensive. Other people @ MONTH1 think differently. I'm pretty sure libraries have censored shelves, but if not, people shouldn't be so worried and here are ways. I have the impression that some of the material that young people see in books, music and films are in the library. They see things around them. they also see what their mentor and parents are doing / watching too. The author of the quote (Katherine Paterson) cannot just blame the library. In the paragraph I wrote before that, I said the kids see things parents and parents do there. Today in the @ NUM1 century, parents aren't really watching things and what they are leaving out for what their child can get. Children like to play with the things they see first. If parents don't want their child to see offensive material and other things on the shelves of a library, then they should watch what children are doing more carefully and watch their backs. I really don't care if library shelves are offensive. Anyway, I don't pay attention to it. We live in a better world than years ago. If people still get mad about trivial things like this, then why are they still here. As young children get older, they will eventually see things that they couldn't see and that will always be on the shelves of a library. We shouldn't offend the books. After all, these are just words on a piece of paper. I believe offensive materials and the like should stay on the library shelves. In addition, sometimes some people need to know the truth in order to understand things better.

I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be taken off the shelves. If a book, magazine, movie, etc. is deemed offensive, you should just walk away and ignore it. Don't go back and keep looking at it because something that you find offensive might appeal to someone else. The world is not going to change around you, so you should do the smart thing and ignore it. If something is deemed offensive by censorship in libraries, it might not be a good idea for you to be where you are in that library. And if something offends you, you should always act in the right way and handle the situation in the right way. When I was younger I would see books with a cover titled @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2, @ CAPS3, @ CAPS4, etc., and thought it was funny, but adults didn't think so. The books are there for people to read, not just to look at them. Books, music, movies, magazines are not there to offend you in any way. If you find anything offensive, you should just walk away from that area, so that you don't worry about being offended. Different people like different things, so they will have many different varieties to choose from in a library. They can have things that really offend you or they can have things that you really like. You need to make a wise choice and know that if something is going to offend you, avoid it. Censorship in libraries has the right to display any piece of book, music, film, magazine, etc., because it is in their phacility. They shouldn't have to worry that people are offended by anything they post. They shouldn't have to worry about people being offended because @ PERCENT1 of the time the things they post aren't bad at all, "that @ MONTH1 is even useful", but for one person, @ MONTH1 is harmful or offense. In @ CAPS5, library censorship should be able to publish or store whatever it wants. If you are offended / not offended, they have every right to put anything aside. because in the real world you don't always get what you want, and you won't always like what you see

A library is a haven of peace. A place where people can go to escape the world and put their heads in a book. It is a place full of knowledge and information. You can find information about anything in a library, from any point of view. Information in libraries should not be censored, even if the information is considered offensive. A library should not be biased. Removing certain information from a library would be biased for any group that believes in that knowledge. Whether or not something is offensive, the information should be available so that we can read it if we want to. Having information in a library that @ MONTH1 is offensive does not mean that a person is obligated to read it. Katherine Paterson brings up a good point when she says, "If I have the right to take this book off the shelf ... and you have the exact same right too, and everyone else too." And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us ”. If everyone could remove a book that offends them, there would be no more books. There are many different views on many different topics and everyone should have the opportunity to be informed about the views of others. For example, there are many different religions in the world. Many religions have very conflicting views and some of their views @ MONS1 are mutually offensive. This does not mean that we should not provide information about the different religions of the world just because someone of another religion @ MONTH1 is offended. Anyone who visits a library should have the right to learn about the religions of others. If we censored all the books that offended people, we would be living in a very uneducated world. A library is a place of education and learning. It is a place where one can go and learn about any subject he chooses. If libraries censored information, it would no longer be an impartial place. It would have a hold over a certain group of people and, therefore, would no longer be a safe haven for all to escape the world. You couldn't go to a library and have different points of view on every subject. Censorship of books and other materials in libraries would be a very negative thing.

Hi, my name is @ CAPS1 and I'm writing this article today to talk about things that shouldn't be in the library. There are many, many things that should not be exposed to children, such as sexcism, racism, @ CAPS3 report, pornography. So I'm here today to talk to you about these things. First of all, books with racist comments should not be exposed to our young children. Why ? Because it sets them a bad example, so they might think they can say and do the things the book does. Another thing is sex in the books. I know you've read stories about sex and how to do it and all kinds of things. So, to sum up, they should not be allowed in public libraries. The second thing that shouldn't be allowed in public libraries is @ CAPS2- @ CAPS3 movies. Things like horror movies, porn, and many more. So young children should not be exposed to these things as it damages their minds at a young age. It teaches them things they shouldn't know until they're a little older. The last reason I think a lot of things shouldn't be in libraries is for @ CAPS4 magazines. These magazines just show everything they have, all types of nude photos in them. These really don't need to be exposed to our young children because. Our little girls will think that they can take nude photos of themselves and publish them in books and on the Internet. So all in all, all of these things should be taken out of libraries for a lot of different reasons. So the @ LOCATION1 should think about what I'm saying. Just think if your kids were exposed to inappropriate things

As a child, I remember my mother reading me stories to fall asleep. There has always been one book that I remember most named, "A Light in the @ CAPS1" by @ PERSON1. As I walked into my public library the other day, I looked at the books that had been censored because it encouraged the following; mistreating parents, offensive language, bad habits and other things. I was furious that this book was, for the most part, deleted from all children's literature just because a few people @ CAPS2 gave it the wrong message. Think about it though, when you're a kid reading a book to yourself or reading one yourself, do you honestly pay attention to those little details ? I don't think books and music shouldn't be censored because society does a good job of thinking and figuring out what's okay and what's not. I understand the idea of warning labels, but I think the censorship is too far. In the example I used in the paragraph above, this actually happened to me. So, I don't think things should be censored just because a small group of people think it's inappropriate. Even when I read this book today, I don't see any of the reasons listed in the book. So believe that it has been unfairly censored, which means that a great book will never reach the eyes and ears of a child who deserves to hear and read it. Over the years a lot has been censored, some had a real reason, others may have been reviewed and censored because someone didn't like the way they read the book. the point is, people should have a choice of what they can get from their public or school library. Maybe they should just give an idea by saying that there is potentially inappropriate material in this certain book that it should not be read by or by a certain age group. When you think back to your childhood and think of all the books that have been read to you and enjoyed, how many of those books have been deleted for reasons that make no sense ? This is the main reason why I think there shouldn't be any censorship

Almost every town in @ LOCATION1 has a public library. A place where citizens can consult books, music, movies, magazines and more. Inside a bookcase there are different sections. There are sections for children, adults, fiction and many more. Like any regular store, there are items in a library that are not intended for children. A common question that comes up in everyday life : " Should we remove these offensive items from our shelves ?" " Libraries have existed for years and so have uncensored things that are presented to children. As a child, you want to explore and learn everything. Bad things will always be put in front of you as an obstacle to making the right choice. Much like those degrading objects that you find in everyday stores, libraries, or in general wherever you go. A library, however, is not just for adults, teens, or young children. A library is made for everyone to access and not everyone is the same. So there is a lot of variety in these libraries. It should never be the fault of libraries for containing things that are not suitable for children in my opinion. Almost all libraries are very organized into categories. If kids are separate and exclusive to adult material, I see no problem having these items on the shelves. When I visit a library, these items are very out of the reach of children. Society knows what should and should not be brought to a child, so they know it should not be put within the reach of children. "We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves." said author, Katherine Paterson. Katherine makes a very valid statement. If I have a child someday I could think of a lot of documents that I hope my child never meets. However, as a parent, it is their job to protect their children from these things. Coming from a teenage perspective, at a young age I was very ignorant of all the terrible things around me. A majority of children couldn't get their hands on such uncensored objects, and they wouldn't understand them if they did. There are things in this world that are much worse for children to see as they take a quick glance at something that is not for their age in a library. Rather, concerned parents should pay more attention to what their children come into contact with in stores, who surrounds them or what they listen / watch. The internet is probably the least censored place a child can come across. Speaking to libraries to find out what they're putting on their shelves should be their least concern about what's really going on in life. I believe that no child should be surrendered or subjected to uncensored adult conduct because it is one hundred percent unacceptable. If these items were placed in places where only adults can get hold of, then I see no problem with the situation. Children of our generation and generations to come will always encounter something that they should not be placed against. However, this is life and there will always be something in your life that you shouldn't witness or be separated from. If libraries continue to keep these items out of the reach of children, then there should be no censorship in libraries.

Censorship, @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2? I can understand why libraries decide to remove certain books from their shelves. Libraries are a place of learning and work. If you were sitting near someone in a public library reading coal, you might feel uncomfortable. While some @ MONTH1 people find certain things harmless, others @ MONTH1 disagree. Imagine that you are a mother with a young child who has decided to browse the library. Your child finds a magazine. It is '@ CAPS3'. Not something that you are going to want to explain to your child. If the library hadn't kept the magazine, it never would have happened. Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously. If people really want to find something inappropriate, they can find it elsewhere. Today's modern world allows people to find just about anything without much hassle. Therefore, it should be acceptable to keep certain materials out of our libraries. How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with foul language and outrageous themes. If you are trying to do work or learn and there are some distracting items on the shelves, then @ MONTH1 makes it harder. Libraries are serious places and should be treated as such.

There should be a certain age shelf that only certain old people can look at aloud. It's like the adult section in the library. There is no reason to take them off the shelves. I would understand if little kids could come and see the books and movies and be offended or scared by them, but that's why you would create a certain section just for the older and more mature people. It would just depend on what offends people and what offends them. There are some things that could or would be bad for small children to see, but just make sure that they could not be within the reach of young children or immature people. The only way I would say delete them if it was really offensive like racism and stuff like that. Censorship in libraries is in my opinion a good thing. Simply because some people might not like the things that would be in a library or the things they have in the library. So I should say yes to library censorship.

There are many books, movies, and magazines on the shelves that can offend people in a number of ways. It can be about war, slavery, and even religion books that could infuriate people and make them feel the need to remove these books from libraries without hesitation. There are indeed many books that might offend people and could be discriminatory, but should these books really be taken down? I believe the books were made for a purpose. Every book and even magazine contains information about what is going on in the world or what could happen. Even for books that aren't realistic, they're also made for a reason and should have a place in the library. The library offers more than thousands of books and films. If there was even a book that someone found discriminating or offensive, they could always read it and choose one that matched what they wanted. I think it's the person's choice of what they want to read or watch not the fault of books or movies. Books and Movies are also divided into genres that each movie and book belongs to. So if you don't specifically want to see something, you can just ignore the section that has the movies or books that you find discriminating and go to the ones that you feel good with. There are also a lot of books and movies out there that may seem discriminating, but they could actually tell you about life, what could happen, and how to fix these issues. For example, when I was a kid I would read that this girl had a car accident and lost everything just because she was drunk while driving. My mom didn't want me to read the book, but it actually helped me a lot because it taught me the invaluable lesson never to drive drunk, reading this book at such a young age. and putting the story into my head, I know I'll never do what this girl did in my life. It shows that even though a book may seem discriminating and wrong, it can still teach people life lessons and dangers that they probably wouldn't know unless they read that book or watch that movie. I think even if we removed offensive magazines, books, and movies that have no potential, people would still find a way to get what they were looking for, even if it came from the library or not. There are a lot of people wrong in this world and banning certain books from the library probably wouldn't stop them from doing what they want to do. Music is another thing that shouldn't be so confused. Some people listen to certain types of music to calm themselves down. An example is rapper @ CAPS1 @ ORGANIZATION1. His songs consist of great sadness and frequent swearing, but in his songs there are messages that can relate to other people and listening to this song could prevent them from doing illegal things or even committing suicide. . Songs can symbolize their life and let them know that they are not the only ones living this way and that they are not always alone in what they are doing. I think every book, movie, and magazine has at least one thing that a person may find offensive. If we start removing each and every one that someone finds offensive, there will likely not be a single book left on the library shelves. The books we read, the magazines we watch, and the movies we watch will probably have something offensive about it, but I don't think they should be censored or deleted as there is always a chance that those books, movies or magazines help you later in life

Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are privileges that we @ CAPS1 are fortunate to have. I don't believe in censorship in libraries. Authors, editors, editors and directors all have the right to express their views on their work. If they wish to express mature subjects in their work, that is their choice. As people, they have the right to distribute their books, magazines and films as they wish. We all have a choice of what books and movies we want to view in libraries. Movies should have ratings so that audiences know the extent of maturity you need to have to watch the movie. For example, if you are a @ NUM1 year old who wants to buy a movie but is rated @ CAPS2 that is not the best movie choice. This is not @ MONTH1 the best choice because movies rated @ CAPS2 let the audience know that it is an adult audience over @ NUM2. When it comes to books, I often use a book review website that allows me to view the contents of the book. If I see that the book has material that I don't want to read or think the material is too mature, I don't read it. I have the power to choose the books I read and the responsibility to choose the books that are best suited to my age and level of maturity. There are a lot of ways to track the content of the things we can extract. Just because a movie or a book comes out doesn't mean we have to watch or read it. We all make choices in our everyday lives. Some are tall and some are small. Choosing a book or movie to buy from a library is a small choice, but it's our choice to choose what we can handle. Authors, directors and editors should not have their work punished if certain people disagree with the content they put in their material. Everyone's opinion varies on what is right and wrong. Therefore, if you think something is inappropriate, you have a choice not to read or watch it. I think we are lucky to have this freedom of opinion and speech. While we shouldn't abuse it, we must remember that we don't have the right to tell others how to use this freedom. Because we have the choice to read what we want, authors have the choice of what they want to write about. Libraries should not deprive us of this freedom that allows us to make our own decisions about what to watch or read

Do you ever feel that books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are sometimes offensive ? For my experience of listening to music and watching movies, it can sometimes be offensive without even knowing it. I've listened to rap and all the bad words they use before, and I watch movies that are only white or black. So I think some music, movies, etc. could take off. If I think something is offensive, I pretty much blow it off like it's nothing. I'm doing this because I watched @ CAPS1 The @ CAPS2 the whites and blacks didn't have much time, and they had to play soccer to come together. Then they finally hit it off and won the Champions Match. For me I think it's great because people were offending, and got over it and now there are friends. So don't take @ CAPS3 offensive. I say this because how do you know the actor or writer was or is talking about you. I look at it like it's a small matter. I like @ CAPS3 like that, I find it funny. It can also help you learn what's going on in our world and what we've accomplished. So I really don't take this @ CAPS3 as an offense. But, other people may take it offensive and that is a problem. There is nothing we can do about it. If something is offensive, don't listen to it, watch it or read it. So don't think he has the right to take it off the shelf and hate it. They can have a very good meaning behind it. There are many good movies, songs, and books around the world. So don't abominate it and move on with life, don't let @ CAPS3 get to you. That's why I don't think he has the right to take it off the shelf and take it offensive. That's why I think it's okay to take @ CAPS3 offensive.

Dear Diary, I would like to start by saying that yes, books, magazines, music, movies, etc. are great for children in the library. I think it's the best thing for them to do when they have nothing to do, go to the library and read or work on stuff in the library and I think some things should be in the library because we are in high school and we need to learn some things here, but some of the things we are learning are not very appropriate. In high school, you just have to walk down the hall to learn a lot of things that you probably don't need to know yet, but when you walk into a library, they don't need to encourage it by putting books on it. drugs, alcohol and sex on the shelves. The books on drugs are good to some extent. If your reading about meds you can take and be in the doctor's office and get cleared up, that's fine, but when you've got books on pot, weed, crank, or methamphetamine, that's fine. a bit too much. We need to learn more about these drugs and what they might do to us if we use or abuse them, but we don't need to know how to blunt or make meth. The books on alcohol are the same way. We need to know the dangers of alcohol, but we don't need to know about teen parties and what to do when you're drunk. Ads, magazines etc are the worst things for us kids because each of them has something to do with drugs, alcohol or sex and try to get us to do these things in high school . Magizines cover always has people who have been taken with drugs going out or sleeping with who and ik that we go and need to know these things but I don't think we need to read them in books because so we read them and see how others have done it and we feel the urge to do it or try it. I believe that those books that cross the line on alcohol, drugs and sex need to be taken out of libraries so that children have something to learn and to question their parents. I have been to libraries and I know for a fact that the first books I consult have one of these three books because these are interesting and we love to read stories at parties or about someone getting pregnant. or a @ ORGANIZATION1 but also when I read I think about it and think I want to go to a party where they look like fun. This is what I think about some of these books on their own and what I think should happen. Sincerely, @ LOCATION1

Libraries Do you go to libraries? A lot of people go to libraries for many different reasons. Sometimes when you go there you have to have a reason to be there. You also have to be very calm. Libraries are very interesting in many ways. Some @ MONTH1 ask what a library is, well these are great places to go. People can go there for a lot of different things. Most of the time when people go to a library, they go looking for books. Not only can you get books from there, but also go there for private lessons, for a place to read and just to go somewhere quiet. See libraries have a lot to do. Why do people go to libraries? Well, personally I don't go to a library but a lot of others do. People who love to read go there to find the kind of book they want. I would go there to do school tours, I really need it. It helps you a lot and allows you to do your homework. My mother goes there on certain occasions, for example to get information from a book or from a computer. They have a lot of information that they can look up. Then there are the online geeks, who love to hook up with video games. I go on the internet but not for video games. There is another reason people go to the library. My little sister loves going to the library. She is only eight years old. Why am I telling you this? Now, when you walk into a library, you can't get a book if you're a minor. In this case, you need to have parental permission to be able to get one, but not only that, you need to have library card to get a book. I no, stupid rules right? THEN, again, you must have parental permission for this ! Well, after the permission is over, when you go to get a book, you have to make sure it's your own grade level. I have to watch this with my sister all the time because otherwise they will yell at you. Personally, I think it's good for most kids. So now you know the libraries are very strict. Now that I've told you all about libraries, I hope you've learned something from it. Remember, these are great places to go for information, to get books, or to just go somewhere quiet. You can always find a library around, there is NO @ CAPS1 ! Well if you don't like reading or being calm you shouldn't go. I'll leave this for you.

In @ LOCATION1, people like to do a lot of different things for fun. Some like to go to the movies. Others prefer a nice walk through the park. These days everyone is stuck and thinks that we shouldn't see and / or read bad, nasty and offensive things. I believe we should be able to see what we want. The number one reason we should be able to read whatever we want is because we are allowed to. There are a lot of things we can't do, but reading shouldn't be one of them. We shouldn't have to ask someone if a book can be read or not. It's not fair to those who want to read it. I find that very silly. The second reason why we should be able to read whatever we want is because if you don't like it, don't read it. It's a very simple and straightforward concept. Everyone today worries about what other people are doing. If you don't like something, don't take it and read it. If I knew there was a book that I didn't like because it offended me, I wouldn't read it. It's that simple. The third and final reason why we should be able to read what we want is because it is not what others do or read. Everyone today is so worried about the next guy it's not even funny. If we all worried about ourselves, then we would be better off. If I read a book that I find offensive or bad, I wouldn't tell others it's a bad book and should be taken off the shelves. It is not fair and it is not fair. We should be able to read whatever we want. It is our right to read it. Also if you don't like it then don't read it. People today are too worried about other people. If other people want to read a book that you find offensive or bad, there is nothing you can do about it. This is how life works.

If there are things you take offense to, you shouldn't read the pieces of literature that make you feel like that. Ask some of your friends or research the book / magazine before reading it. Sometimes the front can be misleading, so be sure to read the description first. A lot of people who read certain things @ MOIS1 take them the wrong way and think they're saying something they don't really mean. That's why they take offense, but the more you understand a piece of literature, the less offended you are. You should try to accept at least part of what the book / magazine says in case you need it in the future. You @ MONTH1 get upset when you first read something, and @ MONTH1 doesn't notice that it might help you when you think about it. Thinking about things is a great way to learn how to deal with being offended, you just need to look at it from both points of view. They both might have great ideas and great functions for them. Try to avoid them if you are still offended by them, don't read a lot of books / magazines that contain offensive stuff. Ignore commercials on TV or computers that contain more than what you need to know or if they make you uncomfortable watching them. If you read them, you might feel worse or get angry. Sometimes they can even make you stress a bit. If you are truly offended by something, the best thing you can do is to avoid it. Avoiding something helps you not to read or think about them. It works for a lot of situations, not just this one, so if you need to get away from stress, just ignore them.

Books can always be amazing things in the way they take us to whole new worlds and enlighten us on new ideas that @ MONTH1 have never thought of before. However, are some books too hard to handle and shouldn't they be read? Well, think about what you @ MONTH1, but I think all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what's going on in the real world, even some of the bad parts. Different assortments of media should definitely not leave or be banned from libraries because people need to be educated in everything out there, they need to know even the bad things in this world so that they can hopefully -le, be sufficiently educated on this subject to be able to move away from it. evil acts and help to fight against them, and above all it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the possibility of being who he wants to be. Although we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can stand up and do what is right. Even @ DATE1 education is influenced by people saying that students cannot learn certain areas of knowledge, but in the long run does it really help people ? If people were educated enough to know everything we know and what they themselves choose to learn as an individual, wouldn't that help them become curious and learn lies from? an invalid source, instead of the range of resources to which they would have access? them in a library? Every individual should have the right to learn what he wants to learn and should not be cut off from any resources, otherwise he @ MONTH1 will never learn the real truth behind a subject, which would defeat the purpose of learning. These knowledge seekers should always be able to search as they please, so that they @ MOIS1 will learn and hopefully make new breakthroughs for the benefit of all, but they can only hope for this with proper education. Another point to consider is that people need this variety of education, so that they can work for causes that are close to their hearts. With knowledge, people can make new innovations and create and disseminate new ideas to help make the world a better place. Although this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they are against something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and for what cause they are against something. grow. The only way people can really get their ideas heard is when they can understand everything about their topics. Without certain points of information that could be removed, the people @ MONTH1 have no basis for what they are saying and they would even hinder the learning processes of others. Another reason for not having censorship is that we all have the right in @ LOCATION1, and hopefully in the world someday, to be who we want to be in search of happiness as long as we don't get in the way. not someone else's dreams in our own pursuit. People just need to be who they really are to help the world and make a difference, because if we weren't allowed to be our own individuals, people would never move forward. Without this advancement, people would have remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people have chosen to seek knowledge and in doing so have given us the technology that people have @ DATE1. Harry @ CAPS1 even argues in his popular book series that we must know the enemy in order to fight him. Would it have become such a success if others did not believe in it too? Changing that would go against the rights that people found for themselves, which means if we gave up those rights people would have regressed. People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in libraries. These types of media help shape who each individual is and help them contribute to the world in their life. While there will always be bad media, we need to understand even the bad ones in this world, so that hopefully people will make a choice to fight them. We certainly wouldn't be all the people we are @ DATE1 without all of the influences on us and even removing some of our knowledge we would end up disqualifying ourselves. These choices help us all, hopefully, to move forward and continue to move forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge continues forever.

I think if some people don't like a certain book or movie, they should be able to tell the library about it and it should be removed from the library. The library should allow people who use the library to take away things that are offensive to its customers. Some parents who walk into a library with their kids let their kids go look at books on their own, which my @ CAPS1 let me do when I was a kid. If the kids are alone without adult supervision and walk around an adult reading section, they might see something bad. They could also buy a magazine that looks perfectly good on the outside but has offensive images on the inside. When I was ten my family and I went on vacation to @ LOCATION1. One night we were watching a baseball game on commercial break. We were browsing the channels while waiting for the game to start. We were all watching TV when an offensive picture appeared on TV that children's eyes shouldn't see. This occurrence happened when neither my parents nor I wanted me to see it. This image was an adult image and was intended for adults only, but children's eyes can see it as well. Libraries should think about this when putting books and magazines on their shelves. They may earn a little money, but they negatively affect the life of a child. Things like this could happen in a library too because children who are young will not always know what a children's book is and what an adult magazine is. Children can also ask their parents for music so that the music box may sound good on the outside, but there are curses and bad things inside. This is the reason why all items in a library that are offensive to people should be removed from libraries. If people who go to the library don't like something on the shelves, they should be able to ask the library to remove the item from the shelves. The library might not do this every time, but removing items from the shelves would make libraries more enjoyable and safer for children. If the library does not remove the items from the shelves, it could be detrimental to its business. The library should only collect items that regular visitors to the library request. The library should not listen to someone who has only visited the library a few times. The library must listen to its customers who visit it often. I think all images offensive to people visiting the library should be removed from the shelves and removed from the library. The library should listen to its customers not only because it could affect their business, but also because it could affect the lives of children in a positive or negative way.

Offensive things found in a library. Nowadays in many libraries there are all kinds of vile and evil books that talk about vilenst. If libraries are removing those books, movies, or music from the shelves, find out. The library should not have to remove this information from the library. If they have bad related books, they should just create a different section in the library for them. For movies rated @ CAPS1, they may have them in the library. You must be over @ NUM1 years old. For music, if it has an @ CAPS2 sticker, you must have more than @ NUM2 to rent it. If the parents don't like it, don't get it. They should create different sections in the library for the offensive books they have. Children under the age of majority should not be allowed to read books. If they still want the book, they have to get parental permission to rent it. Movies rated @ CAPS1 should be allowed in the library. It is enough to have more than @ NUM1 to go in this zone and with an adult. If you want to rent a movie, you must have parental permission. You also have to watch this movie with an adult. Music if it has an @ CAPS2 sticker, you must have more than @ NUM2 to rent it. You can still rent it if your parents say it's ok. They should do the @ CAPS5 behind the counter. So that small children cannot see the front of the cases. If parents don't like library rules, don't rent anything from the library. So don't take off any offensive books, movies, or @ CAPS5. If you were the head of the library, what would you do. Remove the offending things or just put them in different sections

Reading is very popular. It is something to do when you are sitting at home and also when you are in class. School libraries are filled with different varieties of books and magazines and the like. Some of these books might be offensive to some people. These books should not be removed from the library shelves. There are books that some people find so shocking that they can't even keep reading the rest of the book. Whether it's sexual or even political, if the reader finds it offensive, they won't read the rest of the book. There are books that describe sex scenes in detail, and many parents don't want their children to read these kinds of books. This is no reason to remove books from the library shelves. It @ MONTH1 would be offensive to some people, but if you took it off the shelves, it wouldn't be available to others who can handle this kind of story. Parents' children just shouldn't read these books. Libraries cannot take all books away from readers who like these kinds of books. There are also books on politics. The majority of people stay firm with politics and do not budge when it comes to discussing what they believe to be right or true. When a reader comes across a book that goes against their view of politics, there can be a real problem. Politics being serious business, many people can overreact when someone tells them that what they believe and thinks to be true is really not. The politicians themselves especially. However, many authors write on political topics, and some books may educate the reader on points he has not seen before. If a reader disagrees with what the author writes or finds it offensive, they should not read the book. There are many other readers who would love to read this book and learn more about politics. If a reader knows that this kind of reading offends him, then he should know not to take the book in the first place. Many libraries offer music, movies and magazines to discover and take home. It is true that many of these movies or song lyrics can sound offensive. For this reason, they shouldn't be checking them. Lots of people like music or movies that have offensive language. It's something that adds to the song or the movie. People know their limits and if they know the content, they should stay away. As long as there are other readers and people who enjoy these kinds of books and music, they should keep them on the shelves. Removing them would only decrease the number of people who visit the library. You can go to your local library and find people looking at the music section, and the music section is the only reason they come to the library in the first place. The music and film section must remain in the libraries. People viewing them should be mature and responsible enough to know if they find the content offensive. Libraries should not take certain books, films, and magazines that some people find offensive. Some books and music have content that is offensive to some readers and viewers. However, if it is offensive to the first person, it doesn't mean that it will be offensive to the next. Libraries should keep these sections in their libraries for all types of readers. Reading is an extremely popular activity. Readers want a variety of books, music, and movies to choose from.

In every school or library, many people see books that are inappropriate for their liking. Everyone has their own opinion, and what may seem offensive to you, @ MONTH1 is something someone might want to know. So, should we remove the books that only the majority of people find offensive, or should we keep them anyway? Here is what I believe we should be doing. Books are meant for learning and for the sake of not trying to offend anyone. They each have their own purpose and there was a reason they were written. There are tons of books that a lot of people don't like, but that doesn't mean someone else doesn't. We should keep the books in schools and libraries because @ MONTH1 be they might help someone in some way and if they weren't there how could that person get help if nothing else was available ? One thing we can do is categorize books by genre, so people know what they're looking for. Many people find these books "offensive" because they come across them at random. If every book was put into a certain category, this incident would not happen. It also helps keep everything organized that way. So when you walk into the library you know what you are looking for, you can just jump right into that section and not looking at anything other than @ MONTH1 offends you. Keeping books on the shelves is what all libraries and schools intend to do. This is the main reason for libraries. They help you learn and get information about things that you might not be able to get elsewhere. If each library removed the books, each person complained about the usefulness of having the library? There would be nothing left. In short, everyone has a right to their opinion and has the right to think that a book is offensive, but the reality is that it was written for a reason. If the library or whoever published it thought it was going to be a big deal, they probably wouldn't have put it out there for the world to see. So keep the books on the shelves

Going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different kinds of books. It's not the only choice they face, either. There is also music and magazines. Just in books, there are so many different topics and categories between children's books, biographies, autobiographies, etc. In addition to that , there are many different types of music to suit different styles of everyone. Some people might say that some of the books and / or music might be deemed offensive or inappropriate. But among all the items in the library, I don't think there should be a problem staying away from things that you might find offensive. Therefore, I don't think that some books or music should be kept off the shelves because of some personal opinions. There are several different books in a library, and just because one of them may find an offensive book does not mean that the book should be removed from the shelves. The reason is that someone else might find this book a good resource and @ MONTH1 needs it for something they're doing. People should know what they are looking for in the library, and if they think a book @ MONTH1 is offensive, they might stop viewing that book. This problem is similar to others around the world. For example, when you go to the mall, there are stores that you like and where you go, and you stay away from those you don't like or that @ MONTH1 finds offensive because of the items that you do. they sell. This does not mean that this store should be banned from the mall. This is because some people might find this store interesting and want to buy some of their items. I think the same reasoning goes for different books and materials in the library. Perhaps one way for a library to solve this problem without removing these books from the shelves is to survey local visitors to their city and ask them what they think about some of the different kinds of books and different styles of books. music. After completing this survey, the library could then separate these items into different categories or sections within the library. This could go a long way in solving this problem, as people could stay away from sections that they might find offensive and find what they are looking for much more easily. I know that when I sit down and read, I'm not always surprised to read the most popular topics. I love to read topics such as murder files, drug busts, biographies and autobiographies. And then when it comes to music, I listen to a wide variety of music such as hip-hop, country, alternative, rock, etc. Some people @ MONTH1 find this weird and unusual, but it just shows that not everyone wants to read and listen to the same thing. Therefore, the library should keep the wide choice of different materials and satisfy everyone.

I don't think libraries should remove any of the books they currently have. If parents or people don't want to read these kinds of books, they don't have to. But they shouldn't be deleted. I agree that some books are inappropriate and contain bad language, but it's part of the book and how the story was made. When a book is made as it is and is already published, no changes should be made to it. If a story contains a certain scene that a person thinks shouldn't be in the book, that person should put that book back in place and choose another book they feel is appropriate. Some people like to read stories with details so that they can imagine them in their mind. I know I do. In libraries they have books with inappropriate language and depicted scenes but up to a certain age. I think you have to be thirteen or older to read them, and that's a good thing because at that age you know things better and your parents shouldn't be too worried. So in my opinion, I don't think they should be removed from libraries. On the other hand, movies that have disturbing scenes should be deleted. Movies are a whole different thing from books. They show the material that is described and I don't think teens should be watching that. They can be very inappropriate and disturbing for some people like me. I wouldn't want to watch this in front of my mom or dad and especially a younger sibling or sister. Again, this is only my opinion. If the parents allow the child or children to watch this, it shouldn't be a problem. The music is not that bad. There are a lot of parents who don't want their child or children to listen to a certain type of music because of their religion and what they believe in. I completely agree. My parents at first wouldn't let me listen to music where they would just sing about sex and swear over and over again. As they got older they didn't care a lot because I didn't listen to it as much. I am a teenager and also believe that some of the music today is not very suitable for anyone, regardless of their age. Some of what they sing doesn't even make a lot of sense. In libraries, I think they should only have music that relates in some way to books. Magazines aren't much of a problem. Most magazines are about beauty and fashion advice. They have horoscopes and give advice. Lots of magazines keep people up to date with celebrities and their lifestyles. There is gossip. It is primarily aimed at older teens and adults. For teens and younger children there are more suitable magazines where they talk about young celebrities. This is my take on things. I know a lot of people don't quite agree with me but that's what I think. I also know that there are @ MONTH1 a lot of people who agree with me and they will probably give the same reasons as me to support their choice

Do you believe that certain materials ; should books, music, movies and magazines be taken off the shelves if they are offensive to certain people ? As a result, I don't believe this way. If we had to remove books from a shelf for anyone who thought it was offensive, we wouldn't have any more books on the shelf. From my previous knowledge, I know that certain materials will affect different people in different ways. I had my own experience at school. Some people don't want to say the pledge because they said "one nation, under @ CAPS1". We all have different opinions on matters; so we will all react differently. However, that does not mean that we should take away something that he or she finds offensive; others find it appropriate. Observing others in offensive situations @ MONTH1 helps to find a solution to these problems. The solution is certainly not to remove what some find offensive because many people will disagree for eternity. Censorship in libraries should be based on separation. Materials that match a category should be placed in a section. Often times, this separation helps people find what they need and not be offended. In our own constitution, it is stated that all @ CAPS2 are free ; freedom of expression in particular. All documents are written by someone with an opinion, so by taking their books off the shelves we are taking away their freedom of speech. This is how they express themselves. If someone finds it offensive, they just shouldn't read it. Removal of material may frustrate and offend the author or other readers. It's plain and simple: we shouldn't remove certain documents because someone finds them offensive. Censorship in libraries should be based on separation, not on people who are easily offended. It's based on choices. People should be able to choose what they want to read or watch without others taking it away from them. So now what do you think; Do you have to remove certain materials

Have you ever scoured the library just for that specific good book, magazine, or even CD that didn't involve inappropriate material for once ? You feel like a little kid in the mall eagerly waiting to find this toy, but it never shows up. You spend seconds, minutes, even hours slowly pacing from shelf to shelf, and eventually you find it and you open it and see the most inappropriate picture ever, or maybe listen to the most vulgar language, or even peruse it. the most shocking read to date. Would you like this to change? I visit the library every time I finish my book, I have loved reading since I was little. Lately I feel like my reading interest has waned, not because of my involvement in other things, but maybe because lately I feel like every book I pick up is offensive. For example, I went to get a new book, I was flabbergasted at the time because unlike usual, I had no idea what book I was interested in reading next. The librarian directed me to this new bestseller and told me he tackled it and it was as hard to put down as a lollipop. I checked it and after the first paragraph I felt like throwing up. This book and too bloody and I had the impression that it downgraded women, I was anything but satisfied. It wasn't the first book that I or my friends read like this, and I have a feeling it won't be the last. I just hope I could read a not so offensive book that is really worth it, but it seems like lately they are all changing and becoming too much for me, and it really upsets me. Our library seems to be overloaded with magazines which is not a bad thing because I love them. I label magazines as light and very good reading to pass the free time. I never get tired of all the pictures, all the gossip and all the jokes at the end. Lately my opinion has changed though, these magazines are starting to change and I don't like it. It seems like I can't open my page without seeing a half-dressed girl, inappropriate advertising, or even tons of personal displays of affection. Seeing these vulgar images is enough to make me not only flip the page, but also never hesitate to reopen a magazine. Music is like a drug to me, and I'm addicted to it. There's never a day that goes by that I don't listen to music, but lately the music isn't the same. I'm going to the library to check out some new CDs and it seems like everything I bother to listen to uses every swear word. I was furious after my purchase, but also disappointed that people actually sell this garbage. I am someone who listens to music to relax, not to develop inappropriate new vocabulary. I know there are plenty of good books, magazines, and music. We just need to find him. I hope we can ban these offensive, vulgar and unnecessary articles from the library. I know I would greatly appreciate it, and from what I've heard, many more would too. We want reading utensils worth reading, we want magazines our eyes won't hesitate to check out, and we don't want music that doesn't pollute our brains.

I don't think there are any materials that should be taken off the library shelves. People have the option of getting whatever they choose from the shelves, librarians not forcing them to choose the item. It's a free country and I think people should choose what they don't want. If people don't like it, read the spine of the movie or book before choosing it.

I believe there should be no censorship in the land of the free. In the United States, censorship should not exist. This country has freedom of speech where we can say whatever we want. This band has been banned in the US from @ LOCATION1 for their music. How can your music be banned in the land of the free? I think there shouldn't be any way to ban anything in a liberary, there shouldn't be. And how can we tell right from wrong if we have never seen wrong. I know there are movies and magazines that parents don't want kids to see. So don't censor it, just do it where you have to be a certain age to see that movie from a bookseller. There should be no sensorship in the land of free speech. What would we be called the land of the free if we censor everything. That's why I don't think we should censor anything in @ LOCATION1.

I think there are some materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that shouldn't be taken off the shelves if someone thinks they are offensive. Just because someone finds them offensive doesn't mean they should be taken away from others who @ MONTH1 like them. People are different, so we like different kinds of things. Different music, books, films and magazines. If you find it offensive, don't listen to it, don't read it. Listen to the music you love, watch the movies you love, and read the books and magazines you love. But just because you don't like something, don't try to take it away from those who like it. People are very different in many ways. But let someone express who they are through their likes and dislikes. Censorship has always been a problem, but I think if people would stick with what they know and love and leave everything and everyone alone, you'd be fine. I understand that some people might find certain things that are on the shelves today shocking. But if you don't like it, don't watch it or listen to it. Let go and stick with what you know and love. After all, the world is a very diverse place and we weren't all created equal.

Do you believe that if you simply remove a book from a shelf, you or your children will not be exposed to offensive material ? If you do, then you are wrong. You cannot isolate your family or other families from the world because you are afraid that they will catch something wrong. Every day, whether they read a book or not, they are still exposed to vulgar behavior. “We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you have the exact same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for us. Katherine Paterson's @ CAPS1 quote also helps in understanding the concept. If someone took a book from a shelf in their home, a public library, or maybe even a store that they found offensive at any point in the book, then there would be no more of books to read for children and even adults. In every book there is some form of material that folks @ MONTH1 are not fans of. Soon there would be nothing left. Not a day goes by without a child hearing something offensive. Even at school, where it is supervised, children bring words that they heard their parents say or things that they saw their parents do, and they share them with other children. You can't protect them from every little encounter they face. Some books are far more offensive than others, but are you going to give a child a vulgar language book or are you going to give a child a book on @ CAPS2 the @ CAPS3 running out of honey in their jar ? Most kids don't go to a library or store without super vision if their parent @ CAPS1 is paying attention to books. Therefore, their parents are unlikely to allow them to take an obscene book or magazine, and in fact they would probably try to hide it from them. If a book is put on a shelf, it's there for those who like that material. If you can't make the world of kids safe then why would you try to make a bookcase exactly the same. There are other people who might find the very material that offends you and that is fascinating, and a library is there to meet everyone's needs. It's not just for kids.

I think we should remove some things like movies, music and books should definitely be up for debate because these days people are doing things that they have never done before. For an example of music, music is a great cause of things that motivates people to do things and really get into songs. They try to do the same things that their favorite artist or actor does. I hear songs and they talk about illegal things and I look around the world I hear kids talking about these things and they tell their parents what is it? But they just don't want to tell them the truth, but once these kids grow up they will know what it is and it will be their choice whether they want to go that route or think about something else. But about the people singing that, they present it in a way that's not bad, you can do it all the time and enjoy it without worrying and in reality these kids are blind and don't know what is going on. 'they have themselves in. Additionally, many books have offensive language that kids read all the time but people don't even notice. This is how children can have problems in school because they learn a new word in a book that they never read or cannot even read because young people understand it, but they do it when. even out of curiosity, they don't know what they are doing. This is how a child becomes a bad person because he or she grows old because he or she has learned things that he or she should not have learned. I think as a good country we should create sections on what people can and can't read, and that should depend on the age of the person. Some school libraries have movies for kids to watch and it could be if you are an elementary school, college etc. But some of these movies have offensive language and appropriate scenes, which kids would want and learn to do like that. Or how they see the actors in the movie and they swear and they think it's cool because they do it too. I think elementary students should only watch pg movies, middle school pg @ NUM1 and down, and for high school we should be able to see pretty much any movie, but at the same time I think that most high school kids have to be more mature, which is probably why we still don't have the privilege of seeing a movie because people don't know how to handle them on their own. Finally, I really think they should at least some movies, music, and books because kids learn things they shouldn't learn until they get older, and those three things change the world in so many different ways, some are good but most are bad, these are my opinions.

There are a lot of issues with offensive material that is used for entertainment purposes. Sometimes these things shouldn't be on the shelves. Like movies, books, magazines, etc., they can be seriously offensive to other people of different races or religions. Censorship can be used to solve this problem, as in the book @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 it was used to keep books completely out of sight. To prevent society from being offended, or for that matter, from thinking. However, in this case it's quite the opposite, having all kinds of negative content and not caring about what he may do to other people, or @ MONTH1 damaging other people. However, this can also be argued. People who are offended by the material, whether religious or racial, really don't need to be around the material in the first place. For example, if the material is in a library, people do not need to go to the library. In conclusion, people don't need to be near offensive things if they are offended, but people shouldn't be so cruel either.

Personally, in my opinion, I have no problem with anything in libraries today. Yes, there will always be something you disagree with, but it doesn't hurt you, so just ignore it. Kids don't wander around in the adult section of the library, they go to the kids section, so there is no need to worry about them. Children mature at a much younger age these days. I believe there is nothing wrong with libraries, it is a place where you go to get all the information you can. So why delete valuable information. The library is a place for everyone, no matter who you are, how old you are, or how ugly you are. Anyone can use the library for any reason, often at school. Personally, I don't use public libraries very much, but I often come to the school library to do things or find a particular book. For example, you might find @ CAPS1 to be a horrible person that you don't want your kid to know. For me, I'm @ CAPS2, I want to learn more about my own culture no matter how bad it is. So why take this information away from me? Deleting a learning experience just because a group of people don't like the book doesn't mean everyone doesn't like it. I want to learn knowledge about myself and where I am from. Everyone is going to have their own opinions and beliefs. Overall, I think the library is not a place to take things out when everyone is welcome. It's a place to get away from it all, I think they should just leave it as it is.

I don't think people should take books off the shelves because municipal libraries have those kinds of books. People should like to read all types of books. Some people only read different books. Small children love fantasy and picture books, teens love romance, and others love non-fiction. It doesn't matter what other people think. If people take books off the shelves, what will others read? Before taking books off the shelves, you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right. Think about what would happen if you took books off the shelves. What would happen? I'll tell you, you would lose customers. If you don't want children to read inappropriate books then you should make a card that your parents give them permission to read these books. If that doesn't work, set an age limit. Ask parents to show you their berth certificate. Have a restricted section in the library. In order to get a restricted section book, have a parent sign a note stating that it is allowed. Children under thirteen should not receive magazines. If their age fourteen and over, then they can get a magazine. Music shouldn't matter to parents, so there shouldn't be any issues. If the movies are bought by parents, there shouldn't be a problem either. The other things you can find out for yourself. This is what I think should happen to books in a library. I told you how a library should work. I told you what I thought should be happening in the library. I will give you some advice. Think before you do. That's all I'm going to tell you.

I think all material should be allowed in libraries because we all have the right to choose what we want to read, listen to and watch. Even if people banned certain books from the library, others would find a way to get them. we, as the people of America, have the right to live freely, which also includes the right to read freely. When it comes to music and movies, I think we've gone a bit too far. We've made pornography easily accessible and music that promotes sex, drugs, violence, and alcohol. The only thing that keeps us from pure evil is the @ ORGANIZATION1 and their ratings on movies, music, and TV. With magazines it's a bit more complicated than the others, magazines have their own set of standards. We all know @ CAPS1, @ PERSON1, and @ CAPS2, but think of all the magazines we don't see. Those who stay behind closed doors and rarely go out.                  

<START>

 

Books, magazines, movies and music are created with great diversity. Fiction, @ ORGANIZATION1, horror, fashion, science fiction and many other categories of literature are created. There is something out there that everyone will enjoy. What would you do if you had no choice but to read, listen to, or view the material you like because someone else has a bad opinion ? Everyone has an opinion. He @ MONTH1 be in favor of something or this @ MONTH1 is not. I believe that every book, movie, magazine, and other piece of literature should have a rightful place on the shelf. To some people @ MONTH1 may be offensive, but that doesn't mean they should read it. Someone @ MONTH1 likes a job that another finds offensive. It's all a matter of opinion. A person's opinion should not affect what materials may or may not be on a shelf. If you walked into a library and the shelves were full of books, but only the books that everyone had a good opinion on on the shelves wouldn't look very full. It's hard to get two people to agree on the same thing. Imagine trying to get everyone to agree on literature in a public library. Censorship is understandable to an extent, but I think libraries should organize all of their literature into categories and sections. Within these categories and sections, @ MONTH1 people search for documents they want to see and avoid offensive documents they don't see. Libraries have rated @ CAPS1 movies. A lot of people might find movies rated @ CAPS1 to be offensive, but a lot of people might like to watch movies rated @ CAPS1. Who wins, the people who find them offensive or the people who like them? It is a difficult choice to make. I believe libraries should offer the movies and if anyone finds them offensive they just shouldn't watch them. The same goes for books, magazines and music. If you find it offensive, just don't read or listen to it. There are hundreds of different writing styles, movie plots, song lyrics, and magazine covers. They have such diversity because everyone has a different opinion of the lyrics, covers, styles and storylines. They can't censor things just because some people find them offensive. Others @ MONTH1 like them. What would you do if your favorite book was not licensed in your public library

I don't think books, movies, music, magazines, etc. should be deleted just because some people don't like them. Maybe others like them and like to read them. There should be no reason why one or more people try to remove something from a shelf in a library just because they find it offensive. Lots of people like a lot of different things and things you read @ MOIS1 affect other people, but you don't care, you just care what you want and like and what offends you. What if something you were watching, reading or listening to offended someone else, would you care ? Would you mind if someone told you it distressed them? Everyone likes different things, and others @ MONTH1 don't always agree with what will interest them

Do I think ceratin materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive ? What I'm going to discuss, do I think there are any materials that should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive ? I will also talk about my introduction, a body and my conclusion. Do I believe that books, music, movies, magazines and anything in book shelves or on any other shelf that is offensive to anyone should be removed. I think this because no one should be offended by anything. Not everyone should live offended by anything or anyone. I just explained and discussed if the offensive things on the shelves should be removed, and I said yes. I also talked about the intro, a boby and the intro

We know that anyone can rent books, movies, music and magazines from libraries. It is also known that some items in the @ MONTH1 libraries are offensive or inappropriate. While some people believe that such items should be taken off the shelves, I believe that books, magazines, movies, and music should not be taken off the shelves. People should be able to read, listen or watch whatever they want, if someone doesn't want something in their house that they find offensive they don't have to get it, and that does not mean that something that seems offensive is still not pleasant. The most important reason I think items that seem offensive shouldn't be taken off library shelves is that people should be able to read, listen or watch whatever they want. Everyone is entitled to their own preference. Some people prefer movies or music rated @ CAPS1 with explicit content. If that's what interests people, so be it. No one should have to stop renting something they want just because someone else doesn't. Also, if someone doesn't want something in their house that they find offensive, then don't get it. No one is forcing anyone to listen or watch something they don't want. It is in fact a very simple matter. It's a choice if someone wants to watch or listen to what they want, and they don't really have the right to be able to tell someone else that they can't watch or listen to what they want. he wants. If someone doesn't prefer something, they don't have to get it. Finally, just because something seems offensive doesn't mean it's still not pleasant. The @ CAPS5 example I can think of is a movie rated @ CAPS1. Just because a movie is rated @ CAPS1 doesn't mean it still doesn't have a good story or moral. There are many movies rated @ CAPS1 which have won @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 and many other awards. Another example is singer @ ORGANIZATION1. Although his music @ MONTH1 is offensive, there are still a lot of people who appreciate him. Some things that offend people can be appreciated by other people. In conclusion, no one has the right to prevent anyone from renting whatever they want in a library. People just need to go about their own business and not worry about what other people find pleasant. Some books, movies, music, and magazines are only offensive if some people believe they are. People can only choose what they want, and nothing more

Do you believe that books or any other material should be taken off the bookshelf? No, because these books or documents are not accessible to everyone. As if you have children, you should keep them and a space for the children. We can't just start taking every book off the shelf because it wasn't a good book. The reason the kids should stay and the kid's area is because they want to pick up that book that isn't intended for them. We will need reading to read a children's book. If a child chooses the wrong book, you need to explain to him that the book is not for him. Some books are @ CAPS1 for kids to read. that's why they have an area to be there. Children should not leave this area for a @ CAPS1 book. I think children should list to make music and a library their own. The @ CAPS1 book or material is not for children to read, so it shouldn't be and this place to pick up a bad book. I feel like there isn't a bad book if you don't like the book maybe someone else will. but like movies, music and magazines should not be commercially available because if it was @ CAPS1 it would not be and library and first place. Not everyone will like everything but it's just life

Should there be censorship in libraries or not? Many people have their own personal views on this subject. Everyone should know their own boundaries between what they know is appropriate to watch and what is not. Libraries should not have to collect books, etc., which they themselves have purchased in order to obtain them. Now they want them to be honored? I don't think that's very fair. Libraries should take all the dedicated material and make a part of the library where patrons cannot see from the main section and this would be open to patrons who wish to go to that specific section to consult a book or anything other than @ MONTH1 s 'applies to this section. The library was designed for anyone who just wanted to get to a place to escape the troubles of their own world and just sit in a library and read. Not everyone is going to the library for a book, some are going to listen to music, some are going to read a magazine, anything for libraries cannot put out the material that people are just going to pick up. How do they expect customers to come back if they remove material from the library ? The Internet and @ CAPS1 are far more offensive than material in a library, so that gives them the right to say, take all your offensive inappropriate material out of the library. If libraries are to do this, then all other entertainment industries should. Finally, each library should have its own control over what it thinks is best for its own institution. My opinion is that we should just move the material somewhere else in the building, into its own little wing or something. Where people could if they wanted to come in and check something, but if people didn't want to come in, they sure didn't have to. Everyone has their personal opinion on this subject, well I gave you mine

I think any book or movie should have warning signs, to make sure all people know what they're going to experience before they read or see anything. Some movies or books read or watched must also have an age limit. Some of the things people find offensive, some of the things @ MONTH1 don't and if all things are taken out of the movies or books @ MONTH1, people aren't going to see or read that many movies or books. In a lot of music, some things can be offensive, but if you don't like what they're saying in the song, don't listen to this band. There are rap artists who say things that people might not like but, you don't have to listen to them, there are many more bands and different types of music to choose from. It would be hard to remove stuff from movies and music like that because it could take a lot of what people want to see. In magazines a lot of people including I love to hear about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies that a lot of people @ MOIS1 don't know. If parents don't like children to read these kinds of books, ask them to buy a set that they will enjoy showing children.

My name is @ CAPS1 and my take on censorship in libraries is if any material found to be offensive should be taken off the shelves. I never encountered material that offended me, but maybe someone else did and it really offended him. I'm not the type to start an argument, but I am the type to say what I think and what I believe. The people are concerned about whether libraries remove certain types of books they will not be books left on the shelves for someone else. I have to say that there are other places where you can buy books next to libraries such as stores like @ ORGANIZATION1, @ ORGANIZATION2 etc. but of course, I don't read much either, but the books I read, I've never come across terrible ones. Books that tell about how people can kill themselves, or how people get pregnant, etc. can be taken off the shelves, but if you have a kid in the library, they shouldn't even be in the adult books section. anyway, be in the children's books section. I've never heard of a terrible children's book that should be taken off the shelves. Most writers are smarter than that, or at least I hope they are. Music is a whole story in itself. In my opinion, if you don't want your kids to listen to adult music, then don't let them. I know a lot of music that is bad and that I would never let my kids listen to it but I know pretty well that if I don't want them to listen to it, I'm not going to play it while they're in the room. corner. I grew up around rap music so that's all I listen to, but when I have kids I know what they'll be able to listen to and what they won't be able to listen to. Movies are the ones I have the most problems with because in libraries and other places like @ ORGANIZATION1 and bookstores they just have movies EVERYBODY can see no matter what they want. is on the cover or what it's called. Now movies with bad covers and bad titles could be pulled from the shelves, like all “ @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 ” movies . The name of the movies isn't bad, but the movie itself is not for a kid to see, so why even have it on the shelves for kids to want to see ? Magazines etc I don't have a big problem because libraries don't have bad ones but bookstores do it like 'playboy and play girl' but they usually get put back deep behind everyone else magazines so kids can't see them that only adults can. The only way a child will see them is only if you show them. I think I have said all I can say about my opinions and experiences about books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries that should or shouldn't be taken off the shelves. I haven't had much experience but maybe it's because I don't have kids yet, I guess I'll find out when I have kids. I am happy to explain my experiences and opinions to people who really care and want to know

Censorship of Libraries Libraries should not have “offensive” books removed from shelves. Parental supervision, librarian supervision, and your own common sense are three of the reasons why books should not be taken off the shelves if they are considered offensive. Parental supervision is a top priority in knowing what your children are reading. If they don't want their children to grow up being "dumb" then they should teach them to focus more on educational books. When they see their child in a row of books that they deem inappropriate, then they should remove their child from that area and take him to another area. Supervision of the librarian is also an important priority. Maybe they don't know the actual ages of the kids, but if the librarian sees them in a place they feel is inappropriate for someone their age, show them another shelf. Much like parents, librarians will try to find an educational book that will appeal to the child @ MONTH1. But, librarians obviously love to read as they are around books all day, so the child @ MOIS1 is lucky and the librarian finds an adventure book for the child, or something other than the child finds it interesting. Common sense is also a reason why " offensive " books should not be removed from libraries. Most people know how old they are and what kind of books they should read. If they are in an area of the library that other people @ MONTH1 think they cannot read, move to another area. Again, I don't think there should be censorship in libraries. If parents want their children to read books that don't "mess your brain" then they need to observe what books their child is reading, trust the librarian to show them the right books to read, and expect their child to read. have common sense.

I think @ CAPS4 is fine if you remove them. You would have to be @ NUM1 or older to remove them from libraries or stores if they are really that bad. If they're that bad they should have something on them like @ CAPS1 rated movies. I have read a few books that are really good, but kids shouldn't read them. I read this book @ CAPS3 'A @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4' and @ CAPS4 is really sad. @ CAPS4 talks about @ CAPS2 and he tells us what his mother made him do when he was little. I liked the book but @ CAPS4 was sad but I read @ CAPS4 because people were talking about @ CAPS4. Some parents don't let their kids watch certain things on TV because they think they are bad. I was watching this tv show at my grandma's house and she said I shouldn't be watching @ CAPS4 but I do. I'm @ NUM1 so I think I should be able to choose what to watch. I don't think she likes @ CAPS4 because they scream a lot on the show and she says that's why I scream. Some movies are better if they have bad stuff in them, @ CAPS4 sometimes makes them funny and that's what everyone loves. I prefer to watch a funny movie rather than a children's movie. I've already watched them though

No, the books, etc. should not be moved, because everyone can be interested. Someone might come into the library looking for one of these items and cannot find it because the library deleted them. First, there will be no reason to remove books from the library unless there are new books, etc. do not enter. Everyone is interested in different materials, books and stuff. That's why I say don't delete the items. People can come to the library looking for a book they want. If that person can find it, they might complain or take business elsewhere. Then the library could start to lose business. Second, if the library begins to lose businesses, it could be forced to close. Then, if the library closes, the people who come often will not have a place to study or work or anything. And if these people do not have transportation, they will not be able to go to another library. The owner of the library can lose money if it closes because not everyone has computers and books at home. They can come and do research and rent books. Third, some people go to the library for peace and quiet, and the library is the only place. Small children go to the library in search of books, etc. and if they can't find the book they want, they may cry. If they start to cry, people who are working may be disturbed. Then that disturbed person or people can leave and never come back and it's money wasted. Students in the school may not have the book they are looking for, and they come to the library and the library has no idea that the student will not have a book. In conclusion, here are some reasons and examples why I don't believe in books and etc. should be removed from the library. Someone may be really interested in these items and they come to the library looking for them and cannot find them.

You are the mother or father of a young child and you take it to the library. While you're at it, you see an advertisement for a new book. The sign is all bright and flashy, so you stop to read it. This turns out to be advertising for a book and some movies that you think shouldn't even be available here as they are far from inappropriate and offensive. What would you do? Personally, I believe if you see something like this that you find offensive you should say something. Talk to the librarian and state your case on what's going on. Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework is just plain wrong. What if this library has no restrictions on who checks what? So many kids could check things out like this, not even knowing what it really is ! Can you imagine your child coming home from the library and handing you a book, magazine, or movie far beyond anything they should ever see at this age ? It would be catastrophic! @ MONTH1 I have no children, but I have cousins younger. I know for a fact that if they brought home something inappropriate or offensive, their parents would have an important discussion with the librarian. Libraries should have major restrictions on what is checked out by whom. For example, my library has three different types of library cards. A card is just for checking the regular books. You can also watch movies, music and books. Then the third and final card lets you check out books, music, and movies from the adult section in a small room at the back of the library. However, even to be eligible for the third card, you must be eighteen or over. I firmly believe that if a library is carrying material that some @ MONTH1 find offensive, they should be kept in a small room at the back of the library or behind the librarians' desk. This way, no one who does not want to see the documents does not have to do so. If someone wanted to see or verify these documents, they should need proof that they are eighteen years of age or older. This would make it easier for the librarian to know who is viewing or checking documents. Anything else, what if someone finds something offensive that someone else can't? Well, I honestly think at least a couple of people should comment that it's inappropriate or offensive, before it's actually taken off the shelf. If more than one person says something, the librarian should place the book, magazine, movie, music, etc., with the other offending material where there is an age limit. This is how it is in my neighborhood library, and I firmly believe that this library is a model for all libraries that wish to have more restrictions. If all the libraries had more restrictions, it would be better for everyone. Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something very wrong with them. Older teens and young adults could do their homework or projects without having all the distractions of offensive material. In conclusion, I hope you will take everything I have said to heart. Hope you write an article about restrictions in libraries and how they would improve everything. Please take the time to read this

I think some library materials should be removed. Some people @ MONTH1 find them offensive because they might have bad things in them. Some types of music have bad language and people don't want small children to find them. If a little child saw this kind of thing, he would learn bad things. And they would say it in front of everyone and then everyone would say it. Lots of books can be read because they don't contain bad stuff. some people like to read drama books and some don't. Most books can be read. But some may contain a language and should not be aloud in the library. But they can still be there because some people might want to read them. If people don't want to read them, they shouldn't be getting them. Some movies contain bad stuff. This stuff shouldn't be there because a lot of people don't want to watch movies like that. And if a kid would come in there and have one and if he had this thing and the parent didn't care, then the bookcase could be sewn up to have this thing. So they should be taken out of the library so that people don't get them. The library can keep children's movies to watch because they're not bad. If I worked in a library, I would pull out magazines. Sports magazines would be allowed to stay in there. But a lot of others shouldn't be there because they got a lot of bad things in there and I wouldn't let people take them so I wouldn't have them in there. But sports and all that would be nice because sports are not bad for people to read. People love to read about sports because it is interesting to read. This is just what I thank. Other people might see it the other way around and they can. People are different and they will thank different things. Some people may want to read this and some may not. So it just shows you that people are different because they thank different things from other people. And some libraries have this stuff and some don't. sp if you are one of those people who like this stuff then go to one of them who have this stuff. And if you're one of those people who don't have it, go to a person who doesn't have that stuff, so you can get what you want and they can get what they want.

I have seen some really shocking books in libraries. Book that makes you worry about what would happen if a child @ NUM1, @ NUM2 or @ NUM3 looked at these books because this is where their minds absorb the most knowledge, but what if that knowledge was offensive to a race of people or a person's religion. These children are the most distant of the species. It should be censored in libraries. I tried to imagine if they had looked at any books written @ CAPS1 and other Nazi members during the Nazi rule of @ CAPS2. Mabey, they looked at a book by @ PERSON1 or other famous killers. If they saw a photo book about the huge Jewish death camps in Europe. Movies that show a war-torn battle, like @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION2, world war @ NUM4 or world war @ NUM5. The famous film 'Le @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4' a film based on the crispness of @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ CAPS5. This is my take on censorship to protect children from offensive things in or on books, music, movies, magazines. Their should be censored in all things that children can enter. Imagine the world where there was no major media on what they could put

The library is a public place. Everyone has access to the library. It provides ordinary people with information they seek to know. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. Books, music, movies, etc., it's all there. As they can all be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Genres were created for a reason. Some articles have different shapes. There are many forms of music. Classical, rock and blues are a few examples. Since music is categorized this way, it should n't be necessary for them not to be on the shelves of a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that particular genre can be avoided. You don't even have to visit a section of the library if you know he or she finds it offensive. In @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 people are assigned many rights that are often taken for granted. Freedom of expression is one of them. This is a privilege which, if taken away, would tear @ CAPS3 in part. The freedom to say what you want also includes singing. Certain music which is on the shelves of a library has the right to be there. Just because a certain group of people find the type of music offensive doesn't mean everyone thinks that way too. For this reason, any genre of music can be placed on the shelves of a library. Another freedom given to @ CAPS2 is the freedom of the press. Everything that is put on paper is legal. Criticizing the government or fantasizing about school is all legal. Books can be offensive to many people. They can persuade someone in an incredible way. Like music, books have many categories. Everything that is put inside these books is allowed to be there no matter what. Films can also be found in libraries. They are classified like books and music. The term “@ CAPS5 judges a book by its cover” is sometimes true. It can also be used with films. The title of a movie or book will tell what it is. Some movies that are not intended for children's viewing are rated @ CAPS6 or @ NUM1. These ratings help censor things to some extent. It is not illegal for a library to have a movie rated @ CAPS6. However, it is illegal to take one away from a small child. Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. All types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries. From books to video games, there are ratings and genres. If anyone is offended by these types of entertainment, they should not visit this section of the library. It is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc. in a library. As long as no laws are broken, there should be no problem.

Do I believe there are any materials that should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive ? I don't think it matters if we have music, movies, or magazines in the library. Some people like to come to the library to relax and watch a magazine or listen to music. I don't think anyone minds what other people are doing there, if they don't mind it shouldn't bother anyone else. I sometimes see people reading a book and listening to music. I don't mind when they do that. It's a way for them to drown in the world and enjoy a good book. There is only one reason why we should keep certain material out of the library. This is because some people get very loud when looking at magazines or when the music is too loud. Other than that, I don't think we should keep these types of material in libraries. I myself am a reader and I like to read in peace. So I like to listen to my music while I read. I also like to read magazines from time to time. It's really relaxing for me. These are my reasons why it doesn't matter that we have this type of material in the library

Do I think books, movies, music, or magazines should be removed from the library ? No, I don't think that should be deleted just because if you delete them you will probably lose more customers. I'll be honest here, most people love to read. I know I read sometimes to study and if they throw away the books I read to study. How would I study? Even teachers go to the library to study or even to get books, or maybe to get books for their grandchildren or children. Parents do the same. People don't understand that music helps everyone at some point. I know people who listen to music to help them cope with different things like homework, regular work, or even stress. Music helps a lot of people in different ways. If people decide to take offense at things like this, then something is wrong because after all these years there haven't been any complaints. Honestly, I've never had any movies or magazines in the library before. People do it for their children or grandchildren, I don't really see the problem. It's not like they're looking at something wrong. They mostly have not bad children's movies. Why would people want to take a little thing like that from little children? In a way that drives me crazy because I love little children, they don't hurt anyone.

Did you know that libraries contain books, movies, music, magazines, etc. ? Yes ! They have it all, if you ever need something for research or a project, go for it. But if there's something you don't like, keep going. I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive. I think if this is something that offends you, you should continue. That " something " that might offend you might be helpful to others. So, now you know if you ever see something in the library that you don't like, go. It might be helpful for you and others. If things offend you, how would the next person learn ? They won't. Don't just think of yourself, think of others in the situation as well.

I don't believe we should sencor or remove anything from the library shelves that seems offensive or inappropriate to viewers, but I wouldn't recommend it to kids who aren't ready for this kind of material until age when they are ready for this kind of viewing. The reason I say this is because I believe and know that sooner or later people will see, hear and experience this kind of viewing and / or experience at some point in their life, it has happened to a lot of people. and it will continue to happen to everyone in their life. The events that happen to many people are horrible but are still true, @ CAPS1 going around the world should be known to others and why, so that people know how to deal with the situation or at least know what to do, we should know. you have to know what to do when certain hundred-year-old events take place for example; if a race-minded person who goes about his own business walks past a group of racial aggressors and they start offending him with words, then he shouldn't worry. Because if a person is just constantly using words, you should know that they are just a weak person who is just trying to piss you off and will not do you any physical harm. There are a lot of @ CAPS1 that people don't like and do their best to hide it from others, but it would only make @ CAPS1 worse for everyone and make them clueless if some people were exposed to what some people seek to hide ; We shouldn't hide @ CAPS1 from others and prevent them from not knowing what has happened or what is happening and leaving them with no idea. I believe nothing should be withheld from people who are ready to see or know what is going on, no matter how cruel or painful it is, they should know what it is and how to take care of it. them when they experience it firsthand.

Censorship @ CAPS1 We all know that language is the foundation of human heritage. Language is spoken to mean whatever the speaker is trying to communicate. To take books from the shelves is to steal words from the mouths of many great orators. We have an obligation to keep the @ CAPS1 we created alive. If something is forgotten, it is as if nothing has happened. If nothing happened, it will happen again, for good or for bad. Hiding words from our children is wrong. If not in the written word, word of mouth will lead them to the same discoveries they would have come to if they had read it in a book. But more importantly, what's the point of hiding the truth? When many talk about tragic incidents, they say "@ CAPS2 forgets". If this is not to be forgotten, why should @ CAPS2 youth learn? There is nothing on paper that cannot be transmitted in a different form of communication. Our @ CAPS1 is written on the pages of the literature. The books we read are the property of all mankind and should be read by all to inform us of our mistakes as well as our triumphs. A commonly debated topic in the censorship world is “ The @ CAPS3 of @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 ”. @ CAPS6 is a novel that shows what life was like in one of @ LOCATION1's most racially barbaric eras. One could argue that he uses an offensive 'n' word more than once. At @ CAPS6, you could say that @ PERSON3, the @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 that stood next to @ PERSON2 was loved by @ PERSON2. A time book @ CAPS6 showing a friendship between a black man and a white man is truly a revolutionary achievement. The word 'n' was common in the @ CAPS6 period - a friendship between a black man and a white man was not. Is it really important that a child knows just one more offensive word that they'll eventually find out anyway, or is it more important that they learn that the color of the skin doesn't change a person? Don't take the opportunity for a child to learn what really matters. To take away a book is to take them all away. Censorship of a literary work opens the doors of debate to all other works ever created. The world has seen what can happen when things are censored. During the @ PERSON1 dictatorship, almost everything from the internet, to books, to newspapers, to TV shows, to movies, to music, to magazines, was censored, so only what the dictatorship wanted got through. People were brainwashed, and those who weren't raised up, and when they did, they were shot. Don't let the world come to this. We are better than that and our literature shows it. In other words, to censor the media and the literature that surrounds us, we deprive ourselves of the education and freedoms essential to the well-being of future generations. Don't hide the authors' freedom of expression, don't hide our @ CAPS1 from our children, don't let us make the same mistake as before. Let us educate our children for the future of humanity. That our @ CAPS1 does not repeat itself. Let's innovate and create a new and better world. Let us give free rein to our words. Let us let our heritage live.

Author Katherine Paterson said, “We all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf that I hate, then you have the exact same right and everyone else has the same. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. I think some documents, such as music, books and films, should not be on a shelf for children to read, but rather on a shelf for adults. I believe that every author has the right to express himself and to be accepted for it. We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to adhere to even if we disagree on those beliefs. If every book found to be offensive was taken off a shelf, we would soon be out of books. The reason is that everyone finds certain things offensive. Many children are interested in certain things and we cannot prevent them from doing so unless it is inappropriate or offends family morals or values such a religious belief. It would be good to read what your children read, watch and listen to. On the other hand, adult shelves will have a lot of different things that would be offensive to many different people, unlike children's books. Writing is a way to show a person's expressions and what they represent although it is not pleasant for me or anyone else. But what if we write a book and someone doesn't like it, then we wouldn't like it if they took it off the shelf. it would show directly to a person who has given a lot of thought to their work. Learn to be proud of what you believe. Also learn to respect others and to let children be surrounded by books, music and magazines in a safe way.

I am against censorship for good reasons. Everyone is in favor of censorship and I am from a different perspective. if you're not old enough to get a movie or a book, it's for a reason. On another note, if you are, that shouldn't matter. People should have their own choice. If they want to go out and get a movie rated @ CAPS1 and watch it with their kids, that's their own choice. Certainly not the person who chooses the movie to censor passwords and stuff. That's why they make edited CDs so people can use them instead. People have different beliefs. and that's all they believe in, that's how it should be. and if someone else with different beliefs doesn't like it then i guess they need to write @ NUM1 paragrapgh like i am doing now. People also want everything censored. in the end, there will be nothing to read, watch or listen to. So all of you who want everything to be respected, I hope you are happy when the world has nothing to do with you.

Censorship for the future children of America. Personally, I have read disturbing books and watched grotesque, twisted and disturbing @ CAPS1 movies. Not to mention all the messed up music I've heard so far in my life. In summary, much of today's music is about sex, drugs, money, violent crime, and gangs. The movies have a rating system which helps small children. Books that anyone can pick up from a public library and some deal with murder, rape, gangs, violence and the whole horrible reality of evil acts in the world. Personally, I don't have kids, but if I had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of these lyrics and he watched a movie rated @ CAPS1, I would would like to file a complaint because that's not how I want my child to grow up. With a twisted mind and a little punk vocabulary with curses every ten seconds that came out of his mouth. Also, I wouldn't want my child to kiss his mom with that stuff coming out of his mouth. But the @ ORGANIZATION1 needs to keep all of that away from the kids until they are old enough to pick it up on their own, as they have to be @ NUM1 to see a movie rated @ CAPS1. This is how it always should have been.

“I believe that documents, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. Some @ CAPS1 like offensive things they have in the library. Some @ CAPS1 sometimes would like to know certain things that are offensive. Most @ CAPS1 could be offensive for a lot of different things. Different @ CAPS1 have different things that are offensive. What might be offensive to you probably doesn't offend me. ' ' @ CAPS1 who doesn't like offensive things just shouldn't check it and @ CAPS1 who likes offensive things might check it. I just can't remove offensive stuff just because some @ CAPS1 don't like offensive stuff. Everyone has their right, but some @ CAPS1 like offended things. I read a book that offended me, but it told me how to react to the situation and how to overcome my situation. So some things @ MONTH1 offend you, but you just have to read more about it because some things tell you how to get over this situation or tell you what to do about the situation that offended you. This is why I feel that you shouldn't delete the offensive books.

Move @ CAPS1 The @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 into @ CAPS4 ! When you walk into a library or bookstore, of course, you'll find @ CAPS3 that you like and don't like. You think @ MONTH1 is not the same as someone else. Sometimes you can feel a little uncomfortable with the situation and the way things are going. People have different views on different @ CAPS3 this way @ CAPS4. You are going to meet a good @ CAPS3, a bad thing, a good @ CAPS3, a sad @ CAPS3, @ CAPS3 that you agree to and @ CAPS3 that you disagree with. I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else should not be removed if they are found to be offensive to anyone. The reason I say this is because if one of these articles offended one person, it might not be offensive to another. Different people have different interests in many different @ CAPS3s. Therefore, there should be no reason for the materials to be removed from the shelves. Especially if they don't harm anything or anyone physically. Speaking from personal experience, I have often felt offended by some @ CAPS3. I think abortions can be a bit harmful for an unborn @ CAPS4. Killing a child who hasn't experienced what you have is wrong. But sometimes what I feel can be very different from other people. So who am I to tell another person what they can and cannot do. It comes by expressing your own opinion. You cannot change the way another person thinks or feels. If you find a book or something like that difficult to manage, it's crazy. Think about the @ CAPS2 situation you might encounter that may offend you. It often happens that you disagree or have an opinion, but you cannot change or do anything about it. @ CAPS3 will be much easier and less @ CAPS2 if we sometimes deal with the @ CAPS3 difficulty in @ CAPS4

In many @ CAPS1 libraries across the country, a large number of: books, magazines, movies, and music are not provided because they are deemed offensive. I don't think this should happen as everyone is unique and @ MONTH1 finds different types of work offensive. Who chooses these objects to take out of the libraries and why should they be the only ones saying what goes and what remains? Everyone is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions. Some people are athletic, gothic, preppy, and nerdy. The library is open to anyone wishing to enter. What if the people who choose the content provided in the library don't like the scary books, then they remove all the scary books ? What if it was a person who only reads scary books? What should they read then? I bet if that person had the option to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only be horrified in the library. I don't think anyone should have the right to censor content provided in @ CAPS1 libraries. Everyone has their own opinion and interests, so everything should be open in libraries. There is a reason why @ CAPS1 libraries are called @ CAPS1. This means that it is open to everyone. There should be all kinds of different genres to play and all kinds of movies to choose from. Just because a person doesn't like a certain genre, or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience, doesn't mean they can remove it from a @ CAPS1 library. That is why there are sections in the libraries. If you can't find a certain type of suitable book, place it in the '@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3' section of your library. For example : @ PERSON1, he is a very popular author with many different audiences. His ideas are very different from most. He writes horror but displays gore and a lot of sexual content in his writing. It's his own style of writing. If people choosing what's in libraries don't find it appropriate or find it offensive, they should put it in the '@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3' sections or even the '@ CAPS3' section. It should be up to the parents of children to know what their child is reading ; not the library itself. I don't think anyone has to choose what is provided and what is not in libraries. Everyone is unique, different, and has their own opinions on different things and ideas. If you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine, or music from a library and it's the only type a certain person reads, then what should they read ? What if someone released the genre that only you love to read? What will you do then? If everyone had the choice and the right to do so, I think there would be nothing left in the libraries. All genres of everything should be available for @ CAPS1. If you can't find a suitable book, place it in the @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 section of your library to keep it open to everyone. It would just be a big @ CAPS9 for anyone who decides to pick it up and read it. You have to think about everyone, not just yourself.

Should books, magazines, etc ... really be censored, taken off a shelf in a library, just because you might find them offensive? Some of you reading this would say yes, but why? What would be the reason? So, to answer the first question I asked, my answer should be no, because a library is a public place for all ages, and each area is tagged or should be tagged by genre of book, magazine, etc. I read pretty much everything I can get my hands on myself, and for some people it's the same. Yes, I understand that if it's offensive to you you'd probably think they should censor it, but what about those who aren't offensive to ? What would you tell them? How would you explain why it was offensive ? Above all, how would you react if they held it against you? If it was because of one person or a small group of people that one of my favorite books or series got censored, in all fairness I would be ticked off enough. Books are for everyone to read, they shouldn't be able to read the books they like because they have been taken off the shelves. I think if a person really doesn't like the book and finds it offensive then should just ignore it and go looking for another book, they shouldn't have looked at it in the first place. The books will be offensive to someone in one way or another, usually a book is written to target a certain group of people e.g. what if someone finds the novels by love that many people love, offensive ? What if that was all the person was reading? Well, people who only read romance novels wouldn't have a book to read because someone had censored them and pulled them off the shelves. Books have been written to help teach, to get away from the real world, to create a place to go for a person with an imagination, to give someone hope, mystery, excitement. Books aren't something that should be taken off a library shelf, they're something for someone who just loves to read. Yes, there would be books that you wouldn't want your kids, grandchildren, nieces and nephews to read, but there's nothing you can do about it, you can't censor all the books you don't want them to read or for which they find them offensive. If you did, there wouldn't be a single book on a library shelf. So for those of you who have read this, think about it, when you pick up a book and find it offensive, do you want to upset someone else for taking it off the shelf ? You never know when this might happen to you, think about it before you go and try to make that to a book.

I don't believe that some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Should be removed from library shelves, as anything can be offensive. What if someone needed to recharge their batteries on @ NUM1 ? Well, they really couldn't, if all the books on @ NUM1 were taken off the shelves, just because someone found it offensive. Nowadays, everything is offensive to someone. For this people need to understand that it is what it is, and if you were not left out of this problem then what should you be concerned about. These times are bad all over the world. Things are going to happen that are going to shock people. As with all earthquakes in the world, I know some people are offended about this, but what if someone was in college and wanted to find out more about what happened, so maybe they can get a bunch of people and make there better lives. People are suffering and I understand it, but we are not here to judge, we are here to help the poor and the sick, to cope with what they have, and just to help them see that there is a issue. Having said that, I don't think we should take books, music, movies, and magazines off library shelves.

When I go to the library, most of the time, I'm researching a specific topic. The information I want is the facts that actually happened, or did take place. This wouldn't be possible if they censored all of the offended person's material. Leaving libraries uncensored gives us the full effect of what we read or search for. It's important for readers and researchers to connect and absorb all the information they read. That's what always interests us about what we do. Authors write the things they write, for a reason. Taking hard work off the shelves, because a little thing offends someone, isn't fair to them. Also, somebody is offended anyway, because the author is going to be offended, for taking their hard work off the shelves. As you say @ MONTH1, I am against censorship of our libraries. The way I see it is if something offends you then don't look at it

I do not agree with the censorship of libraries. Each person should be allowed to produce a reflection of their beliefs or ideas. If certain books deemed offensive were to be removed from libraries, there would be nothing left for anyone to read. If parents are concerned about what their children borrow from the library to read, they should read it before their child to see if they think it is appropriate. In my opinion, children should be able to read what they like and in doing so they can learn a lot. Books can also help children escape from everyday life. Granted, kids shouldn't always escape, or use reading to hide from real life, but sometimes they need it, too. I know that as a young child, when things weren't going so well, I could always turn to reading to distract myself from the bad things. If children are allowed to escape, they can do better with their schoolwork and with their peers. Reading can help a child develop their imagination. If a child reads a few times a day, there is evidence that this child will be more successful in life. No one likes boring people, and how can you be boring with such a large imagination? It's impossible! In recent online surveys, parents whose children can access books say their children are doing better in school and in everyday life. By reading, these children can easily expand their vocabulary. With this knowledge, they can learn with less difficulty and can excel in universities with ease. In conclusion, if some books are censored in libraries, they will no longer be accessible to children. Children need books to get away from it all, develop their imaginations, and help them in school and in life. Don't let libraries censor books!

Some documents in the @ MONTH1 libraries contain information that is offensive to others. But should they be deleted if they are found to be offensive ? Some people think they should be removed depending on the severity of the offense. But @ MONTH1 documents should be removed if it is a sex, racist, or life threatening offense. Some @ MONTH1 content contains offensive comments of a sexual nature. If this is a detected violation and the author or artist of the material has gone too far, then @ MONTH1 is a good reason for the material to be removed. It @ MONTH1 makes the person feel emotions that demean them. It @ MONTH1 also makes the person feel violated and offended. There is @ MONTH1 material containing racist comments. Racism is one of the biggest conflicts in the world today. It is something that triggers fights and arguments. It also makes people feel bad about themselves. Racism can also make people feel very hurt. So if there is too much racism in a material then that should be deleted. There is material that @ MONTH1 has offended that appears to be life threatening. Say this is a nationwide book and the author slips something that @ MONTH1 would seem the nation would be in danger, someone @ MONTH1 feels offended and wants this material removed. Material containing too much threat @ MONTH1 gives the impression that his or her life is in danger or that something bad is about to happen. They would feel like a life threatening offense and want it taken off the shelves. So, should the offending materials be removed from the shelves? Yes they should. If they were found for sexual purposes, life threatening, or had racist comments, they should be removed so that people do not feel that these offenses are life threatening, hurting or causing negative emotions.

Removing "offensive" books from library shelves is like removing the right to speak. That does not make sense. The people of this country have the right to speak. With that comes the right to make your voice heard. The opinions of an @ MONTH1 author are offensive to some, but does that mean he shouldn't have a voice? Writers get their ideas from a place where society plays a huge role in the ideas these authors bring up, removing these books will not change the way people think and feel, and more importantly, the citizens of @ LOCATION1 have the right to make their own choices ; however, if you don't like a book, don't read it. @ MONTH1 writers say things that @ MONTH1 to some extent offends one in a million people. Others see it as freedom of expression and writing. An author who writes a story that involves sex isn't trying to extend his writing and thoughts to second-graders. But if a person has a problem with the way the perpetrator sees the world coming out, their front door will show the same. Some @ MONTH1 books are fictitious, but that doesn't mean they can't find ideas elsewhere. Society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers. So when they write a book that contains " inappropriate " actions , they got it from the way people really are in the world. Banning a book from the library that contains a sex scene or provocative language in no way prevents the world from having sex and swearing. Children learn this by hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talk about sex. Reading a book about it won't change the fact that they still learn about it in so many other ways. If the books that swear were no longer on library shelves, society still won't change. There is no such thing as a perfect society. Putting a book on a shelf with offensive language doesn't hurt anyone. If a person doesn't like the way an author expresses himself through his writing, that person shouldn't check out that author's books from the library. No one is forced to read a book that offends them. Throwing away a book because of a disgruntled parent just wastes paper and intelligence. The library is not responsible for the feelings of readers. If the reader doesn't like the book, they can close it. Nobody stuck their fingers on it. Many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much effect as some would like. Banning books is an unconscious thing to do to prevent your children from learning bad things. Society shows writers get their ideas from somewhere, removing these books won't take away the way people think and behave, and if someone doesn't like a book, they shouldn't be reading it.

One could understand why some would want to censor libraries and remove all forms of crude, unwanted or offensive media from their shelves. However, you have to take into account that, as Katherine Paterson said, if a person has "the right to take this book off the shelf ... then you have exactly the same right and everyone else has the same". With that thought in mind, do we honestly think library censorship is a smart idea ? If everyone could choose which books to drop off the shelves or which music to ban, then we would have nothing left. You just can't please everyone. Are there any advantages? Of course, there are advantages. You certainly wouldn't want your child to be exposed to certain materials at a young age. But libraries should not be censored! If one, as a responsible parent, wants their child to stay away from a particular book or movie, they must take that issue into their own hands and not condemn the book on the shelf. By condemning the book, we condemn the author. As @ CAPS1, you have freedom of expression, and this also applies to the media. The author has the right to write a book that some @ MONTH1 consider to be offensive, and no one has the right to withdraw their right from classification. The paper burns at @ NUM1 degrees @ CAPS2. In @ PERSON2's classic novel, @ CAPS2 @ NUM1, the protagonist struggles through life in a world thwarted by banning and the burning of books. The story takes place in the future, however, it contains an interesting nuance that hints at the possibility that this "future" @ MONTH1 may be closer than originally imagined. To be frank, the protagonist's life is horrible, he lives in a world that forbids books, but he is quite a bibliophile. He is employed as a firefighter, not to extinguish fires, but to create them. The @ PERSON2 firefighters take on the delicate task of burning books, which is quite common. However, with the main character's love for literature, how can he burn books? Throughout the novel, the character tries to come to terms with himself and tries to end the madness, only to be kicked out of civilized society. The book is scary, but astonishing to read: it emphasizes the terrible reality of censorship. It's everywhere. Now, we certainly don't need to worry about the futuristic hell of @ PERSON2, which will come to life anytime soon. But you have to know the dangers of censorship. No one has the right to remove a book from the shelves that they deem offensive, let alone ban it altogether. The ban on books is a ban on freedom. Freedom of expression, freedom of ideas, freedom of thought. Another disutopic world that comes to mind is the world of @ DATE1 from @ ORGANIZATION1. Although, okay, our society is certainly not heading for this anytime soon, if ever: it's still a valid point. Once some freedoms are removed, others will follow. Libraries must remain fully intact, forever. Every person, man, woman and child should have ample access to knowledge. Whether this knowledge is acquired through books, magazines, movies or music, it must be readily available. Instead of banning certain media, such media should be labeled with a warning. Parents should have common sense to pay attention and the problem is solved. Censorship is bad, censorship is unnecessary, and there is a plethora of alternative means of protection against potentially " offensive " media . Thus, the case may be based on the knowledge that all forms of media must be available, regardless of the content.

There are many books that parents would not want their children to read. Some books have violence and crime, others have love and romance. But it's not the best idea to use censorship in libraries. There are many books out there that might not be good for kids to read, but it might help them make better choices in real life. Also, we cannot forget the freedom of the press. With freedom of the press, anyone can write whatever they want. They can write about good, bad, violence, crime, love, and romance. Everyone has their own way of writing and their own imagination. Without imagination, what fiction would there be for children to read. There would be nothing to write without imagination. With censorship, there would be no more books on library shelves for children to read. If libraries censored the books on the shelves, there would be no books to read because every book has something to censor. Whether it is swearing, guns, murder, love or love. There is something in every book that is inappropriate for children to read. If libraries censored the books on the shelves there would be nothing left to read and children's intelligence would drop dramatically. Children read for many reasons, love to expand their minds, and enter a world where books take place. But what children may not know is that reading also strengthens their vocabulary. As children read, they learn many new words from this book. As they read, the book opens their minds to much more than what they are used to and what they are normally used to every day. When reading, children expand their minds and also help them in everyday life situations. This is why I don't think that censorship in libraries is not a good idea. If libraries censored books and everything on the shelves, there would be nothing left for children in libraries. They would be stuck reading books where they don't learn anything. They would read the same books over and over again, they wouldn't learn anything new. There would be nothing to lay down there with. This is something we certainly don't want for our community or anywhere for that matter.

the scary book you don't want your kids to take off the shelf i think if your kids read it they would be afraid of having nightmares and you probably don't want it and if you have the right to move it , your kids will have the right to move it because they see what you are doing, they are going to want to do it so you can do it when they are not around and yes I believe some materials.

Have you ever picked up a piece of material from a library and it offended you? Would you like your children to read, watch, or hear things that are offensive to them ? I don't think any parent wants this. Think about it, how do kids access things like this? Is it everywhere or will the kids find it? Not all of @ LOCATION1's children will be protected from bad materials. Most of the time after school, the children stay home and do things instead of going out. Inside their homes, they have access to television, computers and music. They think why go out when I have it all inside? Truth be told, children hear so many harmful things from anywhere and everywhere. Nothing is censored like it was back then. Nowadays, no one cares if the materials are offensive, as long as they sell. This is not at all what it implies, everyone should want what is best for children and young teens. People wonder why there is violence, bad attitudes, crime, etc., because of everything we have access to. Schools could help prevent this problem by removing offensive materials from library shelves. It's sad what kind of material is available in a school, but that's how the generation is today. In a library, only certain things need to be done. Read, use computers, work at the table. Kids shouldn't be able to get on a computer and play games, or listen to music with swear words, or maybe buy a dirty magazine. The library should be a place of learning, work and reading. If their material is less offensive in a school environment, this is one step in resolving this issue. Censorship is needed everywhere, it would help a lot

The common phrase " knowledge is power " accurately portrays the current situation. Through censorship in libraries, which are supposed to allow free access to all media-related material, we are taking away the ability of people to empower themselves through knowledge. The reasons for not censoring media in libraries are many and include, but are not limited to, the unconstitutionality of censorship, the lack of a proper definition for " offensive " and the contradiction that censorship poses to the heart of what it is. 'is a library. The first and most glaring reason for not allowing censorship of documents in libraries is the unconstitutionality of the question. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are both protected by the constitution on which our country was founded. Censorship of said documents will effectively infringe these two rights. Authors, illustrators, journalists and the multitude of others who make up the materials available in libraries exercise their right to freedom of expression through their works. They are constitutionally protected in what they say. Note that @ CAPS1 is entitled to free speech and not free speech as long as no one is offended. Freedom of the press is the means by which they share their ideas and concepts with the world. They use their freedom of expression through the press. Censorship of library material would limit the means by which artists can share their ideas with the citizens of @ LOCATION1. It would be a flagrant failure to respect the rights of citizens. For this reason, we cannot censor libraries. The constitutional concept of human equality also comes into play. There is no adequate legal definition of the term “ offense ”. People might be offended by something as serious as a personal attack on their beliefs and personal entity or something as slight as personal disgust for certain states of mind and ideas. So, because all men are equal, we should respect the “offense” taken by all and to all degrees. This leaves every work of art, be it a book, movie, magazine, or any other form provided by libraries, open to the inconstant definition of offensive and vulnerable to feelings. personal details of each individual. If the said offense of individuals to works can mark a work as “ offensive ” and thus make it susceptible to removal from libraries, we do indeed allow citizens to infringe the rights of other citizens. This is something that cannot be authorized in our libraries. The last central question is the essence of censorship versus the essence of a library. Censorship aims to create a politically correct and non-offensive environment by limiting exposure to materials. Libraries, however, are meant to provide the public with access to works that expand and challenge the knowledge, beliefs, notions, and any ideas held by people through the works of others. Censorship cannot be implemented without conflicting with the essence of a library's purpose. If censorship were to be enacted, a library could not provide new information if someone else didn't like what was being taught. A library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretch occurred. Preconceived notions could not be overcome with the presence of factual knowledge if someone did not like the truth. In all of these ways, and many more, the fundamental ideals and purpose of a library could not be sustained by the establishment of a censorship system. Overall, we can see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system to which libraries conform. The constitutional rights of citizens would be violated, the inconstant nature of humans and the lack of a definition of "offensive" would allow people to undermine the rights of others, and the essence of what a library really is would be ravaged. We cannot, as @ CAPS1 with rights, use a censorship system

I think kids should be able to read what they don't want. Children should never be told no when it comes to urn. Plus, there isn't a bad book that your kids will find in school anyway. Why shouldn't children watch and read what they don't want? This is how we read and grow. Unless it's an adult. The witch would be the oldest law for them. haha Our children 's minds are not something we should be wasting on things they are not used to reading anyway. When a child starts to hate their job. It starts a long chain of hate for school and the books it contains

I don't think certain materials in books, music, movies, and magazines should be taken off the shelves because I think everyone has a right to say what they want to say, but I do think certain things in books, movies, and music that might be suitable for a high school student is not suitable for a primary school student. Some things can be really offensive to elementary school students, but not so much to high school students, it would just depend on what they read, watch and hear. I have never experienced anything offensive in what I have read in any book before, but I have experienced it in the music I have heard. I didn't say anything about it, I just thought someone shouldn't have written that certain song I was listening to and I didn't think it would be that bad. It's mostly in rap that I've heard that is really offensive and I think it shouldn't even have been written. But I still think everyone has the right to say what they want to say

We all have our favorite books and some we like others @ MONTH1 not. Have you ever walked into the library hoping to find your all-time favorite book that you almost forgot, or maybe a book a friend recommended to you ? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most of the books we see in our public or school libraries are books that are much loved or preferred by many. Books open a new world for everyone and should not be taken away. To begin with, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe that books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and taken off the shelves, as it might be offensive to some people due to racist comments or criticism. This is a big deal because most of the books written years ago were held a long time ago like @ PERSON1 for example, @ MONTH1 is considered offensive but, this book gives an overview of what was going on in that period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from these mistakes and make better choices in the future. Some censored books have great educational value. Everyone has a preference for books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others don't. If all the books that are bad or offensive were taken off the shelves, we would ultimately be out of books. We have the right to read any book, no matter how horrible it is @ MONTH1, plus you can go to church and read worse things that are censored in our libraries. If we could not read some books like many classics it would take away educational value from all of us. Think about all the books that we have read and learned that have the potential to be censored. Before someone launches into a book, they need to read the informative part on the back to see what it is before they start reading something that isn't right for them. I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored doesn't protect anyone, it just makes things worse. If someone feels offended, they shouldn't read it, it's their choice whether or not to read it. I hope I have convinced you that no book should be censored and that everyone has the right to read what they want.

Homosexual murders, murders, and books can all be offensive to one person or another, but that doesn't mean they should be taken down. It's like saying I'm offended by homework, remove it from @ ORGANIZATION2. Some of the most interesting books to read are about the murders, I think. I think they shouldn't be removed, otherwise no teen would read @ ORGANIZATION1. Teens love mystery and romance. I know that one of my favorite books, The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, would offend some people because it contains murder. That's certainly not to say it wasn't a good and interesting book for me. They can just look at these books and choose a different one. If you want to keep your @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION2 students interested, you shouldn't put out a book that might offend someone. By pulling out a few books, not everyone would be happy. Some kids might even stop reading because you took the best books out of the library. Every book, one way or another, would offend someone. They just need to forget about those books and read another one. I saw books in my @ ORGANIZATION2 that offended me, but I didn't tell the librarian to remove it from @ ORGANIZATION2. Another student might have loved reading this book. Everyone has different options, so there wouldn't be any books left if they took out all the offending books. The only books left would be @ PERSON1, @ CAPS3 and children's books. I don't know of any student from @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION2 who would like to read @ PERSON1 on @ CAPS3 and give a talk about it in class. I no longer know how teachers could review books ; all the books we read in class might offend someone. If anything that offended someone was taken out of the school, there would be nothing left of @ ORGANIZATION2. Seeing everyone has a different oppion on everything. It is not fair. In conclusion, books that offend someone should not be taken out of schools and libraries. They allow @ ORGANIZATION2 students to read and grow. Without some of these books, I wouldn't want to read it myself. So let's be mature adults and keep all the books on the shelves and ignore the books that offend us

Censoring any type of media like books, magazines, movies or music in a library is not correct. A library is a huge amount of information that puts common places for people to search for knowledge. When something is found to be offensive, you shouldn't hide it as if it never had been. If a medium is offensive, it should be the person looking for the information to decide whether to use it. When someone, say a child, has something offensive, the first thought is to remove it from the library or the television. Instead, just explain what they're looking at and they'll eventually figure out why it's offensive, but how does anyone know what's offensive and what's not? to simply remove it. It should be discussed or discussed by groups of people on the topic and then decide whether or not it should be taken off the shelves to be offensive. If there is a book or magazine on the shelves and it could be offensive, a decision should be made by those around that type of information to remove it from the shelves and not hide it.

Is the offending material offensive to everyone ? Does everyone think the same material is offensive? Who can say what is or is not offensive? Offensive material can be anything anyone wants to think about. Children will see this material anyway whether we remove it or not. Offensive material, such as swearing or rage, is a form of expression and stress relief. Such things can also show anger, hatred, and depression. Children will see and hear offensive things anyway. Even as it is now, parents try to hide such things from their children. it makes them curious. They will do anything to understand it. Offensive things are a part of everyday life. The more you hide it, the more children will look for it. In movies, books and music, it is a form of expression. it releases stress, rage and shows it so that @ CAPS1 is a true picture of what's going on. People can not imagine someone who is really angry in a book when he said: " ... and she said with grief and anger : " You are wrong ! You don't know what you've done! '...' You can't show foreshadowing, or showing anger. You can't see how a character really feels. For example, " ... and she said with grief and anger : " You are wrong ! You will be parochial! You don't know what you did! Death will come! '...' @ CAPS1 you have an idea of how the author is going to play the story and what the character is really feeling. You can see the foreshadowing. The author could say that a good man is dead, who was going to stop the evil, or that a bad man is dead, and the people will avenge him. In such manners, it can show anger. Some people would find the example offensive or inappropriate. Cursing me is not offensive. But, they show how the character, the writer or the singer feels when it has been written without having to declare it. Offensive material can also cause grief. It shows that someone is hurt by what happened, amplifying the story. allowing the reader, observer or listener to expect more and want more. Thus, the reader, the observer or the listener would expect more, and by the music, the book or the film. This gives interest to the material. Only certain people can agree on something offensive. Like family, friends or a group of close people. But, this applies to foreshadowing, interest, anger, grief, and sometimes passion. Your kids will see it if they really want to. So why get rid of something they'll see anyway? Something that interests them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen or make music. Why something that, yes, is offensive to some, but that would promote it and keep some

Do you think something should be taken off the shelf just because it upset someone or you didn't like it ? I'm not just because you don't like something or approve of the reading material, that means it should be taken down. If it was like this @ DATE1 there wouldn't be any reading material, books or magazines. In my opinion, if you grieve in one way or another, don't read it. Plane and simple. Because I'm sure there are thousands of books, magazines, newspapers. ect, it afflicts a lot of people everyday. I don't want to be harsh in any way, that's just how I feel. This is only my opinion. This is how I feel about this situation.

Have you ever thought about the reasons why teens change every day ? Sometimes parents don't pay attention to why this is happening, because they think their kids are upset or because they need more freedom or even because they need more time. when time goes by they stop and think about what happened to my kids why do they change so much? but they don't know why we behave like this. you have to stop that, because we are changing because of what we see in magazines, movies and books, and also music; sometimes the music has offensive words that we learn. but also music, books, magazines and movies are good, but when they do not contain offensive words or bad things. sometimes they affect us in a good way but most of the time they affect us in a bad way because we are learning bad things. Sometimes little children read books with bad and offensive words. I remember when my friend and I were @ NUM1 years old she started reading books with offensive words and her mom got mad at her. after that, she started to curse and curse her mother and her mother felt bad, but she didn't know why her father was acting badly. the next day i went to their house and told her mom she read bad books and watch movies with offensive words, and i told her mom where she hid all those books and movies. when she got home i was there and her mom had all the books and movies on her and she gave me a bad look and she told me i was a bad friend because i got it Told her mom, I started to cry because she makes me feel bad but she didn't know I was doing it for her for the good. before moving to @ LOCATION1, she went to my house and she said "I'm sorry because I treated you like this", and I told her I did it because I loved her and because that she was like my sister since we were little. we started to cry; now we're still best friends. these days little kids now everything and it's because of what they look and see. you can help us by taking all the swear words and offensive words from books, movies and magazines. help us to become someone important in life.

Okay some books can be really offensive and some magazines can be bad like this one sports magazine I read was about some athletes and their accidents. as one article was about @ PERSON1 playing basketball and he had stomach flu and he was having trouble playing because he had to use the toilet a lot. on themselves ”. it's bad! And another thing why libraries have books that contain sex stuff. There are a few books that are like that, for example theirs, this book called "waking up" and it is about a girl who is dragged into the dreams of other people like there was this girl who had a dream and it was sexual i thought wow why is it book here. There were also a lot of curses, I enjoyed it but think it should be removed from the library. Because there are children who are not of age, so they shouldn't be reading them. I don't know that's all I have to say right now, if not just watch what your kids are reading these days you might get upset

Katherine said if everyone had the right to take a book off the shelf, there would be no more books. I think what she is saying is that a lot of people think of a book that is inappropriate, but in another person's eye the book might be appropriate as well. Censorship is big no-a-days business. No one wants young children to read about drugs and / or violence. I have a lot of opinions on this issue. First I'll explain why I think books, or movies, or whatever, should be taken off the shelves. Books, films, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves to be inappropriate. Books and movies are inappropriate because they contain drugs, sex, violence, and many other things that young children should not be inclined to watch or read. I know if I were a parent I wouldn't want my young child to read about violent murder or gangs. The other thing about censorship is that it's people's choice to read an inappropriate book or watch an inappropriate movie. As a growing child myself, I didn't really like reading anyway, but the books that were sometimes the best were the ones that contained violence. Even if the @ MONTH1 book is inappropriate, the child should still have a say in what he reads. This is where my next thought comes in. You should also think about children who are mature. Children who are mature, and this is just a hobby to read, @ MOIS1 has run out of books of their style to read if they were all "off the shelf." This also applies to parents. If they have a book at home, the child could easily pick it up and read it there. What bookstores, libraries, and movie theaters should do is put age limits on books and movies. I know for movies rated @ CAPS1 there is an age limit, but for explicit books I don't think there is an age limit. They could also maybe even get a letter or a note with the parent's focus on it, so the kids can get the book or magazine. Maybe the parent should even come and pick up the book or movie for the child. Libraries, bookstores, or movie stores could also easily put a disclaimer on the side of the cover to show that the @ MONTH1 book is inappropriate for some. What children read affects only two people at most: the child and the parent. If the parent doesn't care that the child is reading or watching an inappropriate movie, that shouldn't be a problem. Therefore, I think in order to hold back buying and selling books, there has to be the possibility of getting the wrong books. I think even though the @ MONTH1 material is self-explanatory, kids, with their parent's focus, should be given the ability to check out or buy almost anything. After all, the @ MONTH1 book is about violence, drugs, or sex, but kids still read, which is always good.

I agree with this topic, some of the material posted on the shelves of our local library is inappropriate or sometimes valgar. Way Too Much @ MONTH1 people get away with way too much stuff these days. Our society in which we live is a total wreck and a total and utter disaster. Something must be done to put an end to this madness. Someone would think that if a librarian put an inappropriate book on themselves, it is inevitable that a child or irresponsible person would find the book @ CAPS1. Yet we still see children reading or watching a book, type of media or entertainment that is not suitable for their age group. Sometimes adults find books they don't like, why put them on your person for public display? This is a question to which I have not yet found a solution. I came home from school a few days ago and heard this hip-hop music coming from my nine year old sister's bedroom. I started listening to the lyrics and they were absolutely horrible, @ CAPS1 was singing about drugs, sex and alcohol. I went to her room and turned off @ CAPS1 and asked her where she got the @ ORGANIZATION1 from. She replied " the library ". This is just another example of what I'm talking about. If a nine year old can see a @ CAPS2.D. like that, so imagine what is possible for me at the age of sixteen. Adolessence doesn't need these kinds of thoughts and words in its vocabulary. I'm just scared for the next generation; what are they going to listen to? What are they going to read? And @ CAPS1 isn't just the library, @ CAPS1 is everywhere ! We cannot even live a day of our life in this society without hearing something bad on the radio, television or even in public. Everywhere we turn, there is something bad or wrong. So we have to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our actions a bit. We must stand up for what is appropriate and what is right

I don't think we should take books, music, movies, magazines, etc. of our libraries for many reasons. It's the real world and the things you read or watch in a movie @ MONTH1 are something you don't want your kids to read or even see. Life is about learning new things. To learn more about these ideas, you read them or usually see them somewhere. The only way for me to remove any of these items from a store is if they are going to seriously harm or negatively affect people. If I walked into a public library and saw a book about a girl cutting herself or killing someone else, I would be the type of person to turn away from it; even thought that is what many children are reading today. Basically, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics. If you were a parent who feared your child would read this stuff, welcome to life. Most of the books have a true story behind them and I think everyone has to learn this stuff at some point in their life. Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read. Plus, everyone listens to music today. We find music as a way to relax and have a good time, whether in the car or at a party. A lot of songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean you have to listen to them. A lot of old people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs, but that's what a lot of children listen to today. What a lot of people don't see is that these songs have real meaning behind them and it really is a way of life. Finally, I believe that magazines, movies and any other type of media should not be removed from libraries. Many people turn to magazines to relax and learn about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete. We watch a movie to relax and have a good laugh every now and then. No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our employees, even if some @ MONTH1 think they are inappropriate. I firmly believe that moving books, magazines, movies, music or any other type of media would have a negative effect on a lot of people. You would take away the sources of entertainment and the means of learning from people. How would you feel if you one day went to your local library and most, if not all, of the materials had been removed ? What would you do if you no longer had any of these documents at your disposal?

I believe the book none of us read. I think it shouldn't be on the shelves of a bookstore, if the adult reads it, no child should be allowed to read it. In addition, some of the music that is on the shelves should be removed from all stores. Kids under @ NUM1 shouldn't have any way to get some of this centerpiece music rated r shouldn't be on shelves for little kids to hang on to. Now let's move on to the movies that star in some of these shows. No child under @ NUM1 should be able to see half of the things that are shown and movies, because no child should be exposed to such things that adults are most likely to be exposed to. This is another way for young children to do half of the things they do. The people who make certain films have to think of the children how they would act towards the ones they make. Most of the magazines that are sold today give kids a bad idea. When magazines are filled with a lot of stuff he says she says things the kids around the world just think is clear or allowed to do that's got the wrong message out to young children. And I know you are wondering how is that true, kids these days listen to what they think is right and half of those magazines make it so real.

No, as a ketazine @ CAPS1 I don't think any material needs to be removed. There are many reasons why I feel this way and I hope that after people read this they will agree with me. Here are three main points supporting my opinion and I plan to list them below. The first and for the most part is the fact that it is @ LOCATION1. @ LOCATION1 is meant to be the land of the free and the home of the brave, or at least that's what the national anthem tells me. So for me, if someone removes a book or movie from a library because they find it offensive, they are trying to take away one of my rights as ketacin @ CAPS1. The right they play with for me is the right to freedom. I should be free to be able to walk into a library and pick up any book I want. I should be free to go to the movie store and find and rent any movie I want on the shelf. If they put away a movie or a book if they get to where I can't access it, then they're disturbing my freedom, and that's something I can't stand as @ CAPS1. I should be free to read or watch whatever I want. Which brings me to my next point. This point is simple and logical. My second point is that people have the choice of reading or watching the movie. It is not because it is there that they should read it or watch it. If someone doesn't like a good book, don't read it. If someone doesn't like a movie, it's good for them, don't watch it. It's pretty straightforward in my opinion if someone doesn't like this book or movie then just leave them alone and don't disturb them. They shouldn't have the right to spoil it for everyone. Just because one or two people, or even twenty people find a book offensive, does not mean they have the right to take it down. There are @ MOIS1 five million other people who love this book so why ruin everyone just to make a few people happy. They have the right to say no and not to read or watch the film, but they are not allowed to say I can't. Eventually people say that said book or movie should be taken out because a child might get it and it is not suitable for children. Well I have to say it is the job of parents to make sure that a child doesn't read or watch something that they shouldn't. If my child gets his hands on a book that is said to be bad, it's parents' job to tell them to put it back. People do not have the right to completely delete said book or movie just because a child could get it. So that's my opinion on this little affair. I don't think libraries should be censored. I think we all have the right to make our own decisions and that we have the right to read or watch whatever we choose. It's not fair to throw away a book just because a few people don't like it. Hundreds of others might like it, and like I said before, if someone doesn't like a certain movie or book, then don't read or watch it. Don't spoil it for everyone though.

A lot of people have different views on different types of things. There isn't much that can be helped with this. No one can ever make everyone happy. It is an important part of life. I don't think they should remove materials from libraries just because some people find them offensive. You can't make everyone happy, some people like these materials and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. The number one reason they shouldn't remove offensive material from the library is that you won't be making everyone happy by doing this. Just because some people take offense at certain things doesn't mean everyone does. If they don't like it, they don't have to read it or listen to it. They have libraries so you can choose the books (and other materials) you like. There you have the choice. There are a lot of books that are in libraries all over the world. People are going to be crazy whether they are there or not. Have you ever heard the saying " @ CAPS1 doesn't judge a book by its cover ?" " @ CAPS2, well, that might also be a reason people want the materials removed. They might see a " suggestive " blanket or something, and they might be totally offended. Just because a book cover might offend people doesn't mean they should remove it. The second reason why offensive material should not be removed is that it is enjoyable for some people. There's a reason it's in the library, and that reason is that some people like it. If there was a book or magazine that had never been released, do you think they would keep it? No. I'm pretty sure if it was never checked they would get rid of it. Obviously, someone has to read it, listen to it or watch it. People are offended by things every day. Removing "offensive" material from libraries will not help much with the problem. It @ MONTH1 helps a bit, but there will always be people who take offense so easily. The third reason why they should keep the documents is that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Just because some people think there is offensive material in the library doesn't mean that others think so. For some people, removing things like this would be like forcing children to wear uniforms in school. It takes away freedom. We live at @ LOCATION1. @ LOCATION1 is supposed to be a free country. It is really not a free country when people take books and movies because they are offensive to people. I have news for you. If you don't like @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1 won't read it. There is no harm in keeping materials on the shelves. Either way, someone is always going to take offense at something. The world is not perfect, and it never will be. Taking material off the shelves because it is offensive to some people won't make the world a better place. People are going to be angry or angry no matter what happens

Some books are offensive, but not all. Some libraries have started censoring their book collections by removing those they think are offensive. I think there shouldn't be censorship in libraries. One of the reasons I don't think there should be censorship in libraries is that tons of good books are lost because of it. Some libraries do not offer @ PERSON1 books because it uses profanity. They shouldn't eliminate the books altogether, they should just warn people about the language. A second reason I don't believe in censorship is that some books on different religions are being suppressed. I once saw a librarian throw away a book just because it was about religion @ CAPS1. It was a horrible action because religion @ CAPS1 is extremely interesting and now a lot of people will never know. A third reason is that they @ MONTH1 end up offending some people by deleting a book. I once heard of an @ CAPS3 family complaining about a library because they deleted a @ CAPS3 religion book. I found this upsetting because everyone deserves to have access to the books they want. I suggest that instead of censoring, libraries separate books by different subject and genre, then put up signs warning anyone who enters that section. This way everyone can get the books they want. Libraries would also not have to worry about people being offended. I think there shouldn't be censorship in libraries. Some libraries began to censor their selection of books by removing those they thought were offensive. Some books are shocking, but not all.

Over time, other people have found it difficult to censor or ban content they consider offensive. It's @ MONTH1 either how they were raised, or just what they believe. I don't believe it should be for anyone to say what should and shouldn't be censored for anyone other than themselves. Everyone has a life, and in this life we create our personal opinions and beliefs about what is wrong and what is right. We are completely unaware of the existence of many people throughout our lifecycle, and saying what should be forbidden to everyone is almost like pretending that you know the morals, beliefs and customs of everyone in the world. world. If I ever come to school and bring a book with material that I think is relevant and not just pure exploitation, then I should be able to read it as long as I don't influence others on their own. will. Let's say another student sees me reading this same book and grew up in a home that taught him that the situations and content in my book are too offensive, I don't think he should be able to create a ban on this book simply because of his own upbringing. There is such a thing as mass agreement, but there is also a thing called mass ignorance, and to say that I know what should and should not be shown to others is completely ignorant of me. I think the only censorship allowance should be from parent to child. This is the only situation in which someone should have authority over someone else, as they have undeniable duties as parents, and they can say what is right knowing that they are creating a child for them to do. 'he thinks what's wrong and what's right on his mind

At Jefferson'vill High School, we are not allowed to take a book off the shelf if there is a book that doesn't suit you like a bad movie. It's like having a bad lunch, you don't go there to have it, so why have a bad book or a movie

Censorship is when a group of people agree that a certain book, song, movie, or magazine is found to be offensive in any way. It is mainly parents and educators who find these materials such as books offensive and do what they can to have this book removed from school libraries. Censorship originally started during '@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2' in @ LOCATION3 with @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. It was used to hide information from the public by removing all recordings for public use. In @ LOCATION2, we are a democracy, but we always choose censorship to hide certain information from certain people. In the opinion of some parents, books are excellent and educational for children, but in the opinion of other parents, books do things like promote homosexuality, use false language, or even show drug use. . Most of these books don't try to promote these things too much, but they are only part of the story. So pretend that we are hiding all the bad events or situations in the world from our children. They have no knowledge of this part of life, so what happens when they step into the real world and grow up? We can't just hide drugs from them, we can read them and teach them about the harms drugs can do to someone and how to avoid them. If we send our children to this world without any knowledge of drugs, things will get out of hand. The majority of these books contain things that are " harmful " to children, but they teach lessons that parents don't think about, they just think of what is written on the paper instead of the overall moral lesson that the story brings. to a child. If a story has wrong language, our child will ask us what these words mean and we will tell him not to use them and what they mean so that the child will know that he should not repeat them. If not, they can go to school and another child will tell your child to say these words and your child (not knowing the meaning of the word) will come out and say it and be given a detention or even a suspension. Personally, I don't want my child to be detained or suspended. Censorship is a growing problem in @ LOCATION1. It can do good things like hiding actual sexual interactions from children which should be hidden from children anyway. Censorship can also do the bad things I discussed earlier that do a child more harm than good. When asking your opinion on sensoriality, always remember what is best for your child, and knowledge is always better than ignorance.

Going to the library is one of the best ways to explore new things. However, some items are not suitable for everyone. Some books, movies, magazines, and music should not be viewed by everyone. One way to solve this problem is to have an adults-only section. Removing some material from the library would not be in the interest. All popular material should be available at the library. Many bestselling books would not be read for children, but they would be fine for adults. This does not mean that these books have to be taken out of the library. Children should, however, be prevented from viewing explicit documents. Having a section in the library from which only adults can rent items would eliminate this problem. People under @ NUM1 should also be prevented from browsing these documents. Having a children's section in the library would also keep them away from adult materials. The library must be user-friendly. People who use the library often pick up a book without knowing what is in it. When inappropriate material is inside, a child may innocently read or see something they are not supposed to see. Parents shouldn't have to worry about their kids seeing inappropriate images or text. They should feel safe letting their children browse through all the books in the library. Librarians should also ensure that materials intended for adults remain in the hands of adults. Making children and their parents feel safe and welcome is an important part of the library. Removing adult material from the library is not a good idea. This would reduce its popularity. Everyone has different interests and they want to look for them in the library. The safety of children is also important. Ensuring that children cannot reach these materials is a concern. Having separate sections for adults and children could solve this problem. Not allowing anyone under @ NUM1 to view explicit documents would also help. Keeping the library full of information but still safe for children is the ideal situation

I think not all books should be banned, but some books should. For example there are a lot of good books that are banned because @ MONTH1 has a bit of swear words but i think it's ok i mean it's not like the kid won't hear the same words , maybe even worse if he turned on his @ CAPS1. But if a book is about certain things, it should be banned, like hatred against other races, or it speaks negatively about someone's religion. For example, I read a very famous book called The @ CAPS2 of @ PERSON3 by @ PERSON4. It was a really good book but for some reason it was banned in my @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS4 so I couldn't verify it. I had to go to @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 to get it. I don't understand what is wrong with @ PERSON3's @ CAPS2 that it is banned by @ ORGANIZATION2. This book @ MONTH1 is about a mischievous youngster who runs away, does a lot of different crazy activities, and even smokes, but it's no worse than what we're exposed to on @ CAPS1. If I were an administrator in an @ ORGANIZATION1, I would look at what the meaning of the book is and what it is trying to express. For example, if a book is offensive to someone, such as a book written by @ PERSON1, that part should not be played aloud on the shelf. But if this is a book about @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 and @ ORGANIZATION3's take on slavery, that would be good. Because the book @ PERSON2 is more hateful than anything, for example it promotes @ PERSON2 and that's not fair. But the book on @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 and @ ORGANIZATION3's take on slavery is part of our history, it shows different ways of thinking back then that we don't really know if they were right or wrong. , that's just what they believed. So what I'm trying to express in this article is don't hate a book because maybe the language it contains or the events in it @ MONTH1 is not what it is with you agree, but judge the book for the message it tries to convey. I hope you will agree with me on this point. But if a book is about certain things, it should be banned, like hatred against other races, or it speaks negatively about someone's religion. I expressed my opinion on this, hope you agree with me and maybe you can convince @ ORGANIZATION1 that they need to review what kind of books we keep on our shelves and what kind of books we remove from our shelves.

Wherever you go these days, you see violence in every store all over the world. The children who grow up in the world are our future and they see this negative outcome. Many children and young adults thrive on the offensive content the world offers. I think what is offensive should be taken off the shelves. And sold in stores for adults twenty-one and over. If people are selling shocking things in stores where they allow young teenagers to buy these products, then we are only putting ourselves in danger. I was just in a bookstore the other day and saw magazines that weren't appropriate. I thought to myself how could they sell these kinds of magazines. Music, movies, and magazines shouldn't even be sold in a bookstore, which is why it's called a bookstore. It's not called a movie, music, or magazine store, they call it a bookstore for a reason. If students read books or listen to shocking music, they will grow up thinking that is okay. Be like that too or treat someone differently because of who they are or what they represent. I'm not saying take all the books out of the store, just take the shocking one and have a twenty-one or older sign. So the kids don't end up getting their hands on the book and learning something they shouldn't. When I was young, I went to the bookstore all the time with my mom. I would pick up any book and start trying to read. Most of the time, my mother would take the book from me. Because it was offensive, I didn't know that at the time I was just a little kid. In today's society, children are growing up faster than they really should and that is not a good thing. Children should be able to be children and read children's books. Guess it doesn't really matter to middle school and high school kids. Because these kids really don't like to read at all. The children we have to watch are those in elementary school. Because these kids really want to learn to read. And if we put a drug book on a shelf, these kids will read it. And these kids will learn more and be curious about what effect this drug has on you. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what I say because people are going to keep making books. Regardless of the type of book, it all depends on how much money they can make. It doesn't matter if it's a negative or a positive book. the business wants to make money and so does the author.

There are many different subjects which could be offensive, @ CAPS5 is simply up to the person's personal judgment. In my opinion, I don't think the documents should be deleted because not everyone has the same views or opinions. If someone is from a different country or a different religion, topics like abortion and racism will be viewed very differently. I think having a variety of topics will help develop different thoughts and make readers of the material see things in a different way. When I grow up and if one of my elementary school children brought home a book on abortion, I would be worried. Honestly, I don't believe schools would leave inappropriate topics for younger kids to read books like that. @ CAPS5 is a little different with a @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 student. Their maturity level will be mature enough to handle the material and I don't think @ CAPS5 is good for schools to remove something that might actually help someone. In the book "A @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5", there are many detailed events that occur. Some might say that @ CAPS5 is too graphic for kids, but the reality of @ CAPS5 is that events like these happen in society today. @ CAPS5 really opened my eyes and I am extremely happy to have read @ CAPS5. This realization made me want to help these children who grow up in homes like the one described in the book. I believe that @ CAPS5 had the same effect on other people as well and some children might even grow up to help others in this horrible situation. Libraries should be able to have a variety of different books. I'm not saying though, that they should have books on murder and say @ CAPS5 is good, but books that will help broaden children's minds. @ CAPS5 could even change their lives. Some books are a sensitive topic, but who has the right to tell someone something they should believe? @ CAPS5 would mean more to someone if they found their own way and their own beliefs and then people tell them what they should and should not do or believe. I also read a book recently titled '@ CAPS6', @ CAPS5 talks about the government granting @ CAPS6 ability to your kids, then body parts will go to those who need it. @ CAPS5 is sort of cruel in a way, but the topic the author is trying to get across is not. A quote from the book is: "On the one hand you have people who kill doctors who perform abortion for the right to life and on the other you have people who get pregnant just to sell their fetal tissue" . @ CAPS5 states that everywhere you go people will disagree and agree on things, but not everyone will believe the same. @ CAPS5 shows that just because one person thinks one way is good doesn't mean another will. The book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes to different points of view. Racism, abortion, abuse @ CAPS3, relax your kids, whatever @ MONTH1 some people will support @ CAPS5 and some will not. I think @ CAPS5 is a time for kids around the world to find out for themselves what they really believe in and picking up "offensive" material from @ CAPS2 libraries isn't going to help anyone. My opinion on this subject strongly advises to leave the material alone because for there to be a book on @ CAPS5, the author had to have a reason to write @ CAPS5 and honestly, what better for the future than generation of children based on their own true beliefs

From the start, there has always been someone who is offended by certain media. Books, movies, and music have been central to the topic of this controversy. There have been arguments about it so serious that it went to court ! People who were upset by the media instigated some censorship on these materials. I believe there should be no censorship in the media. I think there are books, movies, and other media that can be offensive to someone or a group of people. That's why they should have labels or at least a description on the back of these products that explain what might irritate someone. If something is considered too vulgar for the public to see, then they should have it somewhere more inconspicuous, but not be taken off the shelves. I don't agree that media materials should be taken off the shelves because they are offensive. The media is all about someone's free speech and tries to share it with the world. There are approximately @ NUM1 billion people in the world and at least one of them is bound to enjoy the same type of media as you. A prime example of media material that is disputed every day in all parts of the world is a book called the Bible. The Bible is considered one of the oldest books in the world and is still in printing. People of different religions can sometimes find the printing of Bibles out there offensive religious books and there is always great controversy about it. All of these movies and books are awesome because they are different and free! The world needs people who challenge ideas and religions. Every person in the world is unique and I think it's great that everyone gives their opinion to others so that they can have a new perspective on the subject or at least contemplate it. The company has already put parental warnings on CDs, put ratings on films, and labeled books as disputed. All of this prevents the public from finding new ideas to compare and forming opinions. I believe in the freedom to think because it's the most precious resource we have, it's what sets us apart from each other. May the media be free so that men, women and children around the world are unique and wonderful ! Censorship will be challenged in the years to come and I will help challenge it so that everyone can be free and happy.

Books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries should be the appropriate material. But in some cases, it's good to have offensive literature because people can learn from it. But there must be an age limit to check these items. So I think we should keep offensive literature on the shelves. There has to be some magnitude of what we leave on the shelves. Books, books and more books, there are so many books and many other types of literature in libraries today. Libraries are a place of silence, and for some people it is boring. So like me when I enter a library I go to books, or maginzes which seem very interesting to me. Although they @ MONTH1 seem interesting to me, others @ MONTH1 find them offensive. Like it's a comic book where I say something that someone might offend. Libraries cannot appeal to everyone who walks through the doors. Just because someone doesn't like the offensive stuff in there doesn't mean they should take it out. Because maybe there is someone like me who likes those kind of books or magazines. There is offensive stuff all over the world, so you can't avoid it everywhere you go. I believe there is a good result in keeping offensive literary material on the shelves. I think keeping offensive material in libraries @ MOIS1 has a good reason for a very good reason, learning. Like I said before, @ MONTH1 is offensive to some people, but to others it is not. So, some people might like to know more about offensive things. @ MONTH1, even though they never knew the things on the books. They @ MOIS1 also never know what's in those books unless they keep them on the shelves. They should have a section where offensive books, magazines, music and movies go. If some things are offensive put them on the shelf, and they must be @ NUM1 years old to check if they are on that shelf. Yeah, @ MONTH1 will be a drop off to keep offensive stuff in the libraries. But you can't hide from it all your life. So if you want to go out into the world and learn it the hard way, go to the library. You can pick up a book to learn more about it and how to deal with it. It's just a part of the live, there is offensive material everywhere. You cannot be immune your whole life. So in my biggest opinion I think we should keep these offensive material in libraries it could be a learning experience

I disagree because young children should not be exposed to certain offensive books. However, I believe that books should not be deleted or censored in libraries. because they will separate by washing bad things and it will be a bad idea   

<START>

 

I think library censorship should be relevant. As I think if someone wants to consult an adult book, they should be required to show some ID at the office. Many children take the opportunity to rent books and games that they know parents would never allow. An encory system should be a fairly straightforward arrangement for public library systems. Private libraries can do whatever they want; they are not subject to any state law. On the other hand, public libraries are governed by state and city law, they should not be able to show adult things to children. For example, in many libraries around the @ CAPS1.S all books called manga or anime books show a lot of partial nudity and other graphic elements not suitable for young children but only rated @ NUM1 +. I think there could be many changes in library systems, it's your choice whether you want to change them or not

I don't believe materials in libraries should be censored. If parents don't want their kids to read or listen to inappropriate things, they should be more careful about what they're doing. If parents watch their children more closely, they will be able to control what they are doing. There are a lot of bad things for kids to read, watch and listen to. Parents need to do a better job of teaching their children what they can and should also watch, read or listen. It's not often when you go to the library that you find something inappropriate, unless you are looking for something inappropriate. It is very easy to tell what is right and what is wrong. Most of the time in a library, the more in-depth books and magazines are kept separate from children's books. This is, for me, the way it should be in all libraries. In all the times I have been to a library, I have never come across something inappropriate. A library is a place for people of all ages, it should not be limited to just one age group. If libraries were censored, more people would be upset. The same would be true if a store stopped selling your favorite product because someone didn't like it. Many adults probably wouldn't go if the library was censored. The library would then become a place for most children. Most small children don't even go to the library, so they would become practically useless. In all my years, I have never once heard someone be deeply offended by something in a library. Whether in a magazine, on the news or by the word mouf, I have never seen a complaint. Most parents have good supervision of what children watch or read. These parents should not be deprived of their privileges to watch more adult things if they wish. Just because one parent was too irresponsible to watch their child doesn't mean all parents should be punished. The library is a place for people of all ages. That is why the library should keep material for people of all ages and not just for children. The bottom line is that if people don't want their kids to watch inappropriate things, they should watch them better. They should also teach them the difference between what is acceptable and what is not.

Censoring books in libraries because a certain group of people dislike them and find them offensive is just not fair. A good library is diverse and has something that everyone can enjoy. A compromise would not be as difficult as some might think. Simply regulating books and other products by creating age limits based on the content and maturity level of the books would be a great alternative to censoring the books themselves. Take an author like @ PERSON1 for example. His books contain offensive subject matter and foul language that would obviously not be considered acceptable by most young people. That being said, censoring the language of books wouldn't help. If a younger person has the mental capacity to read a book like @ PERSON1, they will have no problem making inferences about what has been said, and the ideas of the writing will come true. The other fact is that taking adult-level books out of libraries altogether is not a possible solution either. If you remove the diversity of your product, you will also lose the diversity of your customers. For example, think of a movie store. If the only movies sold were @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2, there would be a lot less people who would want to go to this store, because then it turns into a children's store. Even censoring movies wouldn't be effective because you take away the art of having unfiltered movie. My simple solution is therefore obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity of content, so why not books. Books that deal with more controversial content should not be placed in shelves next to books by young readers, and they should have a tag indicating that the specific @ MONTH1 book contains material that is not suitable for a person younger than. a specific age. People who try to censor entertainment and look out for the best interests of those close to them are perfectly fine, but you can't blindfold them forever. We were all on the same planet and we are all reaching the Reality Realization Age.

I believe if you let people take things off the shelves that they don't like, there's nothing left. I thank this because there are a lot of parents who don't want their grandchildren to see or hear it. This is because they might be pressured to do the wrong thing and get in trouble for it. Then you have parents who don't care what their kids are up to as long as they leave them alone. Then you have others who are very overprotected. Yes, I think there is something that should be taken off the shelves as they are very interpreted. They are because they talk about drugs and alcohol and try to get young children to try it and get addicted to it. This is why they can make more money out of it and these children end up being heard or die from it. All some of these companies are trying to do is make money from the kids because they make the bottles or the cantaners cool. Most of the time you will have kids going there, but there are some kids who don't because they don't want to have any issues or heart on their own. There are certain songs that shouldn't be allowed to be played because of certain things they say. There are people and parents listening to it and with kids in the car, then their kid will go to school and sing it and make fun of it. I think there are a lot of things that should be different, but they're not because businesses are just happy to have the money. They don't care how to buy it as long as they get the money for it and it's not the right way to look at it, you should care about the lives of the people and their families. Then you have magazines that contain uniperated pitchers. They're doing it because they're trying to get guys to buy them just for that pitcher that's in there. They want him because she's a very classy girl with just a swimsuit or maybe nothing. That's why they put it there to get their money out. Most of the girls in there are models and they are very sweet, but sometimes there will be a little boy who takes his dad and then he takes him to school and gets in trouble for it. So his partens are enbeist because they didn't know he had done it. That's why I thank that there are some things that shouldn't be on store shelves. You will have parents who will get it and leave it sitting and their kids will come in and then could take it to school. You should never leave anything that you don't want your kids to have available to them. This is why I believe this and what I thank for it

Do you think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that might be offensive should or should not be removed from the shelves ? I think they shouldn't. All kinds of people buy books or movies and they all have different types that they like. Companies that make books, movies, music, and magazines would lose money if people couldn't find something they like. and if they don't have the money to do what they're doing, then they'll stop doing business. They you might be unlucky for what you are looking for. All kinds of people buy things they like. How would you like your favorite candy to be taken off the shelves because it has offended people ? Well, that's what they feel when it happens to them. What would we put there? Stores must have something to fill the shelves. Would they put in more candy to make the world bigger? If you come across something that you think is offensive, ignore it. Others @ MONTH1 love it the way you love your favorite candy. We have a large number of other things for you to choose from

A curious child walks into the library for the first time to find a story to read. However, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library because it is said to promote certain ideals among children. The child will ask his older sister for help in finding another book. The older sister is too busy looking for her own book. She had entered the library looking for answers to his questions on a liberal subject. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it. Why censor libraries if we have freedom of the press and freedom of speech? It is not fair to censor libraries as it restricts what is allowed to be read, which takes away some of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will this be the next thing that gets censored? A book is like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the public who read it. By censoring librarians, it takes away freedom of expression. Writing is a way of expressing yourself. The writers share expressions there through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some help. Whether the book helps its reader escape a horrible day or answer a curious teenager's questions. I use books daily to escape the stress of life, the series '@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2' gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and my mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind. Some @ MONTH1 say offensive things should be censored. In our culture, even the smallest thing can be called " offensive " now. If we never learn these “ offensive ” things , how would we understand history ? There will always be some rude things that have been said, but we need to be exposed to them so that we can learn from them. By censoring these articles, we will never learn, and neither will our children, other cultures, history or liberal ideas. Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and marked in red. If some items become restricted ; this would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this, a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to and learn from different ideas. If there was a system for reporting an item, it would let the reader know that that item contains what might be considered offensive material so that they don't have to expose themselves to it if they wanted to. not, but others could. This would work because the books could stay in the library and still be in use, but there would be a warning system for those who don't want to be nearby or allow their children to be nearby. In conclusion, censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and of expression. We also make ourselves ignorant in this way. If we put in place a warning system, it will be fair to everyone. “ Offensive ” material can stay in libraries, but people will know in advance what they are exposed to and what their children are up against.

I don't think any source of knowledge should be taken off a shelf in a library because a few people think it's offensive. In my opinion, someone might find a book offensive and another person might think it is reasonable. People can't be judgmental to say it's offensive to me, so it's offensive to everyone who reads it. Some of the best books on our shevles are the ones that @ MONTH1 is offensive to. Some books are racist; From @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 for example has some racist and sexist comments and remarks. If everyone got mad about it, a really good book wouldn't be read by the people who run the country when I get older. I know that all older books would be looked at and then no one would know what happened in @ NUM1. Plus some of the @ ORGANIZATION1 shows people watch are ten times worse than the books people read, if you find a book offensive, don't read it ! When I hear that a book is offensive, it makes me want to read it. This gives character to the book and makes it humorous. We can't just have the same old books that talk about the same old things because it gets boring after a while. Sometimes from thought books you even learn something about yourself that makes you wonder if I hadn't read this book, would I have discovered this anyway. Sometimes that brings out the best in people and that's the best part about reading a book like this. Libraries are a place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading and no one should be able to take them away from people. I want my kids to be able to have the same options that I had growing up, plus all the new books that come out. If you ask me, it just isn't fair to take away someone's choice of knowledge. This is my personal opinion on removing books from public library shelves.

I believe things shouldn't be taken off the shelves because a few people are offended. There are a few @ MONTH1 who don't like something, but for all those who don't like it, there are some who like it. For example, there might be a book that makes women stupid but personally that doesn't affect me, but there are girls who take offense because of their superior knowledge. I have a friend who takes offense at movies where the black guy is always in trouble or dies first. So if we deleted every movie that offended her, what would be left. I take offense when a magazine shows that girls are pretty because it makes people feel insecure. Even though I feel offended, I'm not going to ask them to remove it because there are magazines out there that give advice and help people feel better about themselves and if I took that away from them it might cause some problems. If there is something being pulled from the shelves, there should be a good reason. As if there was a magazine that showed nudity, I would understand if they took it off so a child wouldn't see it. Some libraries remove things that could potentially cause a big problem. Maybe a newspaper is talking about a big disaster and everyone is swarming the booth attacking each other. Something like that can cause people to be hospitalized and then the library will be sued. Yes, I agree that there are people out there who would ask for things to be deleted, but you can't always get what you want. I know people would say it's not fair, but there is a saying that goes "life is not fair" and it is true. So the next time you hear someone wanting something taken out, big here or the next time you want something taken out, you refer to it. So, in conclusion, things should not be deleted unless it is necessary. So when someone is offended, that's their problem. You can always walk away without having to look or listen.

I believe that some materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. they're here for a reason. People love them. Maybe there are books and things that people @ MONTH1 or @ MONTH1 don't find offensive. It's ok, I'm not trying to say no, but you don't have to look at this book. There are so many more to choose from that it doesn't have to be the first one you choose. The objects we are talking about are our entertainment, they bring us joy and many smiles. People need to understand that children are going to have to receive their education not only from their teachers, but also from these tools. Tools is a better word for these things. It gives them meaning. Children now love books, music, movies, magazines, etc. As a teenager I can say that most of us who love music, we love it. It builds our character. People don't make books and magazines just to sit on a shelf and pick up dust. They had to be picked up and watched. I must also say that some people are making a big deal out of a topic like this. Don't get me wrong, I can understand their opinions stick, but that doesn't mean I have to agree. The children, @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 all have to learn in one way or another. Some of these ways are what some people are trying to get out of our libraries and other places as well. If the people want it will be a big war. Only because they are not the only ones on the planet. People want our tools removed, this will only be the beginning. In a few years, people will want to get rid of something else, something else. It's just one after the other, it won't stop. It just shows how our communities agree and disagree with each other. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, some are good and some are bad. In this case, in my opinion, I totally and completely disagree with the idea of getting rid of the tools that can improve our world as we know it.

Do I think that some documents, such as books, music, movies and magazines should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive ? No, I don't agree at all. D @ CAPS1 you know there is more than @ CAPS5 radio? Well @ CAPS3 you do. Not only should person @ CAPS5 be able to speak for everyone. I like all kinds of music and books. @ CAPS4 is pretty much my life. All I know is when I'm offended by a song I change @ CAPS4. When I read a book that I don't like, I ask @ CAPS4. @ CAPS4 is not for you to make my decisions. I live my own life and I personally think you should live yours too. Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, everything like that is for our entertainment. If they started taking them off the shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have free speech? Offended people should put what @ CAPS4 is down and move on. Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things people use for entertainment doesn't mean they should be removed. Writers and directors spend months, if not years, making movies and writing books just to keep us entertained and feeling fulfilled. If they started removing them from our shelves and big screens, people would lose their jobs. For example, look at @ PERSON2 @ ORGANIZATION1. It can easily offend a person, but it's brilliant jobs. Personally, I'm the kind of person who reads suspenseful books, books that keep me going. People like books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are “ offensive ”. I myself read a book that was about drugs and violence I relate with and @ CAPS4 helped me, @ CAPS4 made me realize that it was not always the right thing to do. I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and everything else that "offends" them is reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw away or what you keep at home, your kids, parents, friends, everyone will see @ CAPS4 someday in their life. Violence and drugs are seen every day. Lots of other things that offend people will still be there. If all of these things are offensive to some people, they need to be faced with reality. Books like this can inspire children to want to go in the right direction. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and they'll think, '@ CAPS2, I never go.' @ CAPS3 I can't say this goes for all the kids in this world, but you know what I'm trying to say. If @ CAPS4 are the parents who are worried that their kids will get into this stuff, be my guest to remove @ CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from people who like @ CAPS4. I firmly believe that people distinguish right from wrong, so why not just grow up a bit and do the right thing? I like those offensive books, movies and magazines. It reminds me of the drama. People say they hate @ CAPS4, but regardless, @ CAPS4 is everywhere, and @ CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't go through life being offended every @ CAPS3 and then how do you think you're going to survive. What do you think of the reserve for the years to come? You must learn how to manage @ CAPS4. To remove all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against @ CAPS4, they should be worried about themselves and leave @ CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and @ PERSON1 reserves when there is an @ ORGANIZATION1 within their reach. This is literature, writing. Do you honestly think the author was afraid of offending anyone ? No, because the writer or director who wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what it was about and they know not everyone will see @ CAPS4. Not everyone will want to see @ CAPS4. They know people are smart enough to read the summary before they get “ offended ”. @ CAPS4 irritates me when people think they have to live for everyone. @ CAPS4 is like the saying goes, 'Man's trash @ CAPS5 is another man's treasure.' You might not like @ CAPS4, you might even hate @ CAPS4. But once @ CAPS4 is out of your hands, the next person might come back and fall radically in love with @ CAPS4. I think just because someone takes a book and @ CAPS4 offends them, @ CAPS4 doesn't mean they had to get off the shelves. Grow up, put on what @ CAPS4 is that offends you and go.

In this world, you never know what someone might write. There is a lot of material in this world which I think is not appropriate for someone to read, watch or listen to etc. You @ MONTH1 think that anyone decides for themselves what they read, watch, listen to. Well I am okay with that but I think there are some materials that are not rated properly for their age. I think some materials should be prohibited for minors, some for children, and some for everyone. You @ MONTH1 think this is all wrong and that there is nothing wrong with books, music, movies etc., but in my opinion some material is just offensive and inappropriate. I have seen so many documents that I think they are not suitable for minors. In some movies, for example, the rating is just not correct because some movies have so much violence or language. You might not think this is a big deal, sure, but I do. In my opinion, there are some materials that aren't too badly rated and shouldn't be aimed at minors. It is not surprising to me that children are now screaming, hitting and / or acting rebellious towards their parents. Lots of those things kids get from books, music, movies, etc. This is most of the reasons why certain materials should be prohibited for children. You wonder why ? Well, first of all, kids are just learning and they do whatever they watch, see or listen to. I mean now the kids don't even think about what they're about to do. They just do it, they don't care, they think it's okay. I think parents should be aware of offensive materials on the shelves and should say something about it in order to ban them. Why ban certain materials from everyone? Well, first of all, why do we even want to watch, see, or listen to things that are wrong? You @ MONTH1 think we're doing this just for fun and it's nice and there's nothing wrong with it. Well you @ MONTH1 are right but also wrong. I certainly agree with you, we've all watched things for fun and for the sake of it, but some things are just too out of this world for us. Why are people doing crazy things now these days? In my opinion, I think it's because they mostly get it from books, music, movies, etc. I think if a book shows things that are very offensive, they should be off limits to everyone no matter what. That's what you should do. If you don't want to see this world get more out of hand than it already is. Well, we have to do something about all these offensive materials and ban them for good. We certainly don't want to see our children screaming, hitting, or acting rebellious towards us. We don't want a crazy person to come into our house and do crazy things to us just because that's what they learn from those documents that they had on the shelves. It occurred to me that certain materials should be prohibited for minors, children and others for everyone

A place of knowledge should be a place where you can find all the news that makes the world what it is today, a person should also be able to find out things from the past. A library contains many different things: books, magazines, movies, and some contain music. Books range from encyclopedia to @ PERSON1, the variety of books and information is extreme. But then again, with all the good stuff, there's always a bad side of information. With all the profanity found in society today, you wouldn't want a child to see or hear anything in a public library. The books are put in a library so that people have the chance to read them and become more informed. The idea that a younger person enters the older adult zone is very upsetting, but again, who can say that this person is not allowed to read an article or magazine with information or language? more mature. I think a person will see what they want to see and what they want to read, the point is they have the right to. Young people and old people need to be educated in the past history of the world and in the present day. One of the reasons is to prevent things that happened in the past from happening again. Another reason is just for them to know what is going on around them and for the individual to be informed. Libraries should have banners or flaps indicating what is in a certain section of that specific area and people can make the decision to go to that area or not. Things that aren't "right" to us @ MONTH1 don't seem so bad to others, it's all about personal preference. Things should always be read or seen by the public. Choosing to go to a library is an individual decision. The point is that the library is a place where a person should be able to acquire knowledge, regardless of the type of information. A person should be able to get their information without censorship from others.

I think your parents should have to sign a piece of paper saying it's ok or not ok for the person to go to this side of the library. It's up to the parents and how the kids will handle it. On the library side, it would be more aimed at a more mature audience, not porn material of course, but stuff that wouldn't be @ NUM1. Children fifteen and over would understand. They may also need to be accompanied by an adult. On the other side of the library, it would be more of a children's area with children's stories. It would be aimed at more children aged fourteen and under. There should be someone in the dividing line who is shown the pass who says it's ok or not. It would be a bit difficult but it would satisfy both parties. It is up to the parent to decide whether it is acceptable for their children to read certain language and description content. The child must be at least @ NUM2 in order to get a parent pass. I totally agree with Katherine Paterson, eventually your kids will find out what all of these things are. I would prefer my kids to learn from a book and then ask me to find it on the street where they might end up getting hurt or getting into trouble with the law. Or even go to a party and end up doing something that might kill them.

Do your rights end where mine begin? In such a diverse society, divergent views are inevitable. Does this mean that the rights of others should be violated because we do not agree with their practices, beliefs or way of life ? Everyone in this world is entitled to their own opinion. What is wrong with some people @ MONTH1 is right with others. For example, one @ MONTH1 family considers their children to use profanity as offensive while another @ MONTH1 sees no problem. The diversity of beliefs does not mean that it is acceptable to censor society against curses, religion or violence mentioned in published works. These concepts exist in the world and censoring them will not make them go away. It is understood that there is both bad and good in the world, and removing documents from library shelves will not change that. To censor books, magazines, music and other media is to deny someone the opportunity to see ideas from all points of view. Whether or not you prevent a young child from seeing all perspectives doesn't mean that there is no such thing as good and bad. The saying "a year older, a year older" can refer to the recognition of different ideas and opinions. As a child grows, he will learn more about censored material. In some cases, like in class, your rights end where mine begin. When it comes to discovering the beauty of diversity, everyone can choose what they choose from the shelf. The definition of “ offensive material ” is simply a matter of opinion.

Do I think some materials like books, movies, magazines etc. should be taken off the shelves.? No, I don't think some of this material should be deleted. Why? because kids these days read things like gang violence and things that don't involve school materials, but some kids find the books they read interesting. Now, do I think books shouldn't be given to students who are very young? Yes, because some books are a little older than others. Sometimes you @ MONTH1 have kids who are interested in what other people don't read. Books such as gang violence and drug addiction are a few of those books in categories that some cannot read. I think in this case children under a certain age should not read these books because of the content involved in them. Children find these books, films and magazines interesting because a lot of things that are happening in the world today are happening inside of these books. I'm not saying it's a good thing, but I'm saying the things that they read and see in these books and movies are things that some of us have seen in everyday life. When I was younger I would go to a library at @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS1 and whenever a kid chose a big one that wasn't for him, he would always say " you need your parents' permission. to consult this book or magazine, etc. ". outside'. Once I noticed and understood why they would do this, I thought it was a good idea. I think all libraries should be like this since children shouldn't read books that are not suitable for them. It is also a good way to get kids to read things that are not suitable for their age to find something that is. So the main answer to this suggestion is no, I don't think these materials should be moved from shelves outside of libraries. Why? because once they are gone, some children might not even go to the library anymore because the books they find interesting have disappeared. So my suggestion is not to move them around and let them stay on the shelves like any other book would.

Do you think there are any books, movies, or magazines that should be taken off the shelves of a library due to censorship ? Often times you will hear a parent telling their child not to watch this magazine because they don't want them to see vulgar things inside. I've heard parents tell their kids to never watch this movie because it will show things they don't need to see. Almost every day we are placed in situations like these, not knowing whether to take the magazine or just leave it on the shelf. In my opinion, I think libraries should remove anything vulgar from the shelves. Children are encouraged to go to the library as much as possible, but not if there are vulgar things on the shelves. Children are told several times a week by their parents, teachers and other adults to go to the library. They can do homework, read a book, or study for school. When they're distracted from finding the book they want along with a book that contains vulgar stuff, they're going to be curious. The main reason I don't agree with having vulgar things on the shelves is because of young children. The last thing they need to look at is something that is not appropriate for their age. It is difficult for a child to refuse a movie or a magazine that he has never seen or watched before. In most libraries, the section for adults is separate from the section for children. This is not to say that a child cannot overhear something that adults listen to or watch. The kids 'section is designed for fairy tales and kids' movies, but when the adult section has things that aren't the most appropriate, kids can hear. If kids and adults are going to be in the same library, I think it should be completely impossible for kids to go around there and see what's new on that side of the library. Another reason I think libraries should censor themselves more is because of the teens in the community. After school hours, many teens in our community enjoy going to the library. If it's such a good environment for teenagers, why are they able to download bad music from the internet? Some teens listen to bad music with swear words, vulgar language, and more. Libraries should stop teens from doing this. If they want to download bad music, they have to do it somewhere else where younger people can't find it. My final point on this is a warning to parents. Parents should check what their children are watching when they go to the library. You might not think that your child would look at something with vulgar things, but sometimes they are curious. All children are, and it's human nature to be curious. I myself would go with my child a few times just to see what was in the library and tell him not to remove things that look bad from the shelves. Some libraries cannot completely repair everything. They can't take all the bad or vulgar things off the shelves. In the quote it says, "We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelf.", I can think of books and magazines that I would never want a child to look at, especially at a young age. Libraries need to be more interested in removing vulgar items from shelves so that young children cannot get them. It's one thing for a child to see a book or magazine that isn't necessarily appropriate, but in a library that's a whole different story.

There are certain books that no child should ever read, but in some libraries they don't care what's on the shelves. They don't care if a little child starts reading a book full of profanity and other profanity. As long as he's reading, that's all that matters to them. Even though libraries have children's sections, that doesn't mean he can't step on it and grab a book @ CAPS1 or whatever he can get his hands on. When I was little I was always in the library and it was never difficult to get a book with bad language. We even thought it was funny when the book contained swear words because we were just rehearsing. I remember at school even the books the teacher read to us swore and we all laughed at it, even the teacher thought it was funny. But if we ever repeated that word without reading it, we would be sent to the office. Even though we thought it was okay to say it just because we read it in a book. I agree that books with foul language should never be on a shelf where a child can grab them. I think it's good to have swear words in the books when you're in middle school but elementary school is too early. These books are intended for adults only because some books sound better with swear words. My parents thought it was wrong when I brought home a book from the library and it was full of profanity or slang. But they would never say anything to the library because they know I'll hear those words all the time when I'm older. These are all the reasons why I think that books containing name-calling should not be distributed to small children.

Billions of books float from shelf to shelf every day: fiction and non-fiction, horror and comedy. Writers reside in all parts of the world and compose works ranging from complex life experiences to simple dreams. As an author, who has the right to freedom of expression, the storylines become endless combinations. Each reader is looking for a different style. Libraries contain books that rise to the ceiling, of all kinds, of all kinds. The books are divided into individual sections according to truth, type, and cover, with each category containing approximately four options. The need for censorship should never be an option. Writers compose for all kinds of people. For some, saying what is “ true ” or “ false ” is not a legitimate reason for a work to be taken off the shelf. If, perhaps, more books had ratings like movies do, a booth @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 could be created instead of allowing young people access to such vulgarity. Taking away the pleasure of some readers, however, is unethical. Whether it's books, music, magazines, etc., censorship is unnecessary. Those who compose the entertainment should not have to worry about the content of their expression and / or performance. If the concern is with young people, parental guidance should be in effect. Cancellation can affect those who relate to the source, so it's important to consider all options. To each his own.

Censorship, or the ability to control what is seen or heard, is a term that is taken very differently from person to person. Music, if deemed offensive or inappropriate, may be consored or even banned from listening. Some magazines that can be found in grocery stores, libraries, and sometimes even airports, have @ ORGANIZATION1 covers on the front to visually censor the front page of the magazine. Movies are categorized according to their level of explicit content, and when broadcast over basic cable, they may sometimes contain silenced words or more appropriate words to fit the dialogue of the movie. Books, although very rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored around the world. Some books have already been censored, but have become uncensored and brought back to libraries. In my opinion, censorship should not be based on a single person's point of view on the material, but rather on the point of view of the public. Growing up, my parents carefully monitored the shows I watched, the music I listened to, or the types of magazines I watched. When I was young I loved watching professional wrestling. I loved watching big, scary guys as tall as seven feet banging each other with steel chairs, crashing into tables, or throwing each other out of twenty foot steel cages. My brother and I had a favorite wrestler for each week, @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1 could carry any other wrestler in his way. My brother and I loved watching @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1 compete each week for a chance to win a world champion belt. Over time, professional wrestling began to welcome beautiful women into their business. These women stepped into the ring in tight, shiny lingerie as they became a treat for men watching pro wrestling. One day, I watch two girls fight in a game when my mom walks in. She takes a look at the half-naked girls fighting and turns the @ CAPS3 off and says pro wrestling is too adult for me. Even though I was twelve at the time, I didn't want to argue with my mom about what I should be allowed to see. Censorship can be based on the ideas and views of parents and guardians. I was in elementary school when I fell in love with the show '@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6.' @ CAPS7 is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5. These four boys, who are all around eleven, use swear words that some adults are afraid to use in everyday life. Their behavior is very controversial and the series itself has been forced to ban some of their episodes for security reasons. One problem with the @ CAPS7 show was that my dad also liked the @ CAPS7 show and was trying to get my mom to like the show. When my mom saw the show, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content. Now that I'm older I'm able to make my own decisions about what to watch, but when I was a kid my parents decided what was right for me. I grew up listening to many types of music. My brother listened to rap, alternative and even songs that were in musicals because he was in a choir. My dad introduced me to classic rock and my mom loved soft rock. Even though I didn't necessarily like the music my mom liked, I learned to like my dad's music and my brother's music. I loved listening to music from artists like @ ORGANIZATION4, @ ORGANIZATION1, @ LOCATION1, @ ORGANIZATION3, @ CAPS8, @ CAPS9, etc. My musical tastes have diversified into a variety of different genres. One day, I am walking in the hallway when I hear music coming from the living room. I'm going to see what plays out because it doesn't sound familiar to me. My father and brother told me to go to another room and not listen to the music. The song was by a band named @ ORGANIZATION2. Even though it may seem unfair, censorship, given by parents and guardians, is very necessary. While some people may find a certain piece of material offensive, that doesn't mean the entire world should be banned from the material itself. If that person wants to stay away from the material and prevent their children from seeing or listening to the material, they can do it. Censorship, given by parents or guardians, is the best way to view censorship. Nothing should be prohibited in a library, music store, or any other place that sells this material. Censorship is important, but banning certain material altogether is unfair.

Yes, there are a lot of things today that are censored, but they should be kept out of our libraries. I think not. They should not be taken out of libraries for censorship. Maybe if they're such a big concern, they could do something else with them besides getting them out. I don't think they shouldn't take censorship articles out of libraries just because some people have a problem with it. games, @ CAPS1, etc. I think if they even consider removing the product from the library, it should be the library's responsibility, not the government. If censorship is such a big deal with people, they don't have to check it out or watch it. So maybe if they have problems with the parents because the kids check that he censored the articles, they should have a group. Like if you want to release an article with censorship you have to either be @ NUM1 or have a parent or guardian with you. But if there is still a problem with that do like tobacco products where you need to be. @ NUM1. Then if libraries don't want to do that, they could create an entire room just for the censored articles. They should also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library. There should also be a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and, maybe a sign saying @ NUM1 and up. So there are plenty more to deal with the censored stuff. If there are so many, it is to treat them, why remove them. We shouldn't have to remove the elements of censorship just because some people don't like it. Why punish everyone because of a few people

What would you do if a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantrum over the inappropriateness of a book and wanted it taken off the shelves ? Would you just look at her and wonder if she was crazy? Do you think this is a public place and that everyone has their own opinions? I believe that even if someone thinks material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off the shelves. Many people actually think that the materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate. Unsurprisingly, there isn't much libraries can do about this except take them off the shelves if absolutely necessary. However, come to think of it, if everyone complained that a certain book was offensive, there would ultimately be no more books! For example, I wouldn't want my little brother to read @ PERSON1 books because some @ MONTH1 chapters contain a sex scene. However, my brother will eventually be older, and he will be able to understand. If I had gotten rid of this book, I wouldn't let others appreciate it. If you had to remove books that pertained to @ CAPS1 because you were @ CAPS2, a lot of @ CAPS3 wouldn't be happy to say the least. However, it can be about any topic. The more books that are taken out of the library, the less people will know about the subject. Finally, as I said before, there will be no more books! Everyone has their own opinion on what is and is not appropriate, and everyone's views are different. The solution to this problem is simply not to remove the books. Of course, you could receive complaints. But chances are, more people are not offended rather than offended. Americans have a right to fight for it, but since the majority are not offended, it is a tough deal to win. I believe all books would be well left on the shelves. If you take out a book, you might as well take out the rest. The next time you pick a book and find it offensive, think about how others might want to read it. They might even need the information for an article they are writing for a class. You never know who might need the information. Don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf.

Tuff @ CAPS1 for a little @ CAPS2 Censorship is a problem we face today. I believe there are some cases where censorship is necessary, but I also think it needs to be controlled. This is why I have a great deal of respect for organizations and industries that try to stop or put censorship in the media until you are mature and responsible enough to handle it. The most common categories where censorship isn't good in my world are books and music. Many of the books are very well written and fabulous to read, but in history or racial and more cultural books they use words / terms that are offensive to me and many others. Also, the main cause is music. In today's society, almost every person has an iPod and downloaded to this iPod is music. I'm not saying all music is terribly bad, but in most cases I hear about every word of the book and racing topics. Rappers set bad examples for young teens like me who pose with guns and have marijuana and crack. Why are they doing this? Just to make themselves more popular. It damages our education and makes us think we should be criminals. In my opinion, I appreciate magazines and insightful facts from professional journalists. Journalists are on the side of the citizens and try to get the real facts out for us the people. The magazines also tell about the annual celebrations and the good things that are happening in the world. Why you can find out the scores of sports matches and the weather. Last year I remember reading 'AT @ CAPS3 a @ CAPS4'. It was so contradictory and was about black and white slaves treating them like dirt. Also, black people never win a case and are treated unfairly. I felt embarrassed and I was the only African American in the class. It was embarrassing. I felt like if we had a chat people would talk badly about iot, then remember I was in the room, then stop. What is the world going to do? Censorship covers a whole multimedia spectrum of what is good and bad censorship. It is up to the right people to stand up for what is right and wrong for your children and young adolescents in the world. To help fight this cause! Shoot down all that is bad! We can do it, we will fight! As @ PERSON1 says, “ don't hope for a better change or want a new world ”. If you want to change you have to make it happen and stand up for what's right and make a difference in the world.

Some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. The material should be removed if they offend their genre. In addition, the material should be removed if it offends their religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offends their breed. Material should be removed if it is offensive to someone's gender. First, material can make a person unworthy. Second, the material can cause a great argument between the author and the person who is offended and perhaps others. Third, the material can also harm someone by picking up the book and reading the text. Additionally, material should be removed if it is offensive to someone's religion. This can cause someone to hate everyone else of the same religion as the writer, songwriter, actor and / or director. Second, the library should be devoted to education, entertainment and interesting content, without offending someone's religion. Finally, it can cause one or more people to act like terrorists from this offensive content. Material should also be removed if it offends someone's race. First, the @ MONTH1 material calls out the race of the person reading, listening or viewing a name that is a very offensive name (not directly but in general). Second, the hardware can talk about the race like it's bad. Finally, the material can influence other children to disrespect that race and dislike people of that race. Material that is offensive to anyone's gender, religion and / or race should be removed from the shelves of a library. the library is a place where everyone can read, listen or watch something of interest so as not to offend others in any way.

Often times we go to the library looking for a good book or magazine to read without really knowing what books are available. In order to find a book that interests you, you have to explore by picking up the book and looking at the cover and reading its background. Sometimes we come across an inappropriate book or magazine for children and we wonder why that book is still on the shelf for anyone to pick up. I believe that materials that are offensive to some people should be allowed in the public library. For starters, the books selected to advertise on library shelves are not limited to a certain age level. Libraries are divided into different sections for where to find a genre, but a young child @ MOIS1 doesn't. I believe these are some material found in a library that should not be made available to the public. Maybe you have a five year old who picks up a book on sex and drugs, it might lead the child to learn things that he shouldn't know until he's older. To continue, offensive books should not be put in libraries as they give that library a bad reputation. If someone came from out of town and the first thing they saw on the shelves of a library was a book with a naked body or drugs, they would immediately be taken back. Offensive types of books can include books you wouldn't want a first-grader to see, as well as books about race or religion. Some people would take offense to a book that went against what they believed in. It could lead to a huge showdown. Finally, offensive books can include books about someone's opinion on a certain topic. If someone against the writer's opinion started reading the book, they would automatically be offended by what the writer said. There is never agreement when two people have different views on something. In conclusion, although some books are offensive to some people and not to others, we should be aware that @ MONTH1 causes problems for some people. I believe that any open book on opinion, and books that would be "X rated" should not be kept in a public library. We could easily solve this problem by creating a separate place to store these books so that people don't mind.

What do you think about their taking books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive ? Everyone has a different take on it. This is an important thing to think about. Stop and think you want your kid to watch this when you're not around? Many would say no, because they are too young to know things that show a lot and other reasons as well. Removing anything found offensive from the shelves would be the best idea for young teens and children. I believe they should be taken off the shelves, and you must be @ NUM1 or higher to purchase them for a number of reasons. The main reason I think they should be doing this is because kids under @ NUM1 want to look cool like older teens, but really don't need to see it. With the young teenager they think they have to do things like music, movies, to be cool and think if they do they @ MOIS1 look cool. Young teens don't think about what they're doing, and just think it's okay because older teens do and they see it. With magazines, movies, and music, they have to be of legal age to buy. One of the main reasons for believing they should take off the shelves is that many children and young teens think they can go anywhere and look at things that are deemed offensive. There are many different types, and some places need to be of legal age. Thinking that they should take them off the shelves, it gives the @ CAPS1 a chance to freely fill your child up to look at things without thinking about it. the offensives. I hope that by reading my persuasive essay, I hope I identify with someone about books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive. with you and they see something like that. With the stuff I gave you, it helps you see what's offensive on the shelves

Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should they be removed from libraries if they are found to be offensive ? My opinion on this is no. In this essay, I will explain my opinion and hopefully change the opinions of others. I will also explain how the past affects the present. In some cases, books, music, movies, magazines, etc. @ MONTH1 offend any race or gender, but that's what happened in the history of @ LOCATION1. Some @ MONTH1 are very offensive but only show a past, others @ MONTH1 are just racist or sexist. Those who show the story of @ LOCATION1 @ LOCATION1 are a source of education so that we can learn from our mistakes. Here is exactly why I express this opinion, taking this material off the shelves is like depriving someone of their freedom of speech. I hate when I'm here music that disrespects women, but I'm not going to try to take it away as it might just express how much the artist of the song liked someone or how much the family history @ MOIS1 was. In conclusion, I think this material should not be taken off the shelves. After explaining my opinion, think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory. If a past was offensive something might be offensive, as I was told earlier in my life, treat others as you would like to be treated. Hope I got some attention and changed some opinions because a lot of offenses today are the result of the past

Censorship in libraries? A yes or a no? I believe there should be no censorship in libraries. There aren't many "offensive" or "harmful" things in most of the libraries in @ LOCATION1. I don't see who would come up with such an absurd idea. For me, there are many ways for people to be offended. @ MONTH1 Remind you that we almost changed our commitment to our country's flag by getting rid of the word "god" because some people don't believe in god. Now, are we supposed to get rid of the good books just because they're kid-friendly ?! Think of all the amazing books, movies, and magazines that should be taken out of our libraries just because someone says, “I find this book offensive” or says, “I don't think this book is suitable for my child. @ CAPS1 about the people who love this book and will not be able to read it because of this one person ? There are sections in libraries for a reason! Just put the naughty books in the eighteen or over section so the younger ones don't see them. People who want to get rid of supposedly dangerous books for children make libraries look like pornographic stores. Most libraries are not filled with horrible bad books that will make the child mentally afraid forever. Hell, there really are those kinds of books out there anyway. Now sometimes a bad @ MONTH1 book ends up in the kids section, but that doesn't mean we have to remove this book forever from everyone else who wants to read this book. All library workers just need to make sure they put all the books in the right places and nothing bad will happen. Bad books will be in the adult section and children's books will be in another. Have libabria employees monitor the area and keep small children out of libabria. This will prevent kids from seeing the wrong books as they will be in the adult section. In conclusion, I answer this question by saying no. There are just a lot of good books that should be gone forever

I believe that any literature, whatever it is, is useful even though it may be offensive. If the company is considering taking something off the shelves because it offends a race or gender, then many life lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be taken off the shelves. Things like books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world @ MONTH1 doesn't teach them. If documents are taken off the shelves for fear of offending someone, then there won't be much left, as Katherine Paterson says in her quote. If the true literature no longer existed, it would certainly not be the same as it is today. The literature is there for us, they teach us, and if an @ CAPS1 were to be removed it would start a riot. Books are always there for us, when we are bored, alone or just want to escape reality. Imagine if you couldn't read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for the company. If all books were to be suitable for all ages, that would eliminate all the interesting from everything. Whether it is a novel or an ordinary encyclopedia, all books would be blunted to exceed the needs of our " non-offending " society . A lot of music would lose its shine and magazines would not be able to chat about "hottest new things". Movies would become too boring to watch and a lot of things in society would fall apart. Books, documentaries, magazines are there to help people learn, whether it is a lesson on what not to do in your youth, like smoking, if books on smoking have been taken down because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke, so how would one of today's teenagers know not to start smoking ? Novels are generally fiction, but the characters come to life for readers. They have issues just in the lives of people in the real world even though they @ MONTH1 aren't real themselves, so if one reads this book, the way this character handles the situation might help someone in the world. real life deciding what to do about her problem. Important film history books could be taken away as it “offends” @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 to have students learn more about slaves. If an @ CAPS1 was taken off the shelf for offending someone, more and more documents would be removed from the company. What is it for someone? This leaves many students without education on many things that they need to be educated about. It would disrupt library order if books were removed for relevance. If books were judged on relevance, then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they are doing now. It would not be good to take anything off the shelves of libraries. Books, movies, magazines, music, it's too important for society, it keeps us company, it teaches us, it makes our life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you're down. If a person decides that a book is not appropriate, they can choose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from library shelves. They would trigger a series of issues that would affect everyone at @ LOCATION1 and possibly even across the world. Information of any kind is a good @ CAPS1 regardless of its content. So removing all kinds of material from our libraries is a horrible idea.

The content of today's materials is not always subtle for young children. Information now disseminated in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or surround, including video games. Growing up in a violent environment, children observe and are more likely to become violent. The continuation of censorship in today's materials is a necessity for the well-being of children in today's society. In video games, there are ratings that help explain what is subtle for each age throughout childhood and adolescence. The movies are also the same, making it more difficult for young children to see some movies. Books and magazines are not as well protected as they should be. Age and maturity play an important role in whether or not a child should read aloud and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a major trend in video games in today's world, and some of the influence it exerts on children is unnecessary and possibly detrimental to their well-being. The reason the ratings need to be changed is that children absorb their surroundings and become what they see, so if they are introduced to violent behavior they are more likely to become violent children. In libraries, there are sections for each age group, specific genre of books, fiction and non-fiction. But some explicit items in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and made available to young adolescents and children. As part of the community, libraries should look after the well-being of children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary. Throughout my own experience, I have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge. Especially in music today, the radios do a good job of editing the content of the songs, putting parental notices on some CDs, but that still doesn't stop them from buying the material. In games like @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2, @ NUM1, etc., teens are now getting used to this type of behavior, which is neither safe nor conducive for children. By censoring certain content, it prohibits the persistence of bad behavior among our young people today

READ WITH @ CAPS1 I don't believe libraries bear the responsibility of censoring reading materials. When a person walks into a library, they should immediately infer that, because libraries are places in which knowledge is accumulated, that part of this information that they find @ MONTH1 does not coincide with what she thinks. If a person thinks a book is offensive, they may as well drop it as they took it. Obviously, however, there are some exceptions. Children's sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for young readers. Putting '@ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3' in a children's section doesn't make much sense. just as much as putting '@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5' in the adults section. Additionally, author @ PERSON1 once said that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right should be granted to all other users as well. Thus, not all books in a library can be read. the knowledge they contain is unknown. As with any prescription, there are exceptions. For example, if a library is intended only for the use of a younger audience, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. Excluding inappropriate material, such as permissive reading, prevents children from formulating ideas about concepts that @ MONS1 are not able to fully understand. With all of these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems like the best solution. A library should be a place of enlightenment. Opposing ideas must be presented. Let readers make their own decisions about what they believe. Because books are like atoms. When two opposing types collide, an explosion of energy is released.

A @ CAPS1 is a place where people of all ages can pick up books, magazines, music, movies and more. Libraries are essential for learning and supporting people with reading skills. Studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and understand well. However, in my opinion, reading, watching or listening to offensive material has no place in libraries to some extent. As I said earlier, libraries are a place of learning and skills development. Books intended for " adults " can be found in adult stores or even at a regular local bookstore. Parents bring their children to @ CAPS1 to support and advance their reading ability. They don't want to have to worry about making sure their kids don't see anything wrong. A few years ago, I met a teenage boy who went to @ CAPS1 about once a week to look for movies that his parents wouldn't approve of. Later this boy was caught and punished. If this kind of movie didn't exist in the first place, his parents wouldn't have had to worry about them. Almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has a bad background. Parents should feel good and carefree when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to @ CAPS1. This problem can be easily resolved by removing this problem. I strongly believe that @ CAPS1 material should be censored so that those who shouldn't see it can't see it. On the other hand, material such as religious or cultural learning objects that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Religious and cultural books, music, films and / or magazines are there for those who want to learn. From what I've seen, someone @ MONTH1 wants, for example, a book on @ CAPS2 off the shelves because they are @ CAPS3 and might not support their religious ways. I find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and we cannot refuse them to inform others about this religion. Libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed. Everyone loves to sit in the @ CAPS1 for hours and soak up a good novel. The material deemed offensive does not belong to them, unless it is a real pedagogical learning.

The subject of censorship in libraries was brought up on several occasions. Censorship is a rule against viewing a book, music, movies, magazines, etc. This censorship is due to its rating or content that is inappropriate for some viewers / readers. Of course, a lot of people have their own opinions on this censorship in libraries, just like me . I think censorship is a good idea in some cases. These cases being music or movies. However, I don't think censorship is a good idea in the books. Children all over the world read books and over time our children are getting more and more advanced and reading at higher levels. This is where censorship comes in. Libraries want to censor higher reading level books because these books include profanity, violence, sex, drugs, and any other aspect of adultery. I don't agree with censoring these books because it basically tells our children that they can't question themselves or that they can't learn certain things because of their age. These books, in my opinion, can only help them. These books will help them learn about society, what is wrong and what is right, and will help them grow as they age. Higher reading level books help them understand words better and also help them learn about literature and times past. When I was in college I was by no means an advanced reader, but enjoyed reading every now and then. One day I went to the library looking for a stimulating book. The book I found was a book titled '@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2' by @ PERSON1. This book was a fictional story set during @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS3. When I entered my PIN code to view the book at reception, the librarian informed me that I could not view the book because it was a young adult book which means " too advanced " for me. She said I needed parental consent before I could verify it. That night I asked my parents about it and asked them if I could read it. They said yes, mainly because they were so thrilled that I even wanted to read such a stimulating book. The next day, I received a note from home informing the librarian that I could read the book. I was so thrilled when I finally got to discover and read the book. From my experience with library censorship, I think the best way to go is if there is a parent / guardian who has more than @ NUM1, and they approve the removal of the book / magazine or anything @ MONTH1, then the child or student is allowed to view said book / magazine etc. In conclusion, the censorship of books, magazines, etc. is an overall poor idea, with a few exceptions. The parent / guardian consent rule is the best way to go in my opinion. Of course, this topic will be debated for many years to come and many people will have their own opinion. Each side of the argument has valid points, but I think it's imperative that we avoid book censorship and that our children learn and read at their highest level, regardless of their reading level.

Should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive ? I don't think books or any other material should be taken off the shelves for some people? There are many reasons why books should stay on the shelves. I'll tell you all the reasons I think books should stay on the shelves. One of the reasons I think books should stay on the shelves is that some people might need them for a school project. For example, a student might have a project on @ CAPS1. A book on @ CAPS1 might offend a lot of people. Just because it offends some people doesn't mean it needs to be taken off the shelves because others might need this book. Someone may need a certain book for a project. If the book they need is taken off a shelf because it offended someone, they might fail a course. That's one of the reasons I think books should stay on the shelves. Another reason I think they should stay on the shelves is their opinion if the book offends them. Just because they don't like the book and it offends them doesn't mean that other people don't want to read it. Why would you want to remove a book from a shelf because it offends one or more people ? There could be a lot more people who want to check out this book and read it. If a book offends you, don't look at it. Why would you want to watch something that offends you? I don't understand why libraries should take a book off the shelves just because it offends someone. Especially when that person could just ignore the book and not pay attention. This is my last reason, my opinion is what it is. So after reading this I hope you understand why my opinion is what it is. There is no point in removing books from the shelves. People need it for research and projects. This is someone's opinion if he doesn't like the subject of the book and if it offends him. For example, if I didn't like something on a menu in a restaurant, they won't remove it from the menu for me. My last reason why books should stay on the shelves is that people can just ignore the books and not look at them which would be easier than taking the books off the shelves. THE @ CAPS3

@ CAPS1 right ? Does @ CAPS1 have the right to have censorship in libraries ? This question could be answered by two very different opinions. Some people @ MONTH1 want all elements of censorship not to be in public spaces. On the other hand, there are people who @ MONTH1 like to read this type of material. It is a very stubborn subject. In my opinion, libraries are the places I go to find a book to read, do research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while watching a magazine. Libraries are public spaces and not everyone will agree. Everyone has their favorite book or genre. I think @ CAPS1 is unfair in removing censorship from libraries because this @ MONTH1 is their favorite genre. Why should libraries limit their choice when no one else is ? For example, many parents would like all clothing stores to ban holes in jeans because they are too revealing. The stores don't. They do not prohibit the holes in the jeans because many teenage girls like the holes in their jeans. American @ CAPS2 isn't going to wear capris just because I don't like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions. An excellent resolution to this disagreement is categorization. By grouping all the censored books, movies, magazines and music in one area, @ CAPS1 will reduce the arguments on this topic because all the people who love censorship in libraries will be together in their area. While people who don't want censorship in libraries don't need to be around @ CAPS1. This is a quick and easy solution. There is no reason to take away your favorite genre because someone doesn't like @ CAPS1. If this is true, our world will have nothing because not everyone likes a certain thing. For example, I don't like blue airmail shirts. Pink is my favorite. My friend @ CAPS3 loves blue shirts and hates pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we don't like. It's not beneficial for either of us because now the one we don't like is gotten, but so is the one we like. It does not make sense. There will be nothing left in the store. Pople in charge can easily sort the material in a store or library to tailor @ CAPS1 to the tastes of the community. Getting rid of the hardware is not the solution. Categorization is the solution that must be implemented immediately

In our society today, there is a tremendous amount of exposure to materials that many adults did not have as children. Young children today see drugs, alcohol, sex and teenage pregnancy as part of a normal child's daily life. Some TV shows, books, and even popular songs condone these behaviors that many @ CAPS1 object to. While @ MONTH1 libraries seem to be the most unusual place to access these materials, many young children may purchase books that are simply not suitable for their age. Censoring documents, such as books, movies, and music, that are deemed offensive or inappropriate is one way of teaching young children that there is more to life than what the media presents. A very important reason for allowing censorship of material in libraries is that you may not be sure what type of book you are viewing. Many children, and adults too, walk into the library and look among the books until they see a cover or title that catches their eye. While most books in a library are age appropriate, a child can still pick up a book that is not something they should be reading. There are massive amounts of influential material from the media and also from peers that a child is subjected to. Censorship in a library will make it a safer place for children to go and search for any book in the section that suits them and also allow @ CAPS1 not to have to worry about what their child has selected. As author Katherine Paterson so aptly put it, “We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children pulled off the shelves. @ CAPS1 should never have to worry about what their child can find in a public library. A second reason for allowing censorship in libraries is that video stores already have censorship in their stores, along with ratings on all of their movies and video games. Most video stores have a separate section for movies that are deemed to contain “adult content”. A minor may not walk into a movie store and go to the section for films only for adults or anyone over the age of eighteen. A minor cannot rent a movie rated @ CAPS2 without proving that they are seventeen, or if they have an adult to rent it for them. The same happens with video games, for example a video game with a rating of @ CAPS3, or mature, cannot be rented or purchased by anyone under the age of eighteen. Censorship @ CAPS5 should be applied to libraries. Having separate sections based on adult content allows movies and books to be placed in a separate location so that no child can rent something they don't intend to watch. or read. The @ CAPS5 censorship type also allows a parent to choose whether their child can see it. An example of @ CAPS5 would be for a sixteen year old boy. Although he cannot go and rent the movie rated @ CAPS2, if his @ CAPS1 deems it acceptable, they can rent it for him. @ CAPS5 gives the parent control over what their child sees, instead of the child having full control. @ CAPS5 The same type of censorship as video stores is an ideal way to place censorship in a library. Perhaps the most important reason for censorship in libraries is the early exposure of material to children. Many young children have watched TV shows or heard things on the news that make it acceptable in our society to drink at parties when you are underage, to use illegal drugs for the sake of feeling and feeling good. having sex at a very young age because that is what “everyone else does”. @ CAPS5 is a very risky path for the young children of our society to take. Allowing our culture to become @ CAPS5 can lead to various kinds of issues, as we have seen. Many young children, some of whom are only fourteen or fifteen, go to parties and drink. When it comes to returning home, they accompany their seventeen-year-old friend who has a license and who also drank at the party. Now let's hope that the story ends and all the kids make it home safely, but that's not how it works in many cases. There have been so many drunk driving accidents recently in our country with children who shouldn't even have been drinking. @ CAPS5 is linked to censorship because of the way these children have been coerced into drinking. Many adults in society blame peer pressure; but where do peers get the idea that @ CAPS5 is acceptable ? These ideas come from influences to which children in society are sensitive. Censorship in libraries is a way to restrict the ideas children are exposed to and hopefully enable them to lead safer, healthier lives. While there are many other factors in children's exposure to these materials, stopping exposure in libraries is one way to eradicate early exposure. Young children in today's society and culture are exposed to excessive amounts of inappropriate material. These three factors, the inability to know what you might be checking out in the library, the fact that video stores already have censorship, and unnecessary exposure to young children, all lead to the need for censorship in libraries. . Today's society is based on the freedom to allow whatever is acceptable to happen. While some @ MONTH1 view these books or movies as their own freedom of expression, the truth is that it harms society, hence the need for censorship in libraries and other places where children have access to materials. movies, books, magazines, music and videos games. Removing offensive books, magazines and films from library shelves across the country will lead to a safer culture for children to grow up to and a society where things like drugs, alcohol and sex are not tolerated. as often.

Library books offensive? Whether or not to remove a book is not up to us, the people, in our opinion. If anyone has a problem with the book ; next time do not understand. I know that we should not have the right to remove books from libraries. It is not for us to make that choice. I know people sometimes find something wrong or inappropriate in a library book, but if that doesn't suit you, don't read the rest or refer it to a friend. I've had problems with this before. I went to read a book and my mom said she didn't like the subject he was talking about: honestly, that's her opinion. A person should be entitled to his opinions, but it should not affect others. Someone @ MONTH1 really likes the book and someone else @ MONTH1 hates it, obviously these are people who like this type of book, so there is no very good reason to get rid of it. The only person who should have a say in disposing of a book should be the librarian. This person knows what is acceptable and what is not for the library. If that includes something graphic or racist, you can talk to them about it in a clam chat because they might be librarians, but they don't read all the books in the library. Some articles may be offensive to some but not to others. The library is there for knowledge and entertainment. We can have opinions on matters and discuss them appropriately without causing great hardship, as that could be one of the reasons things are where they are. You must leave the choice to the person who is educated in the subject / who is in charge of the library

To whomever @ MONTH1, censorship has been a problem in our society for centuries. This is not only unnecessary, but unconstitutional. As @ CAPS1 we have certain @ ORGANIZATION1 that we are backed up by documents that keep our company out of anarchy. If the right to choose which literature to read, watch or listen to is taken away, where will that put our country? Censorship should not be allowed in our country today. In @ CAPS2, @ CAPS3 and @ ORGANIZATION1, we are given some @ ORGANIZATION1. Some of these @ ORGANIZATION1, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, have already been restricted, which is “ wrong ” in the eyes of the government, but nonetheless it is happening. We @ MONTH1 did not "lose" these @ ORGANIZATION1, but they were definitely restricted. Why should the government be able to tell us what to read? If censorship is allowed, what will happen is frightening. If our government, which is supposed to be "for the people" tells us what to read and what not to read, what is going to stop them from telling us what to wear, drink, or even eat? Censorship in libraries is one of our biggest problems. There are countless examples of why censorship of written literature should not be allowed. For example, if a student writes a research paper on the effects of rape on a child, but the government views the rape as “ too explicit, ” what should that student do ? He or she should have the right to use the materials necessary to write a well-informed article. But by censoring our libraries and removing books, the government is hampering the education of young people in its country. Some @ CAPS4 classics are also the subject of speculation. @ PERSON2's @ CAPS5 has been known as a classic since its writing. It is used in classrooms all over the country for education. But recently the availability of the book has been called into question. Throughout the novel the 'n-word' is used, but never as an insult. During the period of his writing, this word was more common and had a much less severe meaning than in modern societies. But because time has changed its meaning, it is being withdrawn from libraries and study programs across the country. This is illegal censorship. One of the greatest books of our time, a classic from @ CAPS4, is being withdrawn from the lives of our young people because of "racy language". Censorship does not only take place in written literature. Movies and music are also under the scrutiny of censorship. Movies are rated for a reason, to give viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate. It helps parents to be able to self-censor their children. But it is not for the government to be able to choose what a specific child can see. It is a parents' right to be able to expose or not expose their child to whatever they see fit, not that of the legislators of our country. Music is one of the biggest parts of our society today. With the invention of iPods and @ NUM1 devices, music has become much more mainstream and portable. Censorship is more and more severe with the change of musical style. The styles of music of modern adolescents are very different from those of their grandparents. Almost nothing is considered unacceptable by many rappers today, as evidenced by their choice of lyrics. The music business takes a big hit at what has become the most popular. Along with the most common themes of sex, drugs and money, @ MONTH1 seems offensive to some citizens, but others @ MONTH1 ignore it as normal. So how can anyone say " No, @ MONTH1 is not listening to this " ? It shouldn't be allowed, yet it is. How can a person or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not? They can not. Censorship is morally wrong, as well as legally wrong. Taking media out of its citizens, such as books, movies and music, is unconstitutional. What would our ancestors think of what happened to censorship? Before taking that " unacceptable " book off the shelf, remember the @ ORGANIZATION1 of citizens of our great countries and the @ ORGANIZATION1 of individuals like you. Sincerely, @ PERSON1

It is an important question for debate whether or not certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. Although there are materials that @ MONTH1 harm me children, freedom of information is far more important than protection because censorship is unconstitutional, prevents readers from having an unbiased perspective, and in some cases hides material. pressing social issues that are deemed inappropriate by censors. The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 states that freedom of expression, religion and the press should not be denied or abridged. More generally, the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 grants freedom of expression. Censorship is indeed unconstitutional. It prevents freedom of expression. Students and academics cannot access all the information that should be available to them without censorship. While private companies and libraries may be allowed to censor because they have their own contracts that allow it, public libraries and schools do violate the constitution when they censor. Censorship prevents a full and complete perspective on an issue. Censors often ban certain books because of personal opinions about alleged “immorality”. @ CAPS5 clear and complete access to all information, how can we draw a valid conclusion about anything ? If, for example, one wants to learn the difference between an agnostic philosophy and a deistic philosophy, but does not have access to any agnostic books, which have been banned by intolerant religious fanatics, you cannot learn anything effectively. Every special interest group wants to ban a certain type of material. Author Katherine Paterson said, "If I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this work that I hate - then you have the exact same right and everyone else too." And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. @ CAPS6 it's true. If each interest group deems it appropriate to censor material that goes against their interests, there will be no more material. There will be no more knowledge. Without knowledge we, as the human race, are left in the dark. Many books are banned which deal with major social issues. @ CAPS7 @ NUM1 from @ PERSON3 addressed the growing problems of censorship and the dangers of technology. As the firefighter @ CAPS8 @ PERSON4 was burning books, ironically, the novel was censored. It is perhaps a ploy of the censors to defend their particular interest, that is to say the censorship. They feel powerful when they restrict the freedoms of others. A novel by @ PERSON2, @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10, has been banned. Besides the vulgar language in the book, @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 also denounced free will and portrayed the brutal US bombing of @ LOCATION1 in @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14 @ CAPS15. This book says a lot about human truth, yet it has been banned. How will society change if every time a revolutionary book is written it is banned? Censorship is a big deal. While there are many works that are meaninglessly violent, brutal, and cruel, no books or other material should be censored. Censorship in public libraries and schools is clearly unconstitutional. Censorship prevents people from seeing the full perspective, and censorship hinders societal change. Censorship must be denounced as a restriction on our intelligence and our freedom.

Children are our future because when I get old they'll be the ones to take care of me, so censorship is a big deal for me. This is a big deal not only because of how it will affect my kids, but also because it will affect me and what everyone will be able to read. I agree that censorship is an important issue, but to what extent should it be taken. People should have the right to read whatever they want. They should also be allowed to find it in their local public libraries. My take on censorship in public libraries is that most things should be allowed to stay on book shelves. I can understand censorship to some extent, but removing books from a public library makes it difficult to choose the limit. You don't want a book to be taken down just for having the wrong word in it. Just because some books are classics that everyone is familiar with, does that mean we shouldn't take that book out of a public library? I think some books should stay because adults don't want to read children's books, they probably want to read a more complex book. I think these are books that should be left out of the library. Extremely racist books are one example. These books should be kept away from children. This is necessary because young children might try to play things that they could hear or read because there are audiobooks and these would just make them say these things. It might get them in trouble for things they don't yet understand. There are alternative things you can do to keep these things out of the reach of children. There is already one that is used in public libraries and it separates adult books from children's books. You can also move these two sections to opposite sides of the bookcase. books that are more self-explanatory cold be put higher up as on an upper shelf. Most children could not reach as high as an adult. These are my views and ideas on censorship in libraries. The ideas and views I have are most likely different from those of most people. I thought they were good ideas though. Those such as the separate section for children and adults. I thought my best was to put the more self-explanatory books higher and move the sections further.

Books, music, movies and magazines are all a form of expression. We have the freedom to @ ORGANIZATION1 as we feel or think, but can this be graphic for some to read? I believe that censorship in libraries is necessary to protect the minds of children and of people who are easily swayed by the thoughts of others. Books are a major factor in expressing how one feels on a subject ranging from romance to horror. Many children enjoy reading books or comics that involve a lot of violence. Children's minds are like sponges, which means that they absorb everything they read and this has a great chance of influencing their functioning in daily activities. If you go to a music store, you will find many different types of music, from rap to blue grass. I noticed in my school that a particular type of music that stands out is rap and the favorite artist is @ ORGANIZATION2 @ PERSON1. @ ORGANIZATION2 @ PERSON1 is known for rapping about drugs, sex, money and violence. Many teens think that if their favorite artist can do it all, why can't they? I've only listened to a few songs from @ ORGANIZATION2 and in every song one of these four key topics comes up. Like @ ORGANIZATION2 @ PERSON1, the movie industry is starting to release more and more movies about drugs, sex, money and violence. Many students at my school talk about the latest comedy movies like '@ ORGANIZATION1', 'The @ CAPS1', '@ CAPS2' ect. and how they turned their lives into something like those movies when they go on break @ DATE1 or @ DATE2. Movies like these are fun to watch, but for someone who is easily influenced, they shouldn't be watching. Books, music, movies and magazines, they surround us with their stories and thoughts about another human being. We ourselves have the freedom and the right to @ ORGANIZATION1 but we also have the right to take it away if we think it endangers the minds of others. I think censoring in a library of certain things is a good option to clean up a mind poisoning mess

I think anything offensive should be taken off the shelves because it's inappropriate. Books don't have to be like that because they are meant to be fun for you and help you learn, yes you can have a little violence in an action / adventure book to get the vibe of the book. character, the setting of the story, and to understand it perhaps. Offensive books can sometimes be okay, so if you have a humor magazine or a book that pokes fun at something or someone, it can be taken in an offensive way, or just a joke, and in a non-offensive manner. For most people, they will want to get these kinds of books off the shelves. Books offensive to them, like parents or maybe even friends, they can teach a child badly, and that child @ MONTH1 is not learning the right way. Children when they are little their brains are like sponges, so they learn and remember things well at this age. A child who gets their hands on a book or learns something from a book like this will most likely remember it. I think these kinds of books should be taken off the shelves because kids don't need to read this stuff when it's already on TV and being talked about. They need educational books that can teach them and prepare them for their next higher grade levels, so that they can get a fresh start on new words or grammar.

I think they should be taken off the shelves if they are to be presented to young children. as if it were sex or violence, they should be taken off the shelves. they should only be out loud to put @ NUM1 stuff on the shelves. I think they shouldn't even make books or magazines like this unless they can hide them from people under @ NUM2. but people will do whatever they want. That's all I have to say. have a good day.

Katherine Paterson made a valid point when she said that some books are too shocking for some people to read, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be read. Every once in a while, throughout someone's life, we hear things that we don't like and don't want to disturb, but it's good that we do. Libraries should have the right to open all types of books on their shelves and not have them censored by the public, which is why. We, as members of @ CAPS1, have gone through difficult times. @ CAPS2, racism and extreme poverty or depression are just a few to remember. Having solved these problems, we always tend to repeat them for lack of knowledge. Slavery and @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 were some of @ CAPS1's lowest times and they were very horrible as well. Recalling these memories is difficult but something that needs to be done; if books were to be sanctioned, many young adults would go uneducated and could repeat such horrific deeds. Regarding movies, music and magazines, the same laws apply. While not the same, these posts are often written about current events or social aspects of life. Music is a form of expression and everyone has their own tastes. Not having to choose from a variety of styles is wrong and unfair. Music can not only be an expression of love or anger, but it can also teach a life lesson. Some artists enjoy singing or rapping during their lifetimes. It can educate others that if you do this then it is the result, good or bad. In a magazine, they tend to focus on more current topics such as politics, employment or the lifestyle of young adults. The films apply to the same rights and subjects. Everyone is equally important and if a group of citizens think it is not then who are they to make this appeal. What gives a group of people the right to say it's irrelevant and you shouldn't read it ? They don't have it. The constitution says you have freedom of speech and that means you can express it however you want. By censoring what people read, it kind of takes away that author's right to speak. Now this is unfair. Although Katherine Paterson has argued that some books are too shocking to read, she just isn't right. A library is supposed to be a place where people can find and read a book, music, movie, magazine of any kind . If the documents were censored, it would be unfair to anyone else who wishes to read it. The main thing is that you have free will and you have to choose the weather or not, you want to read something

There are things in the world that some people don't see. Things like @ CAPS1 movies, @ CAPS2 books, alcohol and @ CAPS2 music are not for children. Yes, people have rights, they can see what they want. If an @ CAPS4 wants to see a movie rated @ CAPS1 or have a beer, it is the parents' choice to let that @ CAPS4 see that movie and not the person who runs the store. If you haven't reached the age limit, a merchant should have the right to tell you, you can't go into the store or buy their product. Is it okay for a storekeeper to say no to your @ CAPS4 ? Some would say yes to that and some would say no. If your @ CAPS4 is trying to buy a movie with guns, blood and murders, and you don't want your @ CAPS4 to have that movie, you might be mad if a trader leaves your @ CAPS4 on to buy. On the other hand, you might be angry if this trader told your @ CAPS4 that he was not allowed to buy this movie. If the @ CAPS1 rated is maturity based, how does this storekeeper know how mature your @ CAPS4 really is ? Your @ CAPS4 might be the one who likes to copy the things they see on the movies, the storekeeper doesn't know if this is true or not. He doesn't know this @ CAPS4, he can't tell if he's mature enough to watch this movie with guns, blood and murder. How would this storekeeper feel if this @ CAPS4 watched this movie, he let the @ CAPS4 buy and the @ CAPS4 go out and kill someone, how would you feel if that happened ? It wouldn't happen if there was an age limit. If a group of @ NUM1 year olds who just got their license walk into a liquor store and try to buy beer, who's going to stop them from driving drunk if there is no age limit for drinking ? Lives are wasted when teens make choices like drinking and driving. When you're @ NUM2 you don't think about what's going to happen after you make a choice, you just think how fun it will be while you do. Most 12- @ NUM2 year olds are not mature enough to make decisions instantly. There, since there should be an age limit for some things, maybe not all things in the world, like the weather or not, your @ CAPS4 can buy a candy bar or a soda. But an age limit to buy a film classified @ CAPS1, alcohol, firearms, knives excl. What would the world be like if kids walked around with these things? With an age limit on some, there wouldn't be a problem with these things

Why are you going to the library? In the old days, libraries were where you went to study. They weren't computers, so you had to look for your work in an educational book in the library. Is that really what people are doing in libraries now, or are people there to watch vulgar books, magazines, and movies? A library is meant to be the place where you can go to work in peace and have a useful resource of educational books. But, now you can go to the library and be tempted to look at books that you shouldn't be looking at. Instead, you could be on the computer all the time playing some games. The possibilities are limitless. People could now go to the library and consult a magazine, movie, or book about: pornography, drugs, achlocol or worse. Is this really what you want your child to accidentally pick up from the library ? Personally, I myself saw a little boy pick up a porn magazine from the library, and his mom must have grabbed it real quick before he had a chance to look at the magazine. The library should not be used for this, and the enjoyment of young children accidentally looking at these materials should not occur in the library. Music that someone might listen to is also very bad, and your child might listen to it. What if they want to keep listening to it? Yes, the world has a huge impact on what is put in the library; because drugs, sex, scandals and achlocol seem to be what interests most teens at some point in their young lives. But a library is a community building and nothing prevents someone from coming in and easily getting these vulgar things. The thoughts of young people are completely influenced after watching, reading or listening to this. And, it must be controlled. Women and children may find all of this material offensive. These materials need to be censored more than they currently are. Libraries should be a safe place for people to go to study or buy a book, and not be tempted to look at something they shouldn't be looking at. Many people find this offensive. Yes, ultimately libraries are a great place, but people who don't use libraries for the right reasons explain why these materials should be censored in libraries.

A library card is something a child always looks forward to. It is the first piece of identification that many children have and are allowed to carry with them. The map opens up a whole new world of entertainment and stories that can take you anywhere you want to go. Once a child had a library card, they were allowed to browse any book they wanted from the vast selection of items in a library. But how do you stop a young child from reading a book, movie or magazine with inappropriate adult content ? A solution to this problem must be found so that people can be protected from material that they do not want to see in a book, movie or other source of entertainment. Libraries today normally have a children's section, where picture books and news litter the shelves. The rest of the building is a scattering of books and other material sorted only by author's name and genre. The only way to figure out what the story is about is to flip through the pages or read the back cover and try to find a clue as to how the plot unfolds. This can sometimes be dangerous because not all documents give an accurate summary of what is going on. I once rented a movie expecting it to be a scary killer thriller in a trailer park. It ended up being scary for another reason, as several uncensored sex scenes were posted throughout the first two minutes of the feature film. I had no idea the movie was going to involve scenes like this and I was disgusted that there was no warning. I think items like this should be placed in a separate area or at least be required to give a summary of the type of offensive material they contain. Libraries could collect viewer feedback, allowing people who had checked out an item to write down what they thought about it. People could then read these comments before checking out this article. Viewer comments would be a good way to get someone else's opinion on the content of the article before someone else decides to praise it. Another effective way to solve this problem would be to assign a certain grade to materials, like the ratings of movies when they hit theaters. A specific rating would warn viewers or readers to check out something that is offensive or inappropriate. Libraries could also give specific age ranges based on the ratings given to an item, not allowing anyone under a certain age limit to view a building book. Ratings would help keep offensive books out of the reach of a child or anyone else who didn't want to be exposed. Libraries contain all kinds of material on every topic you can think of. They can open up a whole new world for learning and entertainment, but also a world of inappropriate items. I think items containing offensive material should either be placed in a separate area or have a certain rating in order to warn people before checking them out. Allowing viewers to comment on the material could also be very helpful. Libraries are a wonderful place full of great stories and adventures, so they should not be polluted with offensive and inappropriate material.

Do you find the books you read offensive? What about music or magazines? I do not know. I can't imagine why anyone would be offended by a book they chose to read. If you sit down and think, there should be few reasons why someone should be offended by a book written for the general public. I believe it is possible that there are books that contain offensive words or actions, but unless they are directed at the reader or are intentionally used to offend someone, it is not. is just a book. Many books, especially those on history, use the language and actions that were used during this time. They use them to show you and educate you on the way things were and how it was back then. Not very often, or that I have ever seen, authors make a book just to put someone down. I tend to see books explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set the tone of the book. Music, on the other hand, could be seen as different. A lot of people could take music badly. The majority of offensive problems generated by music come from the rap genre. Rappers tend to express themselves in depth and in doing so often use very offensive language. Personally, I don't mind music as they usually refer to their own life and the way things have been with them. Music can also be on the safe side. When you get calm, collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax. Therefore, music can be both ways, but it is mostly about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to. Then you have magazines. Personally, I think they are the worst of all. Magazines tend to go one way or the other. Either they put a person down and are completely negative towards them, or they are positive and only say good things about them. A big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, without always knowing the full story. In this case, they are very likely to be very offensive to the person or group they are talking about. Magazines always have a positive, but where there is positive, they have a negative side to put there. In these reviews, I believe there is nothing wrong with a library. There will always be negative and positive, but libraries tend to stick to the positive side. Also, if a book seems offensive to you, then no one can tell you that you can't just drop it and stop reading it. With music, only buy stuff you like and if you are easily offended, don't listen to that music. Libraries just give you the chance to get something that you might enjoy. There is no reason why someone cannot refrain from going for an offensive book. In saying that, it can go both ways. I don't believe there is anything used with library censorship as long as you can use your good judgment.

Imagine your favorite book, song and movie. The ones you love to watch, listen to or read a million times. The ones you keep browsing from the library over and over again because you love it so much. Now imagine that it came out of the libraries. What happened to him? You think it was checked out, but later you find it was taken off the shelves because someone found it offensive. What can you do? When you go to the library, you usually expect a huge selection of books and other materials. A library helps many people of all ages be able to choose what interests them. This is one of the reasons why libraries are so popular among everyone. If libraries started removing items from shelves that they find offensive, many people would not be able to find all of the items they love. I think everyone is entitled to their opinions. Libraries should accommodate as many people as they can. Removing material from the shelves @ MONTH1 makes some people happy, but it would also remove items that a lot of people find enjoyable. Libraries should not remove items from shelves if they are found to be offensive. Doing this could result in less material for people of all ages. If you find anything offensive, all you have to do is not check the book or other documents. In the words of Katherine Paterson, " If I have the right to take a book off the shelf - that job I hate - then you have the exact same right as well and everyone else too." And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. I believe if the items were to be taken off the shelves there would be less for others to enjoy. Removing documents from the shelves would be unfair to all readers. Everyone has a favorite book or movie that they enjoy reading or watching. If someone disagreed with this, it would not only prevent you from reading or watching what you like, but it would also deprive other readers who haven't had a chance to make up their own minds. on the material. A lot of people have different ideas about what they think is offensive. While some @ MONTH1 think some books have topics that are too daring for readers to read, others @ MONTH1 don't think they are. Pick up a popular children's book like @ CAPS1 from @ LOCATION1's. For some, this @ MONTH1 is one of the best books ever written. If someone disagreed with this and thought it was too serious or offensive to young readers, many new readers would never know about this book. They would never have had the chance to form their own opinion. I think censorship in libraries is an extreme manifestation of personal opinion. It's natural to disagree with someone. You may still meet people who don't share the same feelings about certain types of music or movies. Removing the material from the shelves would be unfair to people. If everyone took their least favorite book off the shelves and replaced it with their favorite, libraries would soon be filled with items that would only reach a certain audience. Libraries are meant to satisfy everyone's wants and tastes. In conclusion, removing items from the shelves because they are offensive to someone would not be fair. In fact, I believe it would create more problems for people. If an item someone was eagerly awaiting was no longer available due to censorship, many people @ MONTH1 even decide they don't want to go to the library anymore. The great thing about the library is that you have a huge selection of items to choose from. If censorship were to take place, the library would no longer be a place to profit. Censoring material would be telling a reader that their views were not as important as those of people who found them offensive. I believe if you find something so terribly offensive that you don't want it available in the library, first think about what you would do if the library didn't have your favorite things. Because after all, what you think is offensive @ MONTH1 is the best thing in the world for someone else.

Everyone has books they don't like or approve of. What if one of your children returns from a library with one of these books? My take on censorship in a library is if you don't like it, then don't read it. I think they should have a kids section and an adult section in the library so you don't have to worry about the problem. If a child wants a book from the adults section, he or she will need to have a parent with him or her. This way, the child would not bring home books that their parents would not approve of or allow them to read. If you're an adult and don't like a book, just don't read it. Maybe other readers like the book and don't want it taken off the shelf. They wouldn't be able to tell that the reason they want it off the shelf is because they don't want the kids to see it because the kids would need their permission to check the book anyway. . I think this way would be a lot easier for all readers to enjoy the library and they wouldn't have to worry about choosing a book that they don't like or that their parents wouldn't approve of.

Do I think that some books, music, films, magazines should be removed from our libraries. No, I don't think they should be deleted, they could be placed in another part of the library, away from all the other books that are not offensive. If they decided to remove these books, children would have a hard time finding out the truth. Book publishers only put out what they want children to learn. Most of the time, they leave out details of what really happened. So if they took out the offending books, music, movies, and magazines, a lot of kids would come home every day and sit still or cause trouble. From my own experience, I have enjoyed reading, listening and watching the offensive material they want to remove from our libraries. So if you don't like the offensive material, don't even look at it, it will solve your problem and teach your kids that. Overall I think they should keep the offensive materials. If people are still complaining, move it to another part of the library, to a separate room, or something like that. It should solve the problem of kids reading, listening and watching this stuff.

Be a responsible parent or child if you are against censorship. Censorship is really inevitable, and it shouldn't be a problem. If you don't want to read the magazine, book or watch the movie, don't watch it. Myriads of people avoid it every day if they don't want to see it, and a lot of people read and watch these bad types of movies. It's a personal choice and you don't have to be exposed to it if you don't want to. Those against censorship are trying ways to keep your children away from evil or from yourself, but don't try to suppress it altogether. One of the reasons for censorship is that it provides hordes of information and broadens your mind in different ways. The material or bad material you take out of it is your choice of reading. but I think some of them are good for children, not so that they can be corrupted. This is how children can also develop their imaginations. However, I think children should wait until they reach a certain age to read or watch this material until they are mature enough to separate fact from fiction. It also teaches a good @ CAPS1 that you may not have learned anywhere else. Many of these articles are about real life and what's going on today. I think it's great for kids and adults to know what's going on in the world. If you leave the children in the dark, you leave them without the right to object. Any parent can tell their child that something is bad for them, but you can never really tell unless you experience it for yourself. They can make up their own minds, and usually they do the best they can. Another reason for censorship is that it can be a loophole for some people. There are people who like to read fiction or the cheesy things in life. This keeps them going on a regular basis. You never know what someone likes to do. If someone is having a bad day and wants to read or watch what they like and find out that they can't do it now, chances are people are pissed off. If I was unable to do what I love to do, I would probably be angry or depressed. It is not always a fierce subject. If you want to keep your kids safe, then fine, but the people who can take care of them don't want it out of public view. Also keep it in libraries because if you don't want it, don't give your children's library passes. However, if you do, watch them while they're there. It costs money to go and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library. People who have no money or who do not want to own the books should not have to pay for them when they can be hidden from whom they should be. The last reason for censorship is that it keeps people interested. It also teaches a lot of information. Not only is it entertaining, but there is also so much vocabulary you get from these books. I personally learned most of my @ CAPS1 from books, and hardly had to pay for any of them. When you don't have the money to buy all the books you want, the library has the same information for you, but it's just more available rather than going to the store. Whoever finds it offensive is fine. No one is forcing you to take these items off the shelves, and neither is that what other people see. If people really want to read these articles, somehow they're going to ban them from one place isn't going to remove censorship from our world. Children are already exposed to it at school and on television. They need to learn more than just the right material if they are to understand the real world. Censorship is seen as good, bad and neutral. No one is forcing you to look at it, but on the other hand, no one can force you to walk away from it. Let people make their own decisions. If you continue to complain, many complaints will be directed to you. Censorship should be seen as " sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me ". That being said, don't avoid the inevitable.

I don't think these types of books should be taken off the shelves. Everyone has their likes and dislikes with music, books, movies, magazines, etc. If the reader does not like the book, then the reader will not continue to read the book. If the listener does not like rap music, they will stop listening and try to find another type of music. This topic is about personal opinion and choice. If that was me, then I would say yes to allowing censored material. I like to get the full effect of things. I want to hear the rawness of a song or the anger of a character in a book. I don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars on a censored word. I want to see this word and feel its full effect. I am reading the very controversial book '@ CAPS1 of @ ORGANIZATION1'. As you know @ MONTH1, the author of this book is called @ PERSON1. Another thing you know @ MONTH1 is the use of the '@ CAPS2-word'. This is a very controversial book because it doesn't call out black or colored people, it calls them the '@ CAPS2-word' throughout most of the book. Most people now think it's very racist. But back in the days of @ LOCATION1, it was very commonly said and used in his company. It wasn't racist then, I mean it still was, but it wasn't as controversial as it is today. Now, critics and some readers do not agree with this term and believe that the book should not be kept in libraries or read for it at all. I have to disagree though. I understand why he used that word, it was a common word in his day. If you take that word out of the book, you lose some of the history of the old south. People have the freedom of expression to say whatever they want, whether in writing or verbally. I honestly say some of these censored words. Most of the time, these words are said when I am angry with myself or another person. People can't control what we say, so why should they control what we write or sing? Just a thought. In saying this, on the other hand, I can see why people don't want these censored words. Maybe they just don't want their little child to say a censored word in class to the teacher or another classmate. It's understandable, but you can't protect your kids from censored words. They are everywhere. From video games to movies and even most books now. You cannot control what other people do or say. It's their freedom to do whatever they want.

I don't think censorship in labs is fair, for a lot of reasons. The first reason is that all the books and content that a public library offers to the community should be open to everyone. The second reason is that what you might think isn't appropriate, for someone it might not be. The last reason is that an author has the right to express himself or herself about their book as they wish, without having to fear that their book will be taken off the shelves of public libraries. My first reason I think censorship isn't fair is that all content in a library should be open to the community. For example, if a student needed to research how black slaves were treated in history, he might not be able to find a book, find information about it because someone thought that books like this were offensive to black people, so in this case this student could not find any information on his subject, due to the censorship in his library, so instead of going to a library, he would have to go somewhere else where he might find the wrong kind of information. The second reason is that what you might think is offensive, might not be offensive to another person. So why should your perspective affect another person? It would not be fair for a person's perspective to limit the choices a person has when going to the library. Censorship might take your favorite set of books from the public library because a group of people thought it was offensive. My last reason is that an author has the right to express himself or herself about their book as they wish, without having to fear that their book will be taken off the shelves of public libraries for its content. Sometimes the content of the books is necessary to make the book descriptive and interesting to the reader. Content that you might find offensive is content that really helps the reader understand the book better. These are the reasons why I think censorship is not fair. Because if we had censorship on public libraries, then we wouldn't have any books on the shelves to read. So these are my reasons to support my opinion.

No book should be removed from the shelves for any reason. Books are a very important part of most people's everyday life. Whether used for school or just for entertainment, they are used for a good purpose and always come in handy. People have different tastes and interests, and everyone wants to be able to read whatever they want without having to worry about whether the books will still be on the shelves tomorrow. For some people, books are a great hobby. They help you learn and even cope with difficult life situations. Books are the world for most people and without them these people wouldn't know what to do with their lives. No one should speak out loud to take away something important to others, even if it is offensive. All books have a purpose and a message that they want to get across, otherwise the authors wouldn't have taken their life's time to write them and get them published. The author writes to tell a story to people, whether good or bad, he or she wanted to spread that story to inform people. Stories are obviously important to the author and important to readers who love their books. Authors should not be punished just because someone is offended by what they have written. If people are so offended, they should just stay away from books written by a certain author. There are many books and many different authors that a person can choose from. They don't have to pick on certain authors just because they didn't like what others might like. There are so many books, and there's a good chance there is always a book that offends someone. If we get rid of every book that offends people, we won't have many books anymore, and without books we will have nothing. Books are the cornerstone of most people's education and daily life. We won't learn the new ideas the authors bring us if people keep getting offended and pulling them off the shelves. Books should stay on the shelves. They are important to everyone whether they want to admit it or not. Without the books people wouldn't be where they are today

Libraries should censor some of the material they make available to the public. This is important because a child could easily access offensive material. Censorship is very important for libraries because we don't want our children to be influenced by offensive material found in their libraries. Libraries would not even have to get rid of the offensive material they took from the shelves. A good idea for them is to move them all to an adult section so that children cannot see them. Libraries would not lose money and they would keep kids away from things that are not suitable for them. There is no reason to give people access to material that might be offensive to other people. There are only a few reasons why I think people should have access to offensive material. Someone might need to use a book that contained something offensive, but they would all be taken somewhere else. I think it depends on how offensive the materials are, as to whether or not they should be taken off the shelves. While I'm sort of divided on this question, there are some really good reasons why offensive material is kept off the shelves. These documents are not suitable for young people in our country and they should not have access to them. We should censor libraries so no one gets hurt

Book @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 my name is @ CAPS3 and I don't think books, magazines etc. of @ CAPS4 should be taken off the shelves because. Books help people read and concentrate. In my case, the more books the better and those books have been there to keep us up to date. Without them, we wouldn't have a brief description of what happened in the past. Books have always been there to support us and every story should have funny details. Without the books, I don't know what we would do without them. Books have been the best thing in my life and @ CAPS5 hurts us to know you don't want to get rid of them afterwards, you made us read them when we were kids so what's the use of getting rid of them when we got there so far. In magizine's there is a lot to know about our people and how we live. We have come this far to reach the top. At least when we read we know how to do certain things. For example, do you remember when you were a kid and you always hated to read, but now a whole new change has entered your life and now you know what to do. My favorite book I ever read was @ CAPS6 and @ CAPS5 was irrelevant but @ CAPS5 also made sense. We need to keep these stories alive and I'm not going to let you take away what we love to do. I love books and hate to see them go. these books were there when we were kids and we have to keep the lag. Reading is the best thing in life and @ CAPS5 helps clear our minds. Through reading I was able to explain all of this to you and how much I support these books. @ CAPS5 would destroy our country, states, cities, schools and book clubs so please don't delete our book that's all we ask and not only will you make me happy but you will make our readers very happy. Thanks for reading this and have a nice day

Although they may offend some people, materials in libraries that might be considered “ offensive ” are in fact good to keep. If people who find offensive materials in libraries are upset about the lack of censorship within the library itself, they should rethink the situation and consider that ' offensive ' materials that are left in libraries could be viewed as appropriate IF the viewer is ready to experience them. If a person doesn't want to be exposed to things in libraries that might be considered offensive, then they can avoid those materials altogether. If parents find library materials offensive, they should supervise their children while they visit their library. Materials that might be considered offensive @ MONTH1 are actually good educational media that a person could learn from. If @ CAPS1 in libraries goes up, " then we don't have any more books on the shelves for any of us ." @ CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as today. Some books, films and other items that can be found in libraries are well labeled as inappropriate. However, these materials can be educational and should not be removed from libraries altogether just because some of them are deemed too crass, vulgar, or adult-like for younger children. Parents should supervise their children when they are in a library so that they don't let them stumble upon something they don't want them to see again. If something is labeled as inappropriate for the children to see by the parents, then it is the responsibility of the parents to ensure that their child does not fall on it. Much of what @ MONTH1 is considered inappropriate and in need of focus in libraries to date @ MONTH1 actually has educational value or significance. There are books and films based on real stories that have taken place that could be advertised by parents as " not suitable for the eyes of children ". However, that doesn't mean that libraries should have to remove material from their shelves just because parents @ MOIS1 don't necessarily think or agree that it would be appropriate for their child to read or see it. It is the responsibility of parents to ensure that their child does not check what they consider inappropriate. Much of the stuff in libraries that might be considered inappropriate for children has good educational value and should not have to be removed from library shelves just because parents find it unsuitable for their age. of their children. @ CAPS1 in libraries should remain the same as it is today so that those who want to see or read the stories or films can do so without having to purchase them. If parents want to make a big deal out of how libraries keep materials that are not appropriate for their children, they can either skip a library or watch their children closely if they bring them with them when they visit. 'a visit to the library. I have found that when I visit my library, I see it as a source of knowledge that has been brought together in one place, written and created by thousands of authors, all of whom have taken a long time to create it. If we were to take those books or movies out of libraries, I think it would take away the rights that people have in materials that SHOULD be provided by a library. @ CAPS1 in libraries should stay the same as it is today so people can enjoy whatever should be there, even if some part is tagged as inappropriate by parents

Imagine a world where almost all other books are banned for one reason or another. This world is not a world I want to live in. I think the censorship in libraries is bad. For three reasons, really, the first being that people have a right to all the information they want. The second is that people do not have the power to take opportunities away from others. The last point I will make is that no information is bad information. Because we are in @ LOCATION1, I guess we are talking about censorship in @ CAPS1 libraries. If that is the case, then I think it is unconstitutional to ban any book, or to censor any material. Censoring books is like closing your eyes to the one who reads the material; they don't see it for what it really is or what it is for. If the prompt includes foreign countries, then I think humans have no right to influence what others read. It's idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world all countries would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender. I think people should see it as it is. If something is offensive, it is offensive. It is the person's choice to read or listen or not. This brings me to my last point, that no information can be bad information. Whether it is profane or offensive in any way, there is always some sort of meaning behind it. Rappers like @ PERSON2 and @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, who I've found all of their songs to make sense of whether they're personal or trying to send a message to people. There are books like @ CAPS4 for @ LOCATION2, by @ ORGANIZATION1, which was recently banned by some school libraries due to graphic scenes. The people who banned the book don't realize the book doesn't talk about these scenes. There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and the redemption behind it. Another more famous book that has been banned from school libraries is The @ CAPS5 in the @ CAPS6, by @ PERSON1, which is a coming-of-age story about a boy. In conclusion, I don't think it's fair to ban books or music from libraries. No one has the right. There is always a meaning inside. The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always makes sense; they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason. By banning books, they take people's chances to grow and expand.

Censorship is very important, especially when you are referring to libraries. I believe that every individual has the right to an opinion. If a book, magazine, movie, etc., is offensive to a particular person or to a wide variety of people, those people should consult with an official who has authority and decides what goes on the shelves and what that they think or feel. their choice of selection. Around the world, there are many different types of minorities, racial groups, as well as differences in political groups, (@ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2). Even though these separate groups are extremely different from each other, they all share one thing in common. No matter who believes what or who supports whom, everyone will always have a different voice. Some people @ MONTH1 think that posting particular materials on library shelves is rather offensive to specific people. Whereas, as others like me say as said earlier, if you have a problem with something that is displayed, you need to reach out to someone who will listen to what you have to say. For example, I cannot express that I want something removed from a library shelf just because I am the one who finds the material to be of concern. Everything is not decided by me. It would be incredibly rude to say that something that is offensive to me might not be offensive to someone else. Just because I don't approve of something doesn't give me the right to voluntarily remove something from the shelf. It all has to do with freedom of expression. However, yes, you do have the right to say whatever is bothering you, but you do not have the privilege to do whatever you want at all times because you have opposing views. It's true to say that we all think we don't want to see inappropriate material displayed on library shelves, especially for the sake of children, so libraries should take into account restricting specific areas of a library to adult views only. I know suggestive material can be a concern for one, so not allowing children of a certain age to see certain material would be a great idea for all officials, adults and concerned parents.

A few months ago, I was at the local library looking for the perfect book. After an hour of research, I chose one. I was happy with my choice when I checked it out. As I began to read my book anxiously, I discovered language, addiction, and sexual content. As a teenager, I neither want nor need to be exposed to inappropriate material. No one should be exposed to this, and because of this experience, I think censorship in libraries is a must. Due to sexual content, drug addiction, and foul language, one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket to a movie rated @ CAPS1. I believe that since this is true for movies, it should also be true for books, magazines and music. @ CAPS2 literature is unnecessary and inappropriate at any age. The world exposes certain publications to children and then is shocked when they see children in prisons, gangs and other horrific situations. The world has set its standards too low, and the children of today's society are following in our footsteps. Author, Katherine Paterson, once said: " ... if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this work that I hate - then you have exactly the same right, as does everyone else. world. " The quote @ CAPS2 shows the impact that people have on future generations. Everyone has their own opinion and @ CAPS2 is mine. As a reader of the daily newspaper, I could no longer silence my voice. I had to step in and say something. I am part of a generation that is greatly affected by the world in a negative way. The first step in changing this is to set high standards. Protect future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to. Situations will improve when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive material from the shelves. If libraries censor documents, then the next time I want to find the perfect book, I will.

Each individual has their own opinion on censorship. Some people think that in some cases it is perfectly fine, but others disagree. I am a person who thinks that in some cases things should be censored. Schools have the right to censor what is put in their libraries so that their students can read, especially magazines. Some magazines contain articles that are not appropriate for class time or even in the school building. Schools @ MONTH1 don't want something inappropriate on their shelves where students can see it. Censorship is even more understandable in primary schools. Libraries for young students should be watched even more carefully. Younger people, like those in elementary school, don't really know what they should and shouldn't read. In public libraries things are a little different. Parents can usually monitor what their children are checking. Most adults can read the summary on the back of the book to find out what is being extracted. If the summary is too vague, then they can read a few pages inside the book. A few times I went to the public library and looked at a book that I thought was suspenseful. When I got home and started reading it, it turned out I was wrong. The book was a romance novel that I didn't want to read. So I returned the book to the library. Most of the time you can read the synopsis on the back of the book, but that doesn't always say too much about the book. So the best thing you can do is read a few pages of the book before you consult it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion on censorship. I believe that in some cases things available for verification should be censored. In other cases, things should be left to adults and parents to decide what they want to be allowed to check.

Now, if one person has a right to something, then it would be right that others have the same. It would be like having six kids in a room and for no reason giving three kids a cookie and not the other three who aren't right now, right. so if a person buys this book, then another person wants this same book, then they would have every right to take this book and there is really nothing to say to them. i know how it feels not to have the same right as everyone like once my teacher gave my friend a piece of chewing gum for no reason and i was angry because i didn't have I thought if he had a piece of gum for no reason, the rest of us should get one for no reason. like said you give a right to one person then you should give that right to another person now i could understand if three people were involved in a fight and the third person was standing there watching the not allowed to go to jail but the two who were physically fighting so they have every right to sit in jail and think about the fight now the third guy who was watching he is not allowed to keep in any video of the fight and he should get a ticket

WHAT DO I THINK? When I heard about the problems faced by some libraries ; I said to myself. What's the big deal with censorship of movies, records, books, and magazines. I know children shouldn't be around the tongue of volgurus heard or read. Book that has photos @ MONTH1 not for the eyes of our young children either. Libraries should find a solution. I thought if they wanted to they could make book rooms for certain ages. When people take these books off the shelves to point out or put this book somewhere else away from their kids, they make working people much harder. Their should also be an adult with you if you enter the room. Adult must be @ NUM1 or higher. If a child is found in their alum, library employees will contact the child's parents as @ NUM2 offinse. The same goes for the second time your caght. The @ NUM3 time you are caught you will receive a phone call to your parents and banned from the librery for @ NUM4 months. If you live in a big city, you @ MONTH1 have better, bigger libraries. Some libraries have so many books that you may need to get a Cherry Picker to reach them. I know I'm a little off topic now, but that's part of what I'm going to talk about. There are massive libraries and little liebrareis. It's almost like the difference between preschool and college. Now that's a big difference. What I think, cities that have a larger population should consist of two libraries on the buy side. The one on the left would be for toddlers ranging from @ NUM5 to @ NUM6. This library will be very busy. The library will include a nursery so that parents can search for a book in silence. Cidren at ages of @ NUM7- @ DATE1 will also be in the library on the left, but upstars. They will have books made just for their age groups. The will also be able to watch television or play minor games that do not have computer violence. The library on the right will look like a duplicate of the one on the left but is completely different on the inside. The reason they would do this is that the kids wouldn't try to get in because he looks cooler than the other. Our children admire us in many different ways. Some @ MONTH1 understand how to deal with our every move. So when they see what you are looking at, listen and even read; they might want to do it too. Know what I think most of you have learned from this is how to keep your kids the same. I don't mean to say like they hurt themselves or anything, but it helps them stay together and not know what they should go through when they are 8 years old. So once again I would like to let you know that we can fix this problem. We want to keep your kids away from bad things

No, I don't believe there are some materials that shouldn't be taken off the shelves because I don't see how they are offensive to others. Even though his war films are about what these men went through and they fought and lost friends. You just don't see the people kill and shoot, you see the emotions of the men and his emotion for you to see that. Every book in there should stay there because some people need it for a project or to study that person and a lot of the books have a lot of history you can learn from. The only thing I think should be deleted is the music because if its rap or something like that should not be allowed in libraries it brings hatred and often murder to the country and it shouldn't. not be allowed. Some magazines should be allowed, like running, sports, or the military, but all the other bad stuff should stay out because if they see it, the kind of stuff that shouldn't be seen will come to mind. That's what I think of this whole idea

There are all kinds of books, movies, and even magazines. Most libraries have a huge selection for all types of readers or people who want to watch a movie. They might even have things that young minds shouldn't read. Have you ever thought about what would happen if a small child clung to something they weren't supposed to read? When it comes to things like this, there is a wide range of topics. Some of them are not supposed to be examined until old age. That's why I think there should be a certain section where only a certain number of ages are allowed to go. When it comes to books, there will always be books that are not suitable for young minds. They could include several things that could mark a child for life. Some of the things they could read are probably things their parents would like to talk to them about later in the future. Books are great for learning, don't get me wrong, but there are some that are more related to adults. There are now a ton of books for kids to read and parents won't have to worry about reading them anymore. Another way libraries can help is by placing movies in a certain section. The library could create a section called “ family and children ”. This section would be a perfect place where parents wouldn't have to worry about their kids having misconceptions about movies. In our library we have this section. My grandma and I would always go there and find an amazing family movie to watch together. Finding a great family movie to watch is the best feeling there is. Finally, the last way a library might help is to make sure the child is old enough to read a book or movie. It is clear that a child of @ NUM1 should not watch a movie rated @ CAPS1, this is simply not true. Libraries should ensure that the child is the correct age to watch the film. That's why film companies rate movies, so they can give people an idea of what's good and bad about the movie. Libraries should also ensure that a child is viewing the correct type of magazine or book. People who work there could flip through it first and make sure it's the right kind of book they should be reading. There are endless ways to protect the minds of young people. I don't think libraries should ban books, magazines, movies, or even music. I think they should just make sure the kids check out what they are allowed to read. Books are a great way to learn things, but they should learn things that are sustainable for their age. Libraries are there so that we can learn and have fun. I think people would get mad if they forbade what they like. They should just keep an eye on what the kids are watching. Thank you for your time.

The last thing I want my kids to see in an @ CAPS1 is offensive material. a @ CAPS1 is considered as a learning area. A place where people can learn new things and deepen their knowledge. If there are dirty magazines, sex movies, offensive music, or inappropriate websites available for children, it completely defeats the goal of having a safe learning environment. My opinion is that libraries should be used primarily for educational purposes. This means that there should be appropriate books and magazines which are also age appropriate. Computers are also a great resource, but can contain a lot of offensive content. My take on this issue is that the computers in @ CAPS1 need to be monitored. If someone wants to search for inappropriate images and websites, they should do so in their spare time, in the privacy of their own home. It should not be allowed in public where innocent children are exposed to it. It is not fair to children, and it is not fair to parents who have tried to protect them from this kind of suggestive material. I'm sure there are a lot of people who would disagree with my proposal. However, these @ MONTH1s are the type of people who are not morally structured like me, or those who don't have children to look after. Or maybe they just aren't as concerned about the problem. They will say that there is no real need to monitor computers or that they have blocked websites. Yes they @ MONTH1 think there is no real wrong. But that @ MONTH1 is just because that's how they were brought up, causing them to think the same way. With magazines, some @ MONTH1 argue that children will sometimes be exposed to suggestive material, so why not now ? But if everyone started to think like this, all morality would be forgotten. In some cases, morality may not be the issue at all. In fact, religion might be the most important issue. Many people are religious and their particular religion @ MONTH1 is against viewing suggestive and "ungodly" material. Parents won't want to walk into a @ CAPS1 with their kids and find them from pictures that go against what they believe in. They will think that it loses the innocence of their child. Having these things out in the open and accessible to children and teens might unintentionally send them a message that engaging in sexual activity is okay when their religion is not. When I was little I remember going to @ CAPS1 a lot with my mom to pick out books for school. I vividly remember seeing some naughty magazines on a table as I walked towards the children's section. My mother was appalled that they had those that were laid out like this in the open, and especially right next to where the children's books were. She complained to one of the librarians and asked him to remove them. The librarian apologized and agreed that the placement of the magazines was a bit out of place. Since then my mom is a little skeptical and dreads going to this @ CAPS1. Guess that is why I am so involved in this question and the reason for this informative article. I didn't write this to blame anyone or to judge people for their beliefs. Rather, the purpose of my writing was to educate the general public about these issues and to explain my point of view. I don't see the reason to have these documents handy in a @ CAPS1 where almost everyone has access to them. I don't understand whether they need to be available in a @ CAPS1, or if there is a need at all. I hope that by reading this I opened the eyes of some concerned parents, or at least made them aware of the matter. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, @ PERSON1

What would you like if someone took a book from you, just because it had @ CAPS1 language or a nasty meaning ? I mean, sure, there are some books that should be censored, but in doing so you are excluding the great @ CAPS1 novels of the past. These novels were acceptable at the time. If you want to censor boks, do so in your own library. Personally, I don't believe in censorship of books. If the author intended to write the book this way, the writing should stay that way. Censorship destroys the books and the learning program of many students. You would censor a school book if it had @ CAPS1 graphic text between its covers. There are tons of books that have foul language and some perverse ideas. These books were written to educate our civilization. If you remove these books, you will harm the learning capacity of our societies. Books, I believe, shouldn't be offensive unless you're a conscious person. Reading a book is a delightful experience, it shouldn't be censored. In my personal experience, I have had no problem reading an exquisite novel that has minor graphic details @ CAPS1. I don't care if there is an explicit word in my reading. Although, @ CAPS1 no one wants to remove offensive articles, not for the public good, but for their personal gain. These offensive tactics are a disgrace for literature and culture. @ CAPS1 books written in today's world are much less self-explanatory than before. Thus, we would create this unwanted barrier. When the @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 burned the books of @ CAPS4, we almost lost an entire culture and literature of civilization. This should never happen to literature today. If we censor the books in our libraries then we will lose some aspect of our culture. Censorship of reading material in our libraries should be reserved for personal libraries and only for personal libraries. Libraries are public for a reason. In conclusion, censorship should not be placed in libraries as it disrupts public literature. If books were meant to be read that way, so be it. We are not the destroyers of classical literature, and we should never come to this.

I don't believe they should be taken off the shelves because the folks at @ CAPS1 always come in to get that stuff. @ The folks at CAPS1 say it's not folded for little kids "so keep your kids away from that". People @ CAPS1 don't like it and people @ CAPS1 do. I'm one of those people who enjoys this stuff, because no one can tell us what we can and can't watch or say. It's our life if we want to watch this stuff or read about it, we can. No one tells people that they should half read it or even watch it. If you don't like it, don't watch it. The @ CAPS2 kind of stuff should be on the side where you know what you're going to watch and away from the kids @ CAPS2 shouldn't even be a problem. @ CAPS2 are just people who think they are high class and think if you watch this or watch this or read that you are a dust bag. This is the opinion. In conclusion, I think if you don't read the @ CAPS2 stuff or watch the @ CAPS2 stuff, you are trying to be something that you are not. Trying to act better than anyone else gets your class to read something like this. We all laugh at the @ CAPS2 kind of stuff.

In my opinion, books that @ MONTH1 seem offensive to someone should be kept on a shelf. This means that people should be allowed to look them up in the library and read them even if some people think those particular books are offensive, or @ MONTH1 seems offensive. A person should be able to read an article without feeling that someone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive. Yes, but at the same time, it's up to you, the reader, to choose a book that doesn't make you uncomfortable and that won't make you uncomfortable. Do not choose a book to read that discriminates against soccer players if you are a soccer player, as it is most likely going to upset you or make you uncomfortable. Well, let's say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players and that makes you feel uncomfortable, don't pick up the book and go and complain to someone about what the book or article is about you. made to feel if you choose it to start with. If this makes you uncomfortable, put the book or article down. No one is forcing you to read or watch it. People should be allowed to read any type of books they want and about anything that interests them. Just because an article or book is offensive to you doesn't mean it is offensive to other people. If we were to remove all books, articles, magazines from library shelves, there would be no books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person. Movies are a whole other problem in and of themselves. There are many types of movies out there, and in those types of movies there are types of things people do in movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc. If you don't swear and say you're going to watch '@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2' you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a swear word. If you don't like @ CAPS4 people jump weird places and scare you, then you aren't going to watch '@ CAPS3.' The folks at @ CAPS4 find the movies offensive or not to their liking, they usually try to make a big deal out of it and sue the people who made the movie. If you do this, you cause more problems than it's actually worth. The same with movies as books, if we were to remove all movies from theaters, and only stores in general that are offensive to at least one person in any way, we wouldn't have any more movies to watch. because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people and make them feel uncomfortable. In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article or magazine that shocks you, forget it. Keep this book or anything out of your reach and in other people, because at the end of the day, no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they have. written, performed or sung offends you. In my opinion, you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to.

Should books, music, magazines, etc. be removed from shelves deemed offensive ? Everyone has their own opinion on this issue. During my years of reading, I read a few books that were questionable. I wouldn't say someone else can't relate to this. Personally, I don't think you should take anything off the shelves. Growing up, our parents try to keep things from us, at this time of life do not need to see. I can agree with the age limit but you can't hide everything. Isn't it better to let the kids know what's going on before letting them go and find out for themselves ? You will probably get more than one answer to this question. My personal views @ MONTH1 are different from the person sitting next to me, but I think you should be allowed to read and see and listen to whatever you want. The world is not a safe place, it is scary and mean to people. When I raise my children, when they are younger, there will be some things that they will not know and will not see. But that's just a part of raising your kids, when they get old and start asking questions, I'll answer with the truth. Does hiding these things from our children lie to them? I should say yes to this question. By taking these things away from young people, we are telling them that it is not out there, that the world is perfect and that there is no harm. Some people would actually say that, but I have to tell them that they did not live. Even to this day, there is segregation for all, not only against races, but within our own race itself. To conclude my oppion, I must say that we should be free to read and see what we want. We shouldn't, let nobody see it and see them, and then let them go out into the world, and have complete culture shock. Teach your kids what's going on, let them know the truth about the world. Are there any materials that need to be removed from the shelves? No, @ CAPS1 is used to judge what we see and hear ?

Children all over the world find themselves wandering the library every day. These children explore the world of literature to learn and grow. Library @ CAPS2 is a wonderful place with many literary genres such as children's books, non-fiction books, fiction books, adult books, movies, etc. There are certain genres for certain age groups, and there is a lot of material in libraries that parents @ CAPS1 want their kids to even hear by name. I think it's @ CAPS2 normal for parents to feel this, but it's @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 needed. Children should have the right to explore the world of literature as they see fit. Reading different types of literature @ CAPS2 is a great learning medium, and library shelves @ CAPS1 should be stripped of books taking up space. There are many types of books, movies, magazines, and music on the shelves of a library. These are all great forms of literature and a way to learn different things. However, there are many parents who @ CAPS1 want their children to be “ exposed ” to such materials. If a child wants to read a book, let him read it to cry out loud! Parents can say that @ CAPS2 is "corrupting" their child, but books and music do not corrupt children, it is the environment and those around them that have claimed to have the capacity to cause such corruption. It is @ CAPS2 a very normal thing for a parent to protect their child, but to a certain extent. A parent @ CAPS2 supposed to help their child grow up and learn right from wrong. They have every right to protect their child from the dangers of the world, but @ CAPS1 to prevent them from learning the art of literature. They are @ CAPS1 supposed to protect their child from all the faults in the world, even if he @ CAPS2 has a book. Literature in all its forms @ CAPS2 a great way to learn. Libraries should not have to strip the shelves of the wonderful books crated in the literary world for entertainment or learning. If a child wants to read a book, he should have the right to read that book. They should be able to explore however they want.

Libraries are everywhere and all together, they contain millions of books that influence everyone who reads them. Whether reading a book on @ PERSON1 or @ CAPS1, there is always something influential to read. Some books have more adult themes or references to certain topics that most adults find inappropriate for readers of certain ages. The question is, is it a good idea for books that are now censored to be taken off the shelves? In personal opinion; yes these types of books are influential, yes it is possible that it could negatively affect the youth of @ DATE1, but everyone has the right to read what interests them. Being influential is a top priority for most reading materials. There is a point to prove or a parallel story to share in most books. Is this a bad thing? Is it “ wrong ” to explain a point of view or to explain a life experience ? No, having experiences is only half the purpose of living; sharing is the rest. The @ ORGANIZATION1 explains one of the biggest downfalls of @ LOCATION1 and how it brutally affected those struggling for life and money. Twilight shows the softer side of love and that anyone can be happy if they put their heart on someone. These are not just experiences but things to ponder upon, and losing these factors in life would be a horrible mistake. The youth of @ DATE1 is portrayed primarily in a negative light. Whether they are viewed as monsters or perhaps even as the offspring of the devil ; our young people need influence. Reading is one of the main sources of inspiration for students to grow and develop. Most students find reading boring. At school, you are not offered what you want to read. Lists are made and guidelines created so that only certain things are read and taught. Young adults need creativity, and books are there to light up their passionate minds. Carrying out the books that are of interest to students and young adults is one of the many growing problems that contributes to people not wanting to read. Teachers, principals, businessmen and even children deserve the right to read what they like. If you were a sports specialist and all of a sudden the people decided that sports newspapers and sports themselves were too harmful and were a bad influence on people ; what would you do when all of a sudden everything sporting was taken away from you? You would lose your career. Love novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something that everyone is shaking in their minds. Removing something that is related to something so natural in everyday life would have serious repercussions; especially for those who like these books very much. Revoking the rights to literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed. Influencing people to think about things that are seen by everyone is not a bad thing when it can be used to inspire the people in their lives. Just because someone is a student or a child does not mean that a literary work can spoil their mind. Removing something that can contribute to the everyday art of living would slowly create a world less creative, inventive, and inspired. Not everyone believes that some books are bad, and I am one of those thousands.

Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive ? Should they be magazines and etc. but set up for this age group? Should they type things but in the @ CAPS1 with children? Should they be in the @ CAPS1 period ? I think the @ CAPS1 should contain all types of books, because that's what an @ CAPS1 is for. But I think if people find it offensive to have these kinds of books open to children, they should ask @ CAPS1 to change the way they have books. But I also think the @ CAPS1 should book them in a part where they have adult stuff and book. Because this kind of book is not made for the eyes of children. The @ CAPS1 should put the ages of the people on the @ CAPS1 cards so that this wants to be a problem for the people or the @ CAPS1. Because then you wouldn't know how old they are. And only @ NUM1 years old can books and magazines, etc., which is not suitable for the eyes of young children. But I think it is offensive to people who have young children and there children read it. And that's offensive to people who just don't like what books, music, and magazines represent. One thing I don't agree with is that books should be taken off the shelves because there are so many people who come to @ CAPS1 just to read them. And the people who read these books are going to be upset that you took the books off the shelves. Because I personally love magnifies, books, music and movies and I don't find anything shocking about them. And I love movies because it gives me something to do and watch when I'm home. I also think movies and music are something we all love about @ CAPS1. Because it gives me and my friends something to do after school. So if you take away the thing we like, what will we have to do after school when we go to @ CAPS1. And the thing that was named makes @ CAPS1 so fun and peaceful. @ CAPS1 is a place where you can come and complain about your day. Without them, trying to take shelves is going to be boring. People who have nothing to do for the day come to @ CAPS1 and look for this offensive stuff.

Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. People should have the choice of reading or watching what they want. Just because one person finds a book shocking doesn't mean another person will find it shocking as well. The library's need to let the community judge what it finds offensive or not. Some parents say they don't want bad or certain materials in the library because their kids could read them. If parents are so concerned about what their children are seeing, then they should sit down with their child and discuss why they should not be able to read or watch this type of material. Parents should be able to make their children understand why they should not read or look at certain materials instead of accusing the libraries themselves of simply having the materials. If certain books or films are deemed very offensive by the public, they should be placed in a special area. This special area should be clearly marked with a sign indicating “ content @ CAPS1 ” and should only be visible to adults. This would solve many problems such as being able for children to verify certain documents. Doing this would allow people who wish to view this type of material to access the material. It would also solve a problem as it would be in a back corner or in an area where few people go so kids won't see it very easily. The best solution to this problem would still allow libraries to put certain material found to be offensive in their library. But instead put age restrictions so you can view the material and also put it in a different section of the library than normal material.

Do I think that some material, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive ? I understand some parents wouldn't want their kids to read a drug book or watch a gang movie, but libraries shouldn't have to take them off their shelves. There isn't a movie, book, or magazine that everyone will approve of. Just because some people find it offensive doesn't mean they should have the power to determine what materials libraries have and don't have on their shelves. One of the reasons I think certain items shouldn't be taken out of a library just because a few people find it offensive is what Katherine Paterson said in her quote. She said if there was a book that a few parents didn't want their kids to see and they had to complain and have the right to remove it from the library shelf. Then, sooner or later, more and more parents will come complaining about a different book, movie or magazine every two days. Soon there would be no more books, films, magazines in the library. Another reason why I think we shouldn't have a say in what libraries contain is as follows. As you know there are many different cultural families living in @ LOCATION1. Some people say Bibles should be allowed in libraries. Half of the population agree with this statement, the other half think it is ridiculous and they wonder how they could even suggest doing such a thing. How would a library handle this situation. If we gave people the right to decide what was held in libraries. There would be a bunch of people who would walk in and say they don't believe in @ CAPS1 so they need to get these Bibles off the shelf before their kids read them. Then as soon as @ CAPS1 believers hear about it. They would come into this library and complain that they were taking it off the shelves. There would be no way to please everyone, so libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves. My third and final reason why I think the public shouldn't have a say in this matter is if libraries were forced to remove items from their shelves just because a few people complained about certain books or movies. So why couldn't people do this in restaurants, movie rental companies, or outlet stores with clothes they don't approve of. If it were to happen to one business, it should happen to all businesses and in my opinion. The only person who should have a say in what they have in their store / library is the person who pays for it and that is the owner. It is their responsibility to know what is too far regarding movies or books etc. The public must accept these choices. You have to look at it from their point of view. Would you like them to walk into your business and start complaining, then you are forced to get rid of this item because of them. This is just not the right way to deal with it. After reading all of my opinions, I hope you see where I'm from and see that it just wouldn't be human to do that. It never was like this and it should never be like this. Obviously, parents don't want their kids to see inappropriate things. But that's not our say and we just have to face the fact that this is how it should be

Today we live in a world where there are many different political, religious and personal opinions; and over time these views will only become more varied and widespread. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to respond to all the people that every person encounters in the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even more difficult to have different books for all different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions. Take @ LOCATION1 for example. There are many different races and people of different religions living here. This is a place that has been through a @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 before and fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things our country has overcome, there will always be arguments and disagreements over these issues. When there are different opinions, there will always be different books on the same subject from different points of view. As readers of these books, we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensive comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone will have the same outlook on life as we do. When I was in eighth grade I was @ CAPS6 @ ORGANIZATION1 with friends. One of them was pulling his eyes back (like someone would if they were imitating a person @ CAPS3) because it was itchy. A very pregnant woman @ CAPS3 @ CAPS5 walked in and took offense at my friends' eye movements. She yelled at us @ CAPS6 and said, "I would have thought your parents raised you better than that." @ CAPS6 first we didn't understand what this woman was talking about until we realized our friend had pulled her eyes back. It showed us that different people can take offense at different things because of their heritage. We cannot do anything against the expansion of cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of some people to match those of our own beliefs or change the fact that all different people will express their opinions and see them as “ right ”. However, we can change the way we view these people. We have to understand that there is no “ right ” when you are dealing with multiple opinions. @ CAPS6 At this point we need to embrace everyone for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs. So the next time you buy a book @ CAPS6 from the library, read the summary and verify that the author agrees with you before bringing the book home or there will be disagreements in your views. . If you get a book and you don't agree with it or are offended by it, there is no one to be angry @ CAPS6 but yourself for not checking the position of the author on the subject before you start reading it

I am convinced that every book has been created for people to read and gain knowledge about every aspect of the book. If your children are watching things that they shouldn't be watching, you should keep your child away from this section. Each person has a different style of book that they enjoy reading, they shouldn't have to lose those books because kids are looking at things they are not meant to. What would be the point in a library if you cannot have certain materials on the side. My take on censorship in libraries should be that these bad sections should be off limits to children. All the libraries are divided into different sections like ; fiction, non-fiction, fantasy, children's books. These sections were created for a reason. If people choose to let their kids read books, that's fine with me. Although parents who don't approve of this can go to a different library. I think if that parent complains and no one else does, they shouldn't be allowed into this library anymore. I don't believe that some documents, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be excluded from a library. Just because a person doesn't appreciate their child picking up a book that they shouldn't have. I think parents should be responsible for what their children watch and not force libraries to remove books from their shelves. Everything from books to movies has been put in libraries for educational reasons. There should be laws that say these things are put in a library for some reason, and if customers don't like it, they can go elsewhere. My own experience as a volunteer at a local library is that there is a lot that has been put into a library for a reason. Every movie, book and magazine has information about something you @ MONTH1 want to know. The books are put in the library for the pleasure and love of reading. All of these types of books are created by people who love to read. Films in a library are set up for educational reasons such as : to teach children to count and to learn something about a certain subject. Magazines could just be in a library for people to read and relax, and learn something new in the world. I really think parents should watch what their kids are reading, you should be thinking the same. Libraries should not have to remove books that have been around for a very long time from their shelves. Documents such as movies, books, magazines, and music should never be removed from a library. What would be the point of having a library if you couldn't get a book, movie, or CD that interests you. After reading it should feel the same, that some things shouldn't be removed from a library because parents don't know how to supervise their children.

Have you ever seen a book or magazine on a shelf that looked offensive ? Say, maybe some kind of book that deals heavily with drugs, alcohol, or even sex? Well, some parents don't want their kids to "accidentally" take this book and read it. It could scare them mentally for life. Offensive books are not intended for children or even some children in their early teens. They are too young to learn about drugs, alcohol and / or sex. If a child picks up a book about sex, which I very much doubt is on a library shelf, what would he say to his parents ? '@ CAPS1, look what I found.' is exactly what the child would say and show the book to his parents. The shocked parent could sue the library for having such an offensive book. However, some @ CAPS2 don't find books like this on library shelves offensive. It might " provide " good information for their life or even someone else's life. @ CAPS2 are those who should read these kinds of books, not their children. It can and will scare them off mentally for life. The library could do simple things, like for example: they could make a room just for @ CAPS2 and have the offending movies / books / magazines in there etc. Children cannot participate unless they have @ NUM1 or higher. It might be a good idea because their kids wouldn't pick up such kind of offensive books and it would keep their minds more secure. We children are always curious about things, especially when we are growing up. We will be asking questions about drugs, alcohol and even sex when the time is right. But for the library to have things like this on their shelves is just very offensive to parents and others @ CAPS2. Library staff should take measurements and create a separate room for @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3

I think censorship is necessary. If all the kids in the world grew up listening to hardcore gangster rap and watching porn @ DATE1, we would have violent and uncompromising leaders tomorrow. It is important that we are somehow held back by these offensive outlets so that we grow into mentally healthy adults. However, censorship can go too far. When it comes to removing an author's work completely from a public library, we've crossed the line. With the @ CAPS2 given to us by our Founding Fathers, our @ CAPS2 given to us at birth, and the duty we have to express our opinion, I submit that it is a crime to take away the hard work of authors and artists from the shelves. Of course, the first argument that comes to my mind to defend my position is the fact that we all have the legal right to express ourselves through the @ NUM1 amendment of our @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2. The editors of this @ CAPS1 were aware that the freedom of creativity should not be denied to people. This law still exists as of DATE1 and has been used repeatedly to defend people arguing that their work, their words and their ideas should remain in the world. As far as I know, removing any form of media, book or entertainment from the general public would be illegal. Yet even with this point raised, some @ MONTH1 are not convinced that we are allowed to say whatever we want. A man by the name of @ PERSON4 comes to mind when asked about censorship in the media. @ PERSON4 was a musician, composer, writer, speaker and human activist @ CAPS2. I think a lot of people think he's a little too wild and deranged to be a compelling argument. @ PERSON4 was known to be an atheist and secular humanist (who believes that there is nothing more important than the physical human body), but he made the same argument that I am giving @ DATE1, and I am a Catholic. @ PERSON4 spoke out against censorship, saying it was a way of judging artists on their work when not even fully listened to. If someone as convincing and passionate as @ PERSON4 could feel this when they didn't even believe in an @ CAPS4, then everyone should see that the human race whether or not they believe in an @ CAPS4 , has the creative right to reveal. In some cases, it is necessary and necessary for people to show their ideas to the public. @ PERSON1, @ PERSON2, @ PERSON3 same, and the list goes on. These people, although from different worlds, different eras and different people, all believed avidly in @ CAPS2 of humans. Imagine if @ CAPS3 just said, "I don't think people want to hear me, so I'm going to stop and let someone else take over for a bit." Do you think the world would be as amazing and integrated as a place ? The point is, we never know how great and life changing someone's perspective can be. Whether it's leading a civil movement @ CAPS2 or trying to bring peace to a world that needs it most, censorship can be the one thing stopping people from seeing the most influential person. that they need. In fact, we are all called to share our ideas. It is our duty to make sure that people see the world not just from their point of view, but from the point of view of a poor homeless man, a single mother of five, a child of five. primary school and a rebellious teenager. The world may not be ready for change, but it needs it. Who is right to judge the work of an artist? Some call it @ CAPS4, some call it man, and some call it government. It's hard to get your work recognized by someone, let alone an entire nation. However, that doesn't mean we just have to give up. Censorship in public places is a crime against the law, nature, and our inalienable @ CAPS2, and it's our job to step out into the world to create a new one.

Censorship is just another way to learn about another person or a company. Wanting to take and hide even the smallest discreet history, political corruption, and inappropriate views from a generation can make them all ignorant and oblivious to their past, present, and possibly future. Censorship is extremely dangerous for a society because it makes it vulnerable in the future. For example, if people tried to censor @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and many other environmentalists around the world for the possibility @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4, then the world might not have a chance to stop or at least slow down the coming disaster. going green. Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline. Also, maybe if more people knew about @ PERSON2's censorship of his oil distribution among @ LOCATION2 (during his presidency), people would at least have discussed impeachment. Try to think about what the future would have been like if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the Holocaust had been censored. It could be considered brainwashing! Even though this @ MONTH1 causes peace and happiness in the world, we still will not know anything about our history, leaving us historically unintelligent. Then think about all the sudden problem it would cause if that information were suddenly found. In @ PERSON1's 'The @ CAPS5' book series, a town has been cut off from its past, which they call 'the @ CAPS6', and they are brainwashed into thinking they almost destroyed the world. by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology. Fortunately, in our time, I don't think we are censored on most things, except of course the politics between other countries. For example, the murder of @ LOCATION1 bin @ CAPS7 was not known to anyone except @ CAPS8 from @ ORGANIZATION1, the military and @ CAPS9. It was also a thoughtful choice of @ CAPS10 instead of announcing it on @ NUM1 news. I of course prefer to be informed about my story, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now. Books like " À @ CAPS11 a @ CAPS12 " or " @ PERSON3 " should never be removed from shelves for young students or the elderly. While it would seem a little more offensive to hear a historic racist Cocasian sing about negroes than a racist book, I would still be interested to hear about it. Censorship itself should certainly be illegal in libraries, @ CAPS13 stores and any other store selling books, music, movies and / or magazines. Although I haven't heard of any recent censorship, but then again, shouldn't I be able to ? It's censorship.

Dear, Katherine Paterson, I was wondering if the things you listed should be offended, well, I think this is a free country and everyone should be treated equally, which I trying to get is that the newspaper organization should continue to do what they are doing! in fact should add more. Yes there should be restrictions on some things, but to resolve the purchase of minors just force people to use their @ CAPS1 ! Doing this I think it would solve a lot of problems, removing everything would be a little too serious for some magazines or movies. So keep doing what you're doing, just put a higher restriction on sales and things should be okay! from your dear, zack

This writing is socially unacceptable! There are many books and media sources out there including: lauguage, sex tones, and other immoral things and ideas. However, culture must be obtained, although immorally on this earth is at an all time high, we must stop focusing on the books that will always be on the shelves and turn our attention to the hearts of the people, and turn to morally right things. When a person walks into a library, @ CAPS8 or she can expect certain things, for example : the smell of older books, the sound of a group of children and the cries of the librarian to silence them .What or she wouldn't expect @ CAPS8: Kids using drugs and watching porn on computers. It is not the fault of a book or the fault of the "evil computers". It's the fault of an immoral world. I myself have witnessed bad things kids do in the school system and it gets worse everyday there is some good but it is definitely not because they care and love what it is. 'they do on this planet. I can cite many in my class @ NUM1 who have told me "The only thing wrong is telling someone they are". This thought process is immoral. But who is going to tell them that, and what is the answer. @ CAPS2 is the answer, in @ CAPS1 it says, @ CAPS2 is the way, the truth and the life. It's the truth. In @ CAPS3's book it is said that @ CAPS4 has surrendered many people to their sinful passions. @ CAPS4 is the only good, and the only light comes from @ CAPS5. The only man to live a perfect life was @ CAPS2 @ CAPS7 and @ CAPS8 was @ CAPS4 in a human body. we as a planet have to look to @ CAPS5, the only good thing. And try to be like @ CAPS5 because this world needs @ CAPS5. Only @ CAPS4 can change a heart. We need to focus on @ CAPS5, once we do that our thinking, writing and acting will change and we don't need to loathe this problem anymore.

I think it's only if there is some really offensive stuff that they should be censored. It is wrong to make fun or joke about people. Make fun of a handicap like there have been films that do. Well actually there's a movie I've seen before called The @ CAPS1 and it's about a guy who laughed at a special olympic team and then lied about his inability to win money. money to run and beat the team in the races when he was totally fine. It would be something that I myself would like to take off the shelves because there is no reason to laugh at a handicap. I wouldn't know who decides what goes on the shelves and what isn't, so maybe according to the offensive information they're being told that something shouldn't be out

I @ CAPS1 '@ CAPS2 believe that all kind of material like books, movies, magazines etc should be censored except mature content like pornography, violent and horrific movies and games video. But that's why we created @ ORGANIZATION1. So when asked, we can show our age. Some age groups react differently to mature content. Usually @ NUM1 and above is a tolerable level for maturity to set in. The maturity is maintained at different rates in all age groups. For example, maybe a @ NUM2 year old is more mature than a @ NUM3 year old. It's when you, as an individual, can act like a human being. Instead of looking like a pack of rabid wolves. Just because you don't act in a mature dosen '@ CAPS2 way means you don't know how to be civilized. The best way to prevent a child from discovering something inappropriate or vulgar is to separate the books by a system of age groups. Keep adult videos off the site and out of the reach of children. Also put security locks on your @ CAPS2.V. to prevent children from sneaking behind your back

Everyone has an opinion. You do not agree ? This is what makes us different, which is why some of us prefer to watch @ CAPS1 over @ CAPS2, or why some want to listen to pop rather than country. A library is a place that brings together all kinds of people. It is a place of interest and information, a place of research and pleasure. So here is my question: "Do we really want to remove certain documents from library shelves just because some people find them offensive." "I don't believe so, as the quote from author, Katherine Paterson says," And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. I agree with this statement! Think about it, if we allowed people to get rid of library books that they don't like, if everyone had that right. We would have no more books, no more material to study or read with pleasure. I have to admit I've seen things that I don't necessarily agree with, but others might. You cannot have a library all to yourself. Something for your interests and no one else. That's not what a library is for, millions of people use libraries for different purposes. So no, I really don't think we should take any items off the shelves. Take only what you find interesting and leave it at that. We all have rights, just as we all have our own likes, dislikes and minds. Opinions define us, choices shape us, but libraries do so much more, they advance our knowledge, make our dreams come true, and sometimes even broaden our horizons. We need books, music, movies, even magazines, but we need them all together. This is my position on this topic, I hope it has helped shape yours.

Books in libraries are accessible to everyone, so whose job it is to decide which ones are appropriate and which are not? It is a very controversial subject. On the one hand, parents worry about what their children have access to in local libraries. They believe that libraries should not contain books that could be deemed offensive. On the other hand, who is responsible for deciding what is offensive and what is not? If people have the right to take away books they think are inappropriate, libraries will end up having so few books that it would be pointless to even get a library card. I believe it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child about morals and what is right and wrong. If kids developed morals and values, parents wouldn't have to worry so much about what they check out from the local library. Children face right and wrong issues every day, and parents need to learn to trust their child is making the right decision. As a teenager, I know people have access to much worse things on the Internet than in libraries. If people start censoring libraries, surely they will start censoring the Internet, and the idea of free speech will be thrown out the window. People have the right to be heard and to share their opinions, and who has the right to say that a person's opinion does not matter? In my opinion, removing books from a library says exactly that. Just a few months ago, I had to write a research article on @ PERSON1, and to find information on the subject I had to consult books in the library. Some of the information I read on the topic was horrific and very offensive, but I couldn't have written my article without it. Books in libraries contain vital information whether the books are offensive or not. Books can be used to teach people what is right and wrong. By being educated on even the most offensive things, people can learn lessons and shape their beliefs. Removing offensive books from libraries will not reduce the risk that someone's child will encounter the information they contain. There are many sources of information, offensive or not, and a library is just one of them. People are responsible for their decisions, and it's everyone's choice about what they choose to read, watch or listen to. We are faced with choices every day. Should we watch a movie even though we know it is inappropriate? Should you listen to a song even if it leaves the wrong message? Checking out a book from the library requires the same decision. Each person must choose what is right, and it is not our job to tell others what they can and cannot do.

Yes, I think any book deemed offensive to anyone should be taken off the shelf. You have to think about it from the other person's point of view or put yourself in their shoes. Suppose you were going to the library and a certain thing was there constantly or you had the impression that it was constantly hanging over your head, that would be a difficult problem to solve during your daily visit to the library. library. Also in your everyday life. One of the reasons for this is that if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you and another person knows it is distressing you, it is highly likely that they will use it against you to say bad things. mean and harsh things. Another reason I think an offensive book should be taken off the shelf is if you were in that location very often. I mean, if you have to see this book every day, don't you think that would start to get on your nerves a bit. So what I'm trying to say is I believe if there's an offensive book on a shelf, take it out. Music shouldn't be as much of a problem as books. Music is something you listen to or hear. Books are things you read. I'm saying music shouldn't be such a big issue because music you don't see as you see it in books. Books usually says it right there in black and white. Also the possibility of being there in front of you in words and images. So what I'm saying here is if you find something offensive, fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of your life. So fix it now or get over anything you find offensive

Books are works of art. Authors are artists. Writing is a form of expression. In @ CAPS1, it grants freedom of expression. I don't think we should deny anyone that freedom. I don't think books or any other art form should be taken off library shelves. I understand that parents don't want their children to see or hear certain things. People want to keep children innocent, they want them to stay innocent. What they need to understand is that children need to grow up. They will be curious. They will want to know. They will want to see the world. You can't hide things from them. I believe in what @ PERSON2 my favorite musician once said "@ CAPS2 covering your children's eyes ..." The world can be a bad place and you want to protect them from it, but it can also be beautiful . There is so much that children and normal people would miss if we deleted everything that someone said was “offensive”. There is also the question of what is offensive? Who's deciding ? Where to draw the line? As Katherine Paterson said, soon we would be out of books on our shelves. Because everyone has a different opinion. People can find the most innocent things offensive. If you don't want your kids to read or hear certain things, tell them. Don't waste it for others. Everyone to his own tastes. Depending on the individual, tastes differ. Something that would be offensive to you could very well be beautiful to someone else. '@ CAPS3 mans trash is another man's treasure.' Books, music, movies are all art. People have the right to express themselves. We censor so much already. I think when you cencor things it takes away the original. If you don't particularly like something, then it's your choice not to read it. It is your choice not to listen to it. You can choose for your children, but you cannot choose for others. People have the right to do whatever they want. People have the right to do what makes them happy. They have the right to read, watch or listen to what makes them happy. They have the right to create what makes them happy. You don't have the right to take this away from someone. Books don't kill people. Music doesn't kill people. They can make you uncomfortable. They may even make you sick or angry, but they don't hurt anyone. People make decisions. People are in control of their own actions. Books, videos, art, don't hurt people. Overall, I don't think any books, music, movies, or any other art form should be taken off the shelves. There might be age limits for certain things, or specific sections for more adult things, but I don't think an @ CAPS3 should have a choice in deciding what's right for someone else. . You can host your children if you wish. You can avoid things that you find offensive. But please don't take one opportunity for another. A wonderful book or a life-changing piece of music might be taken away from someone because you found it " offensive ."

Books are history, no book should be censored. They show us and teach us history. If the book is based on real facts, nothing should be censored. Many books from @ DATE1 and earlier contain words that young children should not yet see. With the way the human race is, everyone is going to hear something wrong or even see something. It's like saying all websites should be cenerosed. A book that needs to be censored must not be in a school @ CAPS1. I would say any book that teaches a lesson or helps a teacher should be used, regardless of content. Therefore, a teacher should read the book before assigning it to the students. If he thinks the students will not behave appropriately, then the book should not be used in the classroom. Many books would be pulled or censored from the shelves. If you don't want to hear those words or see some pictures, you shouldn't have got this book. A lot of people would be driven mad if that happened. I would be two because sometimes an entire chapter could be bad or in music an entire word could be bad. A lot of people are crazy now, but everyone would be crazy if the censorship happened

Removing books from the shelves of our public library ? To me that sounds crazy. I can see how some people can be offended by certain books, music, movies, magazines etc., but some people like it. It's diversity, some people like down to earth literature, but some people can't stand it. Why take away something that only a few people disagree with ? I think some of the best library entertainment is the most offensive, but it's done. I mean, if it's such a problem, there should be some section to find these things. If people want to complain, then they can go out of this section, because people like me will be in this section ready to learn about all these different varieties of entertainment. Whether it is offensive or not. People @ MONTH1 find part offensive, but I think it makes this person stronger. It helps them realize how lucky they are not to be treated in a certain way in the offensive book they are reading. It's just entertainment! If this shocks you and you're not entertained, go find something that does ! Even though I hear about people reading offensive books, I've never really seen one myself. I think some people take offense too easily. This is where you have to reason with them instead of giving in to their demands. What if they aren't taken off the shelves? Like I said, we can create a certain section for that stuff. If they are not happy with the result, they will get over it. Now that you've read what I had to say, what do you think? Do you think we should remove some entertainment from library shelves ? Or should we just reason with people who are offended? Hope what you read today helps keep the books on the shelves and the readers happy !

Should we have censorship in our libraries? This is a question that both sides can argue with with laudable facts. However, censorship is primarily defined as not allowing certain objects or things to be seen or heard until middle age. How do you know when someone is mature? Maturity lies behind you to deal with various thoughts, ideas, actions, etc. Censorship should be allowed to some extent. Censorship plays a big role in today's society. It has changed the content of our television from @ NUM1 years ago to the present day. The government is more forgiving today than it was @ NUM1 years ago. On TV NUM1 years ago, you would never hear a swear word or see a couple sleeping in the same bed. Now some swear words are considered correct because people can handle them. It is as if they are now part of our daily vocabulary. Censorship has changed a lot. Books of all kinds should be allowed for children and adults of all ages. Some publications provide a cornucopia of topics and topics useful to a processing brain. We learn and understand at different rates. Some books with “ adult content ” @ MONTH1 are suitable for smarter minds. Authors sometimes put together what is called "adult content" to add suspense and drama to the whole or the message behind their work. Books help the mind to develop and gain a higher level of learning. Movies are different. Some movies have sexual content that our kids shouldn't be seeing. Most magazines have the same principles as movies. They are both rated differently depending on age levels. Therefore, we can protect their innocence and their youthful comrades. Music is healthy for a person's mood. Music should not be censored. People just have different tastes in music. Some @ MONTH1 like other genres and some @ MONTH1 don't like other genres. There is a wide variety of music that people can enjoy. There is no way to censor the universal language that music provides. Censorship should come down to what the adult allows the child to see and hear. Censorship of books is not acceptable, but censorship of films and magazines is acceptable. Music, however, cannot be censored. The words and sounds speak to a lot of people in strange ways. All of this is useful in the end. Everyone should have the right to watch, read or listen to what they want. It all comes down to learning, and there is no censorship on learning. So please don't censor our libraries. Allow adults to censor what should be censored in their families

I don't think people should cut out books, movies, and music because it's people's choice to read, listen, and watch the stuff that comes with it. Why should people change because others can't handle what's on it. If people want to read, watch or listen to bad things, it is not the choice of others. People will choose what they want or what they think they want to read or watch or listen too. People will find out for themselves what they want to hear or listen to too. Like I said, it's the people who choose what they want to watch, listen to or read and it's not the choice of anyone else to say it. People will find out what they want children to read, listen to and watch, and so will they. That's what I think this essay will be up to people to choose what they want to listen to and hear too.

I think a person has the right to go to a liberay and get a book, magazine, movie and whatever they could because someone could use the information material they need for @ MONTH1. I do think though that this should be handled with maturity, @ CAPS1 kept in a special area or somewhere a child or someone who shouldn't have material on anything unnecessary to them. I think if this is something for an adult only them, there would be no way for a child to get hold of it. A person has the right, I think, to go to the release and get the book they need @ MONTH1 to get personal information to help them find the research paper they need information about . Anything that isn't appropriate should have its own place away from everything else. As I mentioned, I think there should be some protection for the number one kid, who doesn't have to read anything there, and two for someone who doesn't really need this. information to help them get information about something. I think there are a lot of things that can help prevent someone from feeling like freedom needs censorship number one would be to have a special room just for things that are deemed to be out of control by someone. 'a, which brings me to my next point, there should be a worker just to determine in something needs to be kept in a special room. I think there should be a certian age to enter a room for uncensored material. If they don't meet the requirements, don't let them in. I think in some cases then they should have to say why they want this material just to determine that it is for all the right reasons. Like I mentioned, I think everything should be ok because someone might need it for information about a person or a class prompt that needs information. But I also think there should be rules and requirements as to what is distributed and what is not. If this person has a legitimate reason for needing something, I don't see the harm in getting what they need

How would you feel if someone told you that there are certain foods that you can't have in your refrigerator that could be bad for your health or that they might think tastes bad. You wouldn't be too happy about it. Well, it's the same when people want to censor libraries. When people try to censor libraries, they try to remove " offensive " books . If anyone likes these kinds of books and they are taken out. It is unfair to this person because they are limited on what they can get from the libraries. Rather, libraries are a place where you can get books or magazines that you like to enjoy, but they can't because people are trying to censor the books. People who want to censor certain books say they might be offensive not only to them but to children as well. Well, I say to that, you don't have to bring your kids to this section. You don't have to read these books, you can just leave them alone for people who like to read them. For people who want to censor certain books, what makes a book offensive? Who can say if it's offensive or not? The two views are different just because one person thinks their offense doesn't mean another person thinks the same. My opinion is to leave the books there and let people enjoy the books they love to read. No book is bad, every book is good for you because it builds your education, it can also be a stress reliever and something you love to do in your spare time. People who get cheated on books they like because they are criticized. What if the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 series were censored because of magic. To some people this might be an offensive book and if that book was taken off the shelves we would lose one of the biggest books and @ CAPS3 people would be upset. So, in my opinion, everyone should be entitled to whatever books they can choose. For people who don't like certain books just leave them there, you don't like to read them, that's fine. Everyone has a right to these rights, as Katherine Paterson said, “ You have exactly the same right and everyone else too. And then we have no more books on the shelf for one of us' So we should all be able to read what we love to read because the reading is endless

Books should only be removed if they exhibit some degree of offense. Certain other books, however, are intended for educational use and are not intended to offend anyone. Sometimes people take it too seriously. Many books have been an excellent educational resource for many years. Books have been around for a very long time. Many years ago people read books on scrolls, or even pictures to tell stories. Stories have been around for a very long time and are meant to be stories, not works criticized for demeaning others. There are a lot of books, however, that have been meant to demean others. These books, I agree, should be taken off the shelves because they might inspire people to turn on certain races. A good book which shows that he does not put others down but that it looks like it could be " To @ CAPS1 to @ CAPS2 ". This book was designed for people to read and learn about life in the days of slavery or, just after slavery, but where people did not respect the newly liberated men. Another book that tells the story of the days of slavery is " The @ CAPS3 of @ ORGANIZATION1 ". This book tells the story of a young boy who runs away to live his old life and meets a runaway slave named @ PERSON1. Many other books exist like these. But I guarantee that over ninety percentiles of the books are intended for educational use because of the context in which they were used. Most people will take books the wrong way, but that's only because they're afraid of being judged, just as the book was judged by its cover. I have read many books over the past two years and find that many of the books I have read have been instructive for me. There are, however, some books that I agree should be taken off the shelves because they are too offensive. Censorship is on a mission to protect us from many confusing topics and I agree that some books are taken off the shelves. But, I think sometimes places go beyond censorship and should let some people decide which books are suitable for a place, as well as movies. The world is maturing, even as everyone is talking, and people are learning all the time. There should be some censorship in public places, but only on exaggerated topics where the authors have written about an issue that will offend many people.

“We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you have the exact same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. written by Katherine Paterson. If you think about it when you walk into a library, there are a ton of books to choose from. But how much do you think is appropriate for each age and including children, not by many. That's why they have sections for the books, but there are times when people are rude and mix them up on purpose. How many times have you gone to a library and found a misplaced book ? Often times, this can be accidental or intentional. I know if I took my kid (s) to a library and they received a book that was not right for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now, if it was a book that's been misplaced, I'd take it from them. But, yes, there are books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the library. I remember when I was a little girl I would go to the library to check books with my mom or dad it didn't matter they both liked to take me to the library. They were delighted that I like to read but, one day my mother took me to pick up books from the library, she didn't think about looking at the books I had received until we got back to home and she realized that one of my books contained a curse. this. She wasn't happy at all, I had no idea what she was doing. But I understood, she grabbed me by the hand and led me to the car. She tied me up and we left, back to the library. She had no problem walking away and complaining, I can remember her every word she said, it sounded like that. '@ CAPS1, my name is @ LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @ PERSON2, she is six years old. We were barely her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we're back. Well, if you can give me a funny reason why my six year old daughter has a children's book from here with swear words in it. Please speak up and explain that I would love to hear it. The lady at the front desk was amazed that she had never had someone come after her during the seven years she had worked there. But the book is no longer in the library @ LOCATION1, I can't remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can do something. Just as Katherine Paterson said, “ We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you have the exact same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. I can tell you from experience and observation that you can do and get what you want with a little bit of strength and persuasion. This @ MONTH1 is causing trouble, but just make up your own mind and you can help and fix the issues when you think about it.

When you have children, would you like to protect them from something that you think is wrong, even though it is happening in the world around you every day ? Today in society, even though we have free speech, the government has proposed something that even contradicts that, censorship. One thing about censorship is that it's just a way for the government to control what ordinary people say, hear, listen, read, or even see in today's society. We should not be controlled over what we can and cannot read, watch or listen to. I have experienced these things almost daily if not on the radio, it is on television. When someone says something vulgar or inappropriate. The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is, someone is always going to have a problem with it. Just recently in one of my own classes we read an article about a very popular film for children and young adults and a school tried to ban its books from its library because it was about witchcraft. Most of the people I know who have read these books know that witchcraft is not real. Why do people find it necessary to do things like this? I think most people just consider something that could be entertaining for a person to be completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it's a little different, I think it's unique, not bad. The third thing is that it doesn't matter what public libraries shouldn't be censored. Everyone sees it differently, and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and film. Just because someone likes something that someone else @ MONTH1 finds vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove it from the public shelves in the library. After all, the library is public and I really insist that it be public because everyone in the world today is different. Today in society, even though we have free speech, the government has proposed something that even contradicts that, censorship. Starting off on a lighter foot, whether it's purple or green, old or new, someone will always be able to find something wrong. I'm sorry for today's society that they can't realize that the bulk of their problem is trying to control everything everyone else does

Libraries do not have the right in my mind to decide what is offensive and what is not. Libraries should not have the censorship point of view, unlike the people who rent or buy the articles. The @ CAPS1 has an idea of what is offensive, but they shouldn't be able to make that decision. If the @ CAPS1 wants business, he must try to ensure that the customers are satisfied. Libraries should do polls on what everyone wants. Not everyone has the same idea of what a book, magazine, movies, music, etc. is like. offensive. The different opinions of people can vary from a lot to nothing at all. If people think they are so offensive, they should speak to @ CAPS1 and work out a solution instead of getting rid of it. A safe but simple solution would be to create a section reserved for offensive @ CAPS1 or people who claim they are. Another possible solution would be to simply rearrange the areas of the books into main categories such as offensive and no offensive and then break them down into their specific categories. So libraries need to have a survey showing what things people think are bad and the opinions of libraries and then go from there. Surveys can consist of a paper questionnaire that you fill out in @ CAPS1 of its online website. The survey would have a list of books, movies, magazines, and music that people could check off. Now the @ CAPS1 needs the money to keep books and other items in stock and repair them if necessary. So if the @ CAPS1 thinks a book is offensive, they shouldn't have the right to be censored. All these books have been in the library for so long, why change them now. Think about it if that was offensive, why did they put it in @ CAPS1 in the first place. So in conclusion, the @ CAPS1 should have the right to censor books, movies, magazines, music or whatever else they have. It would cost them time and money that they don't have. Customers could eventually stop coming because of the change which would be a waste of money. Now everyone knows that a big loss of money could hurt any business and eventually bankrupt them, or could take weeks, months, or even years to recover and no business wants that. So the easiest way to make sure this doesn't happen is to leave everything as it is.

Books, music, films, magazines, etc. should be removed if they are offensive to a race or any other type of belief, unless they are related to a biological or historical timeline. If the reading material is so offensive to you or your beliefs, you @ MONTH1 want to see a librarian and tell him or her what you think so that the reading material is taken off the shelves and gone. I think if it goes against something the wrong way it should be deleted and gone. I've read a magazine before and there was some offensive stuff. I went to see the librarian, I told her I wanted this magazine taken off the shelves. We argued for about five minutes and finally the magazine was off the shelves. Nobody wants something to go against them anyway. This is how we should have offensive material on the shelves of our libraries.

PARENTS @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 I think some documents should not be displayed. But some books are not too offensive to everyone, so it would be unfair for all books to be taken out of libraries. I can also understand @ CAPS2 by discovering books which are not educational for them. It is also up to parents to show their @ CAPS2 what they have read too much and what they don't read too much. This can also happen with movies, some movies that @ CAPS2 can and cannot watch. The reason I'm saying this is if it was too @ CAPS2 on their own to decide what they would like to do as well, it would usually be negative. That's what parents are for. I was young myself and had experienced this too at some point. The type of movies I watched, I thought they were pretty cool, but I was too young to realize what I was watching and what I was also trying to do from a movie. I had also learned from my parents that the things I did were not rational. Then I realize I was making mistakes. It wasn't cool. friends told me too. So I figured it out the hard way. I don't want @ CAPS2 to experience this. Not every parent can stop all @ CAPS2 from discovering exotic things in books, music, magazines and all. What I'm also trying to say that it can be reduced. Some parents can prevent this from happening. something can go into a brain @ CAPS2 too and that could never be helped or solved. These things are serious and some people don't think it's likely. And that's where it takes effect. It's up to parents or role models to show that certain things are not done for them until the right time is right. I'm not telling parents to trap their @ CAPS2 out of the world. What I am saying is that parents should let them know that they are going to witness certain things. They just need to be ready to see them and hopefully it doesn't impact them negatively. Hopefully they would be smart enough to distinguish right from wrong. It is also up to parents to help their @ CAPS2. It is also the @ CAPS2 who also knows what is good for them. I believe some @ CAPS2 are able to develop from certain events that they learned from the movies, also know they were young, because I grew up myself. And if I can do it, so can they. It is not impossible. A good thing is that some @ CAPS2 grow up in a positive community so as not to read disturbing books / magazines, or watch disturbing movies.

Do I think that some material which is offensive to other people should be removed from libraries ? In my opinion, I say no to this question. I say this because someone else in the library might like some material that offends you. I don't think there are things that are offensive to a person that should be deleted. It can be a pleasure to read to the next person. In the following paragraphs, I will continue to further support my answer. A library is built for the enjoyment of others. If a person finds something offensive to them, I don't think they should get mad because it wasn't put there to hurt you, maybe the person who wrote the book has threw the same as you. Most write books, create music, and produce films to express themselves. They come up with things like that because they might be encouraging someone else. Personally, I have never found a book, song or movie offensive to me. I know the person who wrote the book wasn't talking to me so I don't see why I have the right to get upset and that goes for everyone. Most people who find offensive things in a library always look on the downside. There is always a silver lining to every situation. By having a good positive attitude, you should be looking on the bright side. Most of the magazines you read @ PERCENT1 are about celebrities so it really shouldn't have anything to do with you unless you're so in love with this celebration and just have to say a word about it. Other than that, it's none of your business. Music is a way of expressing yourself in your own way. A person shouldn't be offended because a songwriter wants to express themselves. What if that was the only way for them to express themselves. It's like saying that I don't want them to speak out because it offends me. What if someone doesn't like the way you express yourself and wants you to stop. I'm pretty, you wouldn't like that. In my conclusion, I think nothing should be taken out of the library because it is offensive to someone. Certain things are put there for certain people. No one likes the same. How do I say it, if it offends anyone, well, I wasn't here to offend you on purpose.

Have you ever picked up a book, video or music of yourself and wondered why it's here, it's not a good thing for our young children to read, watch or listen to . I think we should remove these types of books from our shelves in our library to improve our community for our children and their children. We all have the right to express our opinion on things that we believe should and should not be in our library. Books that promote sexual activity, that kill people, use or take drugs and other harmful things which are not the best for our children to read, listen to or watch should be removed from our libaray shelf. Have you ever noticed how much the crime rate and the drug rate have increased over the past few years ? These types of promotions can be found in some of our books, videos and other media. If we remove the videos, books and other media that promote this type of behavior, we would have fewer crimes of this type. I don't believe we would have all of these crimes going on if we took out this kind of media because we all have someone we want to look like in a song or a TV show or even in a book, so we follow what. 'they do, if they encourage crime, you try to act like them. As humans, we follow the actions of others whether we think about it or not. Music also plays a big role in this area, music that contains bad language or encourages someone to do drugs or kill people has been proven to play with our minds. Would you, as a parent, want your child to grow up in a community that promotes sex, drugs, kills people, and other things we shouldn't be doing ? There is music that we all love out there, we listen to what we love so, if we love rap to explain, if it encourages murder, we are more likely to follow that action in the song because your spirit thinks it is beside himself to be a crime to kill because you like rap music so you must be fine. We @ CAPS1 in our community think we should refrain from this kind of behavior and we don't see a lot of drugs, murder or sexual activity. Bilbe teaches us to stay away from things that promote drugs, murder, or sexual activity, so we don't see many of these behaviors in a home or community @ CAPS2. @ CAPS4 is better off than many of us, whether we want to take it or not. They live a life after @ CAPS3, which does not promote all of these behaviors. and I know @ CAPS4 would be more willing to remove this type of media from our library. You can sit for a whole day and watch @ CAPS4's actions and how they are acting. and drugs. Now if you want to help us make our community a better place for your children and their children, let's remove harmful media from our library that promotes sex, drugs and murder. I don't think you'd want to see your kid do drugs or kill people and ruin their life because you didn't help remove that media. Please help us make our community better for our children and their children and the generations to come after us.

Should materials that some people find offensive be removed from libraries ? No, I don't think any documents should be deleted from libraries. A library should have many different types of books, magazines, music, and movies. One of the reasons I think a library should have all kinds of different books is that not everyone likes to read the same thing. Like for example, some children might like to read scary and bloody books and others might like to read sports books or love stories. So maybe kids who read sports books might be offended by all bloody books, but it wouldn't be fair to take them out of the library because some kids like to read bloody books. Another reason why they shouldn't remove from magazines, books, etc., is because different things are fun to read or watch. People would be bored if their library had only war books. Children should learn to read different types of stories. Also, if your library has different types of magazines, kids could learn a lot of interesting facts. You can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine. So if you only had four magazines on the same topic, the kids wouldn't find out any interesting facts. A library is a place where children love to go and enjoy the peace and quiet and watch and read different things. So I think if you started removing specific things from the library, I think the kids would stop coming to the library. A library has great information that kids could learn, but if you start taking things out, few kids will come to the library because they won't learn @ CAPS1 again. So if I had a say in it, I would keep everything in the library. I would not delete @ CAPS1 ! You want people to come to your library, so you don't want to do @ CAPS1 which can jeopardize people who come to your library. I think if you start deleting things less and less people will come in and maybe your library will end up being closed because you don't have any business. So leave everything on the shelves.

There are a lot of things in life and sometimes we need as much help as we can. Sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it. Because when people feel lost, it is the most scraest thing in a person. So they turn to reading books, listening to music, watching movies, as well as researching and reading magazines. But while it's not the best way, you can go there at times when you need to listen to your soul the most. There was a time when we could read or even when we could read loudly. But today, reading takes over. If you can read you can do anything, you could be the one to run around the world someday if you read it right. Books and magazines aren't much different between the two. Books can make you forget about places you 've never seen before and places like nature, @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS1 and high and trees. He teaches you @ LOCATION1 thing but not everything he teaches is good. Books can lie about what's going to happen to the world. Now magazing shows you what all the starts do and how to live there and what the house looks like and the money they start at home. There is one thing you need to understand, you can't always crack and what you read is right, you have to read your mind, see what it says about what you just read. When you hear your favorite song, what do you do or when you see your favorite movie ? Start dancing or do you cry when they break up, tell yourself I can sing like her or do you hold back the part in the movie. These things can help you or make you think of things that you shouldn't do to people or even to yourself. Music can make you think about what your life has been like or miss the deceased because they listened to this song so much. Music can make you kill yourself, drive you crazy, hurt your soul when you hear what someone else has thrown. It all depends on how you take the song when you first listen to it and take the messages out of it. Movies show the story and show that you want to happen to people when they do the wrong things which will happen to them. There might be an ican in the movie you're watching and might want to be like it. But not everyone you see should want to be like them. You have to be yourself at the end of the day. Because you wake up looking at yourself everyday and love every day and take care of yourself every day. When all is said and done, you have to believe in yourself and not listen to what everyone else is trying on you. Go with your soul. Yes, listen to it, read it or even watch it, but just remember your urges and do what you love. So that's what I think about music, books, movies and magazing, listen but don't listen at the same time

I think films and magazines should be off limits to children in the library. There are many reasons why these things should be censored and in this article I will explain why they should be censored. I will also give some examples of things that should not be possible for children. The main reason why movies should be censored is that movies rated @ CAPS1 are not only meant to be rented by children, but it is wrong to rent those movies to them. I mean, if there's a sex scene or something like that and you're only eight years old, it would be awkward for parents to explain what the actors do. I mean, if you were a parent, would you like to explain to your eight year old what sex is. The next thing I think should be censored in the library is magazines. I know three in particular by heart, and they are @ CAPS2, @ CAPS3 and @ ORGANIZATION1. These three magazines talk about how to be better in bed. I really don't like just any child, teens included should know how to be better in bed. They also have several unhealthy diets that teens could try. This could make them very sick and if they are already skinny, they could eventually die. Well that pretty much sums up what I think about library content censorship. I don't really think there are many books that are so bad for children's ears and eyes. I mean there are romances but I don't think a kid is going to last a whole romance, because they're pretty boring. Well, hopefully that will stop libraries from letting kids get their hands on this kind of content.

In the libraries there are books, music, magazines which are not very suitable to put on the shelves. There are little kids out there who will want to watch whatever they can get their hands on. They are very mysterious when it comes to this. There are bad books, but there are also good books in the library. If people find a book or any type of material in the library and find it offensive, then they should remove it from the shelf. There are children who watch whatever they want or what they find interesting. The library should also at least check what the book is about when it arrives at the library. This way, no one would have to worry about a material being offensive. Movies shouldn't really matter because there are a lot of bad movies but I don't think people would find them offensive. They don't have to watch it and neither do their children. There is a lot of bad music. I think there should be censorship on music because some music today is about drugs, alcohol and violence. People wouldn't want to see this in their local library for their kids to see. I have seen people on the news get upset when they see something they think is inappropriate for underage children. I would also get angry because I don't want an underage child to listen to this type of music. Children now admire these songwriters and want to be them. This is not a good thing at all. All magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who is the person on the cover. Libraries would not put an inappropriate magazine on the shelves. There are a few magazines that they have but they are good magazines even for kids to read. I think libraries don't publish offensive magazines because they don't want controversy. People today have released even more great magazines to read that are not inappropriate for anyone. I think some people today don't realize that the library would want to offend anyone by putting out these offensive magazines, movies, books, and music. Putting censorship on these things would be a good thing because there are materials that are not good for small children to read, hear or watch. Parents don't want their children to admire someone involved in violence, drugs or alcohol. Censorship would be one way of applying all these documents just to keep controversy and the safety of children away.

Censorship can be seen as a major problem. I believe it is our right to read and publish whatever we want. It shouldn't be another person's opinion that affects what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch. Finally, censorship is a popular communist trend. Therefore, I think the censorship is bad. First of all, we have the right to say, read, write and watch whatever we want, as long as it is not about slandering someone. I do not believe that this slanderous problem is the cause of the censorship of many books today. Thus, in all other cases, the censorship would be wrong and immoral. Second, it shouldn't be someone else's opinion that determines whether something is censored. My opinion @ MONTH1 is different from that of another person and their opinion @ MONTH1 is very different from that of someone else. If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves. Others @ MONTH1 find the book, movie or magazine great and very informative or interesting. Finally, censorship is a communist trend. The last time I checked, the @ LOCATION1 is a democracy. So that would be going back on our fundamental principles of government to censor anything that is not prejudicial or slanderous towards a person or a race. So censorship should not be allowed anywhere. It's a very communist thing to do. It violates our rights. Finally, opinions vary among people on what should and shouldn't be censored, making it impossible to know what should and shouldn't be censored.

Throughout history, they have always been the ones who refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether it was in @ LOCATION1 when the statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the church @ CAPS1 or by mass burning books to preserve ideals that could be invalidated by the plain text. However, it is not the @ DATE1, women are no longer looked down upon, science is not disparaged and ideas are free all over the world with the Internet. So, is it the libraries' fault for providing uncensored content or the fault of parents for not educating their children about the morality of such articles? The modern library has very specific demographics for all of the items it owns. The movies on @ CAPS2 appeal to both parents and teens, the music appeal to teens, and the books and the previous two media sources appeal to younger people. So how fair would it be to force a library to censor two of the things that make it the most money just so kids don't read, watch, or hear them. In addition, libraries generally do not allow young children to view movies rated @ CAPS3 or parental advisory @ CAPS4. Some people argue, however, that books are the most dangerous thing for children and young adults. How books can lift ideas and reinforce them in the minds of teenagers over the course of @ NUM1 pages until parents end up with an antisematic teenager with a poor view of racism. So why would it be the library's fault, because they only provided one book that shouldn't have affected this teenager so much, if this teenager had had strong moral beliefs instilled by his parents. So if you find offensive material in a library or are worried about your child going there, there is always an easy fix. Do not go to their homes and don't let your child go to their homes. However, if you see the beauty in the impurity that a library brings to a community and to a person like I do, do not allow injustice to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors and others. yourself to happen.

Every time we go there is censorship. Children hear their parents say them and are more than likely to repeat them. Children should know what the curse is and know that it is wrong to do so. Children should read what they read. Books should be censored if they are made for children. Adults should be able to read any type of book they want. Children who have been isolated should learn that swearing is also a fact of life. We can learn something from everything we read. There are a lot of facts that teachers don't teach that books can. When uncensored things are said out loud, children are immobilized. If they read for themselves, they would learn a lot more. If your parents don't let you know either, you may be missing out on some of life's most important facts. It is very unnecessary to have rated the @ CAPS1 movies. Parents should be able to watch an adult movie with their children without being on the lookout for something that they don't want their child to see. The choice of which kids to watch censorship movies should definitely be up to parents. I still think it's a bad idea to have derogatory images in magazines. These @ MONTH1 photos give children negative thoughts, such as insecurity of wishing they were prettier than the model. Children remember almost everything they hear / see. Children should read what they read.

'@ CAPS1 day @ CAPS4 @ CAPS3, my father was arrested three times for @ CAPS2 : @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5.' @ CAPS6 is just @ CAPS1 of several quotes from a book I'm reading that some people might take offense to. The book in general is a pretty calming book, it's just things that people might take offense to. That's not to say the book shouldn't have its place on the shelves. I don't think libraries should be forced to take books off the shelves just because they have offended someone. It's like saying you should shoot everyone who made an offensive comment to someone in their life, you would have nothing left in the end. If someone finds the things other people have to say offensive, they usually stop hanging out with that person. Therefore, it would make sense for someone to stop reading a book if they find it offensive. Some magazines have some really shocking stuff that people are saying in the real world. It's not like your generic non-fiction books that have insulting things to say, at the high school level. You don't need to subscribe to that particular magazine, or even pick it up to read it. So many things offend so many people these days, in so many different ways. What might offend @ PERSON1 down the street, @ PERSON2 across town might find it funny. 'wants and needs. I think it would be fair to put a restriction on the books, on the age limits. Some of the more offensive might have higher age limits. At the college I attended, they have books classified as "young adult" books meaning you either need to be in eighth grade or have a note from your tutor that you can read these type of books. It would be like in the cinema ; movies have ratings so only certain people can watch them, why can't they do the same with books ? Guess what I'm trying to say is that it would be very disappointing for me and a lot of other people if you started to put books, @ CAPS7, movies, magazines etc on the shelves and off the market just because someone cried out against him. If they don't like the material they watch, read, watch, listen to, or all of the above, no @ CAPS1 requires them to pay attention. They can go and read the nursery rhymes because the nursery rhymes are not offensive. Again, I'm saying taking a book off the shelf every time someone complains about the material would be like shooting every person who has ever made an offensive comment to someone in their lifetime, it doesn't. you would have nothing left.

Remove books from the shelves? I do not think so. When you go to the library, what kind of books are you looking for? I love mysteries and scary books, yet they keep me on the edge of my seat; some I have read @ MONTH1 are not suitable for children younger than me. People say they want to remove books, music, and movies from the library when they are deemed offensive, but I think that's a bad idea. People don't always read books or watch movies because it is their choice. You can find a lot of young children in the library these days for school purposes. In my own experience, I had to get a movie from the library once for a project. It was about the civil war. There were some disturbing scenes in the movie, but I had to watch it for school. If it hadn't been in the library, what would I have done? This is one of the reasons I don't think taking books and movies off the shelves would be a good idea. Like I said at the start, I love detective stories. Some mystery books contain parts that @ MONTH1 are offensive. The book I'm reading now is about the murder of a young girl. I think it would be an offensive book to someone young, or someone whose loved one has been murdered, but that doesn't mean I think they should remove it from the library. If they took books like that, what would the people who love them do? It doesn't seem fair to me. For people who find offensive books, movies, music, or magazines in the library, just don't use them. The library is a place where you can find almost anything that interests you. So let's keep everyone in mind and their different interests. It is also a place where one can find a lot of information although it can be offensive. It would not be fair or just to remove books from the library

In my opinion, censorship of any kind should not exist, especially in libraries. Libraries are the place where anyone can view a book, @ CAPS1, magazine or movie. This is where the poor can access the same materials as the better-off. If you remove opinions from books, music, movies, or magazine / newspaper articles, you are removing the author's right to free speech just because someone has found it to be offensive. The right to free speech is important in @ LOCATION1, we can have opinions here, we can choose our beliefs, and if anyone wants to share their beliefs and opinions in writing then they should be allowed. Writing is a form of expression, writers can express their thoughts, use their imaginations to create fantastic worlds and unique characters. Who do you think they are to say this is offensive ? Who decides that this movie book is offensive? If we took away books that a person found “ offensive ”, we wouldn't have anything to read. Some people @ MONTH1 find @ CAPS2 offensive, but we still put it in libraries, some people @ MONTH1 find books on witchcraft and vampires offensive, but these are all the rage now, we would not take them down. Things that people find offensive are just opinions, just like those of writers. It just wouldn't work - if you want young people to read you have to give them something to read that will stimulate their interests, and sometimes @ MONTH1 will be “offensive”.

There are many different types of books in the library. Not all are for everyone's eyes. I think libraries should censor books, movies, and magazines so that they're either in a certain room where only adults can see or get them, or they're not in the library at all. Books in libraries can have some very obsessed items that young children shouldn't be able to see. I have been to the library many times, either alone or with others. I know what is out there and some books or movies are not always rated by kids. I wish I could one day take my own child to the library knowing that what he is going to see is good for his eyes. Magazines are always about new relationships or this person is having a baby or whatever, and I don't want my kid to see that. The library I usually go to has the magazines where everyone can see them and I don't want that for my young son or daughter. I think a parent should be able to take their kids to a library knowing that when their kid runs to them with a book it will be something they can read or get out loud and not something an adult read . Libraries could always make a separate room for books and movies that are not always for children. Such as movies or books rated @ CAPS1 which are not suitable for young children. That way, when a little kid is running around looking for a new book to read, he can't see or pick up those books or movies. I don't know about other adults or parents, but I sure don't want my little kid walking around talking about some inappropriate book or movie he saw in the library. Since libraries offer many types of magazines, books, and movies, this isn't always a safe place to let your child roam. Libraries could always make a separate room for items like this. For books intended for alumni @ ORGANIZATION1, films classified @ CAPS1 or magazines such as @ ORGANIZATION1. I think if libraries did this parents would be much more comfortable taking their kids and letting them run around and look for new and interesting books to read or movies to watch.

There are many reasons why censorship can be seen as a good thing or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because there is something you don't like that you should watch it or use it doesn't. There are a lot of people out there who would love to have access to this information or entertainment. Another reason is that if there is something that someone does not want their child to look at, then they must either believe that their child will not look at them or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone took away something that offended them? There would be nothing left to read, listen to or watch. First, why I think censorship is bad is that people who take offense at what they want to remove don't have to look at what is offensive. No one is forcing them to watch it or use it. They better ignore it. Because others, who take no offense, have the right to watch it or use it. The library might be the only place where someone can access this kind of material. So if someone were to remove this material, the person who needs or wants it, would not have access to use it. And they have the right to use it. Their child might even be entitled to it. Second, some people would not want their child to see these things. But removing it shouldn't be a person's first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at him. And if they can't, they have to somehow prevent their child from seeing it ; not by deleting it. The parent should be able to find a reasonable way to prevent their child from looking at things that they don't want the child to look at, rather than taking that thing away from the child and the whole community. Finally, let's say that in a library, there is at least one book for every person in a community that offends that person. If they each had the right to take away the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people who took a book away would most likely appreciate another book that someone found offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because not everyone liked books that they didn't find offensive. Once someone starts deleting, other people will join in and you will end up with an empty library. That's what I think of censorship. This is really wrong. Personally, I wish I could go to my library and choose a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why could anyone else take this away from them

Have you ever read or listened to something so disturbing that you wonder how it even got published? Well, music, books and magazines these days are full of garbage and inappropriate thoughts that children listen to and base their lives on. All of those resources that children can find that contain this kind of material can be found in libraries. We need to end it or find a source of censorship for these library resources. A library tends to be viewed as a boring or very simple place. If a child at school walks down the hall saying that he has found a very good book, other children are interested; they find out it contains drugs and they assume it's not a boring book like any other you might find in a library. Then more and more people get this book and other books which have this style of material are discovered and checked. Now all these kids with these popular books consider themselves “ cool ”. So these kids start to do actions and start to behave the same way as the characters in the book. It leads to disaster. Music can be the same way. Music that has been recorded over the past ten years incorporates sexual references, drug use and inappropriate behavior into its lyrics. Why would anyone want to put this kind of material in this masterpiece ? Well, singers and writers have found that songs containing these topics sold out more often. Thus, each artist, whatever his work, puts these references in his books or his songs. Now the singers are starting to make music videos that don't sing those lyrics but show them too. Children see these artists in these videos with attractive friends, lots of money, and living the "perfect life." So this person is trying to do the same thing this artist did to make their life more like this. The movies are coming in then, the movies have seen the ratings go up on those kinds of styles, so they start to put them in the movie. Now, all of these parts contain this garbage and have had it for some time. How to get it out? How do we ensure that our children stop having access to these resources ? No parent wants to walk around and hear children say these things or do these actions. So libraries need to have some censorship over their work; this job should be deleted so that minors do not get the wrong message. What happened in the good old days when music, movies, and art were a special talent and not seen as something to get our kids in trouble? We need to end this censorship in libraries and get back to the good old days before things get more out of hand than they already are.

I was asked the question " Do you believe that a certain material, such as books, music, movies or magazines, etc." " Should be removed from shelves if they are deemed offensive ? " I should say not. I don't think you should be in the library to criticize what other people believe. Don't mind it. I don't think people have enough time to worry about what other people think, even though people do it all the time. The next time you see a book that offends you, walk away from it and don't bother looking at it. Anything can be offensive to anyone, @ PERSON2 was absolutely right when she said '... If I have the right to take this book off the shelf ... You have the exact same right and all the world too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. I think all kids these days know more than they should anyway, so why censor what they already know ? What if you could like this specific series and it's about haloucaust and it's like a lot of different stories in one to tell how @ CAPS1 stayed in the camps, but you're not @ CAPS2 or @ CAPS3, and an @ CAPS2 occurs reading it and removing it from the shelves because it is offensive. Maybe he thought it was a shame and lies about his home country and that it makes people think that they are all like @ CAPS5. If this had happened to you, what would you do ? Would you go looking for a new book? Or would you be upset because you couldn't complete the whole series? A lot of people have offensive things every day that they shouldn't. People try to act like they're better than everyone else, and that's not fair. If you are the type to find things in books, movies, music, or magazines to be offensive, then you need to get over yourself and realize that you need to spend more time living your life rather than yourself. get upset over stupid things. In music there are certain words used that one would like to be called, but if another race decided to sing about it as well, then they might get mad and think they are racist. It is not about being aggressive, offensive or directed at you ! So do everyone a favor and stop complaining. Now Katherine Paterson, @ CAPS6 if you have a problem with your child or any other child picking up a book from a shelf even though it might offend some, I think you must realize that it is a good thing that this child is always trying to read and try to read better while reading. There are some selected magazines and movies on the shelves of public libraries and stores that might offend others, but if it offends you, why are you looking or even going to buy / check it out ? Personally, I don't think a book should be taken off the shelves of a library anywhere. removing books from shelves is like telling people to stop reading

They have a book in the library called '@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3' if you ever read @ CAPS3 you might cry. When they have @ CAPS3 in the basement, they make him eat on the floor, eat his brothers and even eat hot. they beet and then he has boos all over his body his dad broke his arm in half his dad and mom got into so much fight his brothers can't type @ CAPS3 anymore so his brother called the cops and them cops came and we were all gone. two years later he and his brother were adopted there, the new mom and dad were good too, even though they had six brothers and five sisters, but it all lasted a long time and they had a good life afterwards the death of mom and dad

When someone goes to the library there are several things to choose from. There are books, music, movies, magazines, etc. But all of this is not necessarily a good thing. There are several books, movies, and music albums that may be offensive or inappropriate to library audiences. Material that is offensive should not be on the shelves for the sake of children. While there are many good items in a library, there are also bad or offensive items in a library. For example, an explicit music album. If an explicit music album is right on the shelf of a library, then anyone can listen to it or take it out for a while. By removing bad music, it keeps young children away from the explicit music that most parents don't want kids to listen to anyway. Movies are also a problem in libraries. For example, the library has movies rated @ CAPS1 on the shelves for anyone to take out to watch. Most movies rated @ CAPS1 contain something that makes them unsuitable for children. Movies rated @ CAPS1 are rated because of all of the content in the movie. This is why, when these films are shown on television, they are edited for all audiences to watch. So by removing these types of films from library shelves, it keeps young children away from inappropriate behavior. Books are the same as movies and music. There are books on the shelves that some people consider to be " funny ", but in reality it is a harmful book. There are books that contain racial material, even disparaging statements. By removing these types of books from library shelves, many more people would not be made aware of all of the racial comments that are occurring. For the sake of children and young children, any material found to be offensive in libraries should be removed. If the library simply removed all the bad material, it would make all the libraries a healthier and more stable environment to study as it was used before. Take out all the offensive material, then they could put in more educational books, movies, etc.

What is offensive about libraries ? Library offenses are inappropriate and uncensored books, music, magazines, films and other material. These books and other things in these libraries should not be taken off the shelves. They should not be deleted because the authors of the books are only writing. From my own experience, I have seen inappropriate films. For me, I feel like they are teaching me lessons, but it also depends on what kind of movie it is. If it's rated @ CAPS1, I know @ MONTH1 sees blood, gory scenes, and nudity. If that kind of movie isn't @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, then I know some of these things on the @ MONTH1 screen are happening in real life. Most @ MONTH1 doesn't happen, but there's a good chance it will happen to someone in the world. All of this teaches me to pay more attention to what I do and where I do it. In libraries there shouldn't be any nudity websites, books or magazines or anything like that because it's just stupid and inappropriate for any child to see, especially in a public library. Now, if it's a bloody book or a book with a lot of blood, then it should stay on the shelves. I honestly say it shows and maybe teaches others not to do the same. So, as I ask again, what can @ MONTH1 be offensive in libraries ? Some @ MONTH1 say that books, magazines, movies, etc. containing racist slurs are offensive ; but for others, it shows how cruel and horrible the world can be. From my perspective, I just feel like the authors of these books are just writing and letting creativity take over. Whether @ MONTH1 is, it is not @ MONTH1. In so many words, I say that books, magazines, music, movies and other “ offensive ” material should stay on the shelves. For so many reasons I said, and the reasons I didn't, they help people learn.

Should libraries pay more attention to what they disseminate in their location? Of course they should. Libraries have all kinds of people coming in and going out every day. Some classified documents need to be placed in certain places for certain people. The library should be more strict about the material that people in the library consult on a daily basis. Libraries need to become a little more organized. Libraries have people coming in and out of the library every day. People of all ages and everyone are welcome at the library. That being said, kids of all ages come to the library all the time and choose all kinds of materials. Children, of course, cannot read everything in the library. They should remain in their selection of appropriate classified materials. So if the library is more censored and strict on material, kids can't get their hands on material that they shouldn't be seeing at this point in their lives. You would want your seven year old to see inappropriate or offensive material, right. Libraries should put material that adults only see in a completely different section than they would like children who come to the library to see. In doing so, it decreases the chances that children will have access to the material they should see. Additionally, some books that the library thinks certain children should be able to see might be offensive to another group of people and may not want their children to see them. So the @ MONTH1 books show racism, or maybe some other kind of discrimination and it is not the purpose of the book to make this @ MONTH1 suggestion but it is still in the book and in the wrong hands it can be a very bad thing especially in some children's minds. Libraries really need to stop and think for a second whether this book is truly appropriate for this age group or even for this institution. Libraries have become places where children consult books on their own and for me that is a problem. I think kids need their parents' concentration to get a book out of a library, but libraries care, no. The @ MONTH1 library checks their inventory and notices that an @ MONTH1 book is missing, but guess what, by then it is already too late. Kids these days can just walk out with books and know they will even think they just picked up a book without checking it. When kids find a document in a library and they know they aren't supposed to have it and they know they can't walk out of the library with it, they may decide to just take the book. Security will not think twice to check the child and what the result is the child's mind is corrupted. Guess what you can blame on the library. Isn't that something the kid got from your friendly neighborhood library. Organization is the key. Libraries need to organize their material better, in a flat and simple way. It really isn't that difficult. They should review the content they put on the shelves of their establishment. I have the impression that people at the library are lazy personally. If they just tried a little harder, maybe the kids wouldn't get their hands on materials they don't have to get. Just pay attention to what's going on in the library. There are books everywhere, aren't there. They are children, correct. Children @ MONTH1 are in the appropriate section of the library, but maybe a book from the adult section of the library fell there by accident. Although it was an accident, it still happened and it can be avoided and should be avoided for the sake of the children. All we need is a little more organization. As you can see in the following libraries, we don't talk about our children as much as we do. It is good that everyone is welcome in the library with no questions asked, but people should stay at the designated place in the library. Children should not be allowed in the adult section for safety. Also, a book on the adult side should not be in the children's section as anything can happen and corruption will increase. We need more stringent libraries. Better security on what children are looking at and where the equipment is located. Also, the library really needs to review the material and decide if it is appropriate for all readers that @ MONTH1 is reviewing the material. Organization is the key to all of our worries, if we try a little harder it won't be a problem.

Pornography, vulgar language, grotesque scenes and much more make books and movies inappropriate for some. In a culture like the one we have @ DATE1, censorship usually takes a back seat. The media constantly presents sensual elements and the language is bad too. People have always had the right to see what they want and to read what they want because of the freedom that this country offers. Everyone has their own opinion, but there should be no censorship in libraries. There are a lot of things in the @ DATE1 libraries that show bad images and contain questionable content. Books and movies contain things that children shouldn't see, but the library cannot remove them. People love to see and hear these things, which is why @ CAPS1 comes out with more @ CAPS2 rated movies than all other ratings combined. They get the most money out of it. In the economy of @ DATE1, the library needs to keep these items on their shelves so they can stay active. If people are offended by this, stay away from that area and don't pick up the book or movie. If someone decides to take down a book or movie that they consider offensive, they are breaking the freedom they have. Censorship is an opinion-based topic that cannot be done alone. As we can see, the censorship of books and films is not entitled to a personal opinion. It is the library's duty to preserve people's freedoms and provide them with the entertainment they want. Books and movies with adult content can also provide insight into what a company shouldn't look like. Parents have to change what their children watch, but as adults they can watch or read whatever they want.

Hey, my name is @ PERSON1 and I have things to say that people need to hear. I think libraries are good for people of all ages, but there are books in the library that are not made for children to read or see. They should at least put them in a separate part of the library. I had an experience like this once. I was about to leave for the library when my little brother asked me if he could come with me. I didn't want to take her away but I couldn't say no to her. He put on his shoes and he ran for the door, he was so excited. We stopped at the library and he started running for the doors. I chased him, when I caught him I told him he couldn't run away from me like that. We walked inside, it was a giant library. He went to get a book to look at and I went to get a good book to read. I found one that looked very interesting, got it and started reading it. Then @ CAPS1 ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at, so I went with him to go check out the book. He gave it to me and I just lost it, the book was not a children's book at all. I was one of the worst books I have ever seen, we left the library and never came back. I think books that are bad for kids should be in their own section in the library. This section should be for adults only and no children are aloud in it. This is what I think should be done at all libraries

Censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years. In many school libraries, some books, music, movies, and magazines have been deleted because of their content. These elements can be removed for these common types of content, including the use of violence, sexual acts, drug use, and inappropriate language. Many parents of young children still wonder what their children are doing in school. Most parents would not want to find out that their children are introduced to such things at a young age, as this might influence them to participate in these activities. In my opinion, I think that some material in school libraries should be removed, but not in public libraries, because a public library can be divided into sections based on age groups. In elementary and secondary school libraries, articles should be censored as young students do not need to be introduced to inappropriate or violent things in any way. In a school environment, children should only be introduced to drug use and sexual activity through some sort of health class, as this is where they will learn the real facts and what they do. would be more educational for them, rather than hearing about drugs, sex and violence in a song or seeing some form of it in a movie. Many children watch movies that contain very violent and inappropriate scenes, and some of the songs in the world today are quite inappropriate for young children. There are also many books and magazines that should not be read by young students in school due to their content, which is why I think censorship in libraries is a good thing.

WE ALL THINK OF NOTHING WHEN YOUR KIDS CHECK BOOKS IN LIBRARIES. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE DON'T WANT YOUR KIDS TO EXPECT CENSORSHIP OF BAD BOOK, MOVIE, MUSIC OR MAGAZINES. A PARENT DOESN'T WANT TO COME HOME A CHILD TO LEARN A NEW WORD FROM THE NEW BOOK OR MOVIE THAT SHE / SHE JUST CHECKED AT THE LIBRARY, OR BY READING A LIBRARY MAGAZINE. IT COULD CHANGE THE ATTITUDE OF YOUR CHILDREN, PUT A BAD INFLUENCE ON YOUR CHILD DUE TO A TRIP TO THE LIBRARY. SO FOR CHILDREN THERE MUST HAVE A SECTION THEY CAN BOOK IN THERE AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO VIEW THE CENSORSHIP BOOK. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE MORE CONVINCED ON THIS SUBJECT.

I believe that censoring books in a library can be both good and bad. I think there are different levels of censorship that should be applied depending on the library in which the censorship is required. In elementary school libraries, I think it would be appropriate to censor books that are purchased and used in the library. Seeing that elementary school children are not as mature as an adult or a high school student, their reading level is not as advanced as ours. Parents certainly wouldn't want their children to read books that contain sex, drugs, and violence. This is because reading these books might give them ideas. It @ MOIS1 teaches them things they are not supposed to do, and they @ MOIS1 think it's okay to act on what they learn from a book. On the other hand, high school students like me are interested in these kinds of books. I'm mature enough to know how not to mess with what I read, and I'm already aware of most of the things in the books. While most guys enjoy violent shooting books or soccer books, a lot of girls are interested in the type of romantic books, which maybe express more than most kids should know. In high schools there should be less censorship due to the fact that we are more mature and should be able to read what interests us. In public libraries, I think there should be sections of books based on age level, which most libraries already have. This way, parents who take their children to the library will know which way to orient them. Everyone is forced to make their own choices, whether that choice is to read books that are more likely to be offensive is their choice. Overall, I don't think books should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive because books are kind of an outlet left for people. They can be educational, read for entertainment, or just read to keep you occupied. Books are everywhere and people have every right to read whatever they want. On the other hand, I think it's a great idea to censor books and categorize them to reduce the chances of young children stumbling across books they aren't supposed to read and so that all of their parents are happy !

I think everyone has their own opinion of what they listen to, what they watch and what they read. I believe that some things can change outside of the world. no offense to people or not because there wouldn't be any more to sell if people had points there for being offensive because everything is offensive at least one person would be. I think they have to get rid of the things that cause weak-minded people to do it if they see it and have it in mind and they are going to do it in real life by getting rid of the things that can cause trouble for the weak mind. I think all we can change is what we see or hear and change the world, and that's what the world needs to change about what we couldn't think of before.

I think censorship should be allowed in high school. On the one hand, students who read books or watch censored films can learn a lot. Also, I think if the books are bad and not suitable for school, why are they here ? I think movies that are not allowed because of their rating sucks because they may contain pictures of naked people and bad language, but we are high school kids and we should be able to watch them because they are educational and we are pretty mature to watch them. Nonetheless, I think censorship is a good thing and a bad thing, but overall I think it should be allowed. Therefore, books or movies that are censored should not be censored because I personally think students learn better from recent movies rated r than some @ DATE1 movies which are black and white. Children pay more attention to good, interesting movies and old movies, most students fall asleep or just don't pay attention. So after that, I think censorship should be allowed in high schools. If books and movies are so bad then why would they already have them here. I think it's stupid for teachers or administrators to think we're too immature to watch rated movies like all kids in school watch at home I think. Yeah, I know some movies show scenes that aren't school related, but whatever, we'll get over it. Overall, I think censorship should be allowed in high schools. Well the last point is that this all helps us in some way if you really think about it. Get a classroom with computers and for a week let them listen to music while they work and for another week don't let them listen to anything other than seeing what comes out best. Personally, listening to music allows me to concentrate better and allows me to remain rude in doing my job. So I think censorship should be allowed in high schools. So you got my opinion on censorship and I hope it helped you see this situation better. I think r rated movies should be allowed in high schools and all music should, I mean, it's not like we're in jail, is it ? So there you have my opinion that censorship should be allowed in high schools

Should we censor libraries? Some say there should be, some don't. Cultural books and magazines might be offensive to some readers. The story in the books can even be offensive sometimes depending on someone's lifestyle or background. Are you wrong if you say you want censorship in the library? No, you are not wrong because there are a lot of people who think that certain books should be taken off the shelves of local libraries. Some of these reasons are because parents might have young children and they don't want to expose them to such things while they are young and vulnerable. Others, however, say that censorship is unnecessary because people go to the library and search for a book at their own risk. This means that if someone goes to the library looking for a certain book and chooses one that they find offensive, it might be a good book for someone else. Must all books considered "offensive" be fiction? No, not all books have to be fiction if they are offensive. That's not to say that there aren't any books like that. Cultural books or magazines from other countries or on a certain subject can sometimes be very graphic and have language that is only appropriate for certain ages. All over @ CAPS1, no matter where you are, there will be things that you might find interesting or offensive to you. Everyone has their own opinion on the matter. The cultural @ CAPS3s in the library only show how people from other countries live and act. These are not opinions or false claims in these @ CAPS3, only a fact. So cultural @ CAPS3 should not be censored, although there may be a section just for this type of material. History books can be one of those @ CAPS3 that really depends on your opinion or what you were raised to be. The religion is something that history books can really offend because they might have some facts wrong on this type of religion. Some people would be very upset that it was wrong because they teach children religion badly. Race and origin is another issue for some people. History books and Elders' stories can still get mixed up and could cause problems. For example, if a @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ NUM1 veteran told a story about what happened in a certain area ; the story book might tell a completely different story. History books shouldn't be censored because they are facts and they teach children about what happened in the past and how people survived. My take on library censorship is that there shouldn't be. Perhaps the library could create a section on what people might consider “ offensive ”. @ CAPS3 or books should definitely not be taken off the shelves, as one man's offense is another man's big reading

Today millions of adolescents are bombarded with all kinds of media garbage. This can range from exposure to certain movies, music, magazines, books, or even advertisements. Parents, teachers, and even governments censor documents like these to protect students or the general population on matters that may be offensive or difficult to explain. But is it really the right choice? In life, we cannot close our eyes and pretend that there are no hard concepts in the world that we have to face. In fact, our parents and teachers should prepare us to be fully equipped when we go out on our own to find our place in the world. This then begs the question, is it okay to censor certain books from the shelves of a library that can potentially enlighten us as growing students ? When a person conceals information, that person steals the right to know. Not only that, but what one person finds offensive another cannot @ MONTH1. This subject is simply too abstract to regulate. For example, take what Katherine Paterson said about the fact that if everyone decided to work this way, all of the books in the world would not be available to any of us. Therefore, censorship in libraries should be condemned because we only hurt ourselves in the long run when we limit the knowledge we decide to integrate.

In our great country we have many freedoms, one of them is the freedom to read, hear and see what we want. We all have different perspectives that come with this freedom, such as what we watch on TV, what we read in our free time, and what music we like to listen to. However, if we had the right to remove things that we don't like, we will spoil the enjoyment of others. It would end up taking away our freedom. Many writers, musicians and directors have said that this freedom is important for having a pleasant and creative life. As individuals, we have different perspectives on a lot of things. Fortunately, our freedoms allow us to have these opinions without interfering with the opinions or ideas of others. If we took away books, films, magazines, etc., there would be nothing for nobody. Our libraries would be emptied, the classrooms would have no more books and the stores would have nothing. We shouldn't have the right to remove anything that we think is inappropriate or that does not respect our values or interests. Even though the right to take things out seems like a good idea, we should consider the thoughts and ideas of others. Consider a public library, it has books for children, teens, and adults with individual preferences, and a school library with books for kids and teens with their own preferences on what they like to read. If we grant this right, then those libraries that allow individuality could not exist. People would be unable to live up to their individual freedoms. Everyone should be allowed to be themselves. Imagine what it would be like if we extended this right to the food we buy. We all have different food tastes which terrify and satisfy us. The foods we choose are a lot like the books we read, there are types we favor and others we will just try to avoid. No one would have anything to eat in restaurants, schools or elsewhere, not even at home. It would turn out to be a disaster. We shouldn't have that right because it wouldn't be fair to anyone. Our @ MONTH1 views are different but we have similar needs. The freedom we have is a freedom of choice. If we don't find a certain book, movie, or magazine to be appropriate, we should choose to allow others a chance to take it and see if it fits their values and interests. Other people will allow this chance as well. After all, it wasn't individuality and choice that made the freedoms we have @ DATE1

Should books be removed from shelves if they are offensive ? Who would determine whether or not something is offensive and to whom does it offend ? These are just two questions that can create a high level of conflict and trouble among many people. Would removing books from the shelves limit our ability to learn or see something from a different point of view? First of all, who decides what is offensive and to whom it offends ? It is possible that anything will offend anyone. Also, removing a book from the shelves might be offensive to the writer and his followers. Talking about taking a book off the shelves might cause more problems than just letting the book stay on the shelves. If the problem is offending others, wouldn't it be better to leave that aside, rather than making it a problem to please one group but upset another? Second, could removing a book from the shelves limit your ability to learn something or hear something from another point of view ? If books that offended people had always been taken down for the sake of offending others, we might not have a lot of knowledge that we have today. For example, a biology book might be offensive to people whose religion explains things differently and make things wrong, and a religious document such as "The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2" or "The @ CAPS3" might be offensive to people. people who believe in biology books to be true. If we took both types of books off the shelves because they were offensive, we wouldn't have religion or modern science. This example can be used for any subject or genre of book, because people may find many different things offensive. As a solution, I believe it is true that it is not possible to please everyone. If one person is happy, another is offended. If that person is happy, the first person is offended. If the books could possibly be tagged as " some might be offensive " or " the material @ MONTH1 be offensive " then people have a disclaimer and they can choose whether they want to read it or not. If they are offended, they cannot blame the author or the place where they got the book because there was a warning. It would be like parental warnings on CDs. This @ MONTH1 does not solve the problem of offended people, but it could drastically reduce the number of complaints about an offensive book. In conclusion, books should just be left on the shelves no matter how people complain that they are offensive. Books taken off the shelves could turn into all books taken off the shelves, which means no education or learning. It is simply not an option. Leaving books that offend some people on the shelves @ MONTH1 causes controversy with others, but if some sort of warning could be put in place and the proper procedures put in place, the problems should decrease dramatically. Think about it all the next time you want a book to be taken off the shelves.

I agree with Katherine's statement, but to an extent. If a book or magazine contains name names or anything offensive, then a student should bring it to the librarian and let him know he is offended. Especially if it's in a middle school or an elementary school. Of course, there will be a book, movie, or magazine that contains something inappropriate. One day my friend and I were in the library looking for a book to read, and that's when I discovered the @ CAPS1 series. But as I got into the books, the more mature they got. In the last book, @ ORGANIZATION1, there is a lot of profanity. But that doesn't mean I'm not mature enough not to know what that means. Ditto with any other high school student. But you can't protect your kids from everything. Not even swear words. So if you see a book in a local library that is absolutely filled with offensive stuff and you decide to delete it, just take it to your librarian and confront him. I am sure they will understand. Or maybe they won't, and they'll wait and see if anyone else wants it deleted. What I'm saying is you can't always protect your kids from violent words, movies, or magazines. But you can still hold on and try

What impact do adult books have on children? Recently people have tried to censor libraries for what they have seen, what their children are reading, or acting in recent times. I don't agree with censorship in libraries. Instead of censoring, libraries maybe have a section for explicit books or things to keep small children from reading them. First of all, instead of deleting all the books, maybe you should consider creating a section just for people of a certain age. Create a section at the back of the library and ask @ CAPS1 to confirm that it is old enough. This would allow the library to keep all of its books and keep all of its creators happy and most importantly, keep parents happy. Another reason not to censor libraries would be that the number of builders would slow down. It would make the builders unhappy and the library would lose popularity for not having the books that people want to read. I can also see why they try to censor libraries because of children's behaviors. With censorship in libraries, that would prevent little children from acting the way they do in a book. But @ CAPS2 would be better not to censor libraries and please the people who read them. In the end, I don't agree with censorship of libraries because @ CAPS2 would disturb people reading them and probably the library population would decrease which would mean people would stop visiting the library. So people who disagree should act now so that libraries can stay as they are now

The @ CAPS1 on Books In today's world, everything is shown in every place you look. Libraries are used by many people, people go there to research, study, and even just to find an interesting book to read. One of the problems that some people have is the display of personal items. I believe libraries should have censorship. Why should libraries have one? Here are my reasons. One of the reasons that censorship in libraries is a good idea is that young children are looking for books there. Any parent will tell you that they wouldn't like the idea of their child reading something very detailed and adult-like at all. A library should be a place where children, young adults and the elderly can get away from reality, not somewhere where they worry about the book they might pull off the shelf. If libraries still want to keep certain books in stock, they should start an age limit for those books. Limiting the age of books will prevent young audiences from viewing them. Another thing they could do with the age limit is that parents could set the age limit with the library on when their child should be allowed to view certain books. Also, another way to help stop offensive viewing is for parents to watch what their children are reading, watching, and listening to. Parents could help by keeping tabs on what their child is doing. Censorship is a wonderful way to stop viewing adult-like issues. More public places should start a system of them. The world needs to understand that some audiences are not yet ready for reality

libraries all over the world contain all kinds of books, both good and bad. there will always be something in a book that @ MONTH1 will offend the reader or someone close to the reader. it depends on the sensitivity of the people. the main reason people want to ban books or have them removed from libraries is because of racial slurs, religion and sexual content. I think it should be the choice of libraries to put the book on the shelf or take it off. magazines are a problem with movies and different kinds of music. according to some libraries, they are just ransacked with movies, books, etc. vulgar, racial or bad. if parents are afraid that their children might rent these things, they should block them. if you want to rent bad things, you should have parental permission. taking all these things out of the library is not a solution. all it does is create anger and lead to lawsuits and more. the library should create separate classified book sections so that children cannot get the “bad” books into their hands. of the story or how the character really feels inside. if stories like '@ CAPS1 in The @ CAPS2' didn't have anger, emotion or passion it would be a boring book. the authors put language, sexual content and violence into books, films and magazines to entertain certain crowds. if you take these things out, some people will not have the fun they enjoyed with the things they have read or could possibly read

@ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 on a day when there are no books in the school library. A librarian walks through the now empty hallways, remembering the days before the censorship, before everyone tells her what they found offensive. Everyone's ideas are different, but that doesn't mean everyone has to follow them. In saying this, if someone finds a book offensive, they just shouldn't take it. Don't read it ! By pushing for the removal of the book, they would imply that they know best, and generally, they don't know best. A @ CAPS2 might be offended by a fashion magazine in the library @ LOCATION1 simply has a shower gel advertisement. She @ MONTH1 says something like "@ CAPS3 the child shouldn't see things like this", then asks that it be removed from the library. Does this make sense? I didn't think so either. Also, if a woman was able to pull out a magazine from the library, then another man or woman would believe that she had the same power. Censorship could become an occasional thing, and books could be thrown away daily! Now it is only on a small scale. @ CAPS1 if they really discussed it with higher authorities. This book would be withdrawn from all schools in @ LOCATION1 brings us to this problem. Should we, as people, as normal citizens, really decide what others are able to read ? The answer to that is a categorical no. Let's look at the other end of that now, too. What will happen to the authors who wrote the now banned books? As an example, I'll use @ PERSON1. What would happen to him if the series '@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5' were banned in schools? What about children who like to read? It's just taking good books away from students ... Because someone didn't believe in magic and made a fit of it. This early librarian is leaving now, there are no more books to consult, bring back or read. Children have to go to a public library to get all the books they want to read, and then are discouraged from reading because the material was not appropriate. It shouldn't happen. Books don't need to be censored, and people who have a problem with a book just shouldn't be messing it up for everyone.

Censorship Should certain documents (books, music, films, magazines, etc.) be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive ? I think it depends on how offensive the material is. If it is something very provocative or racist or advanced beyond the years of those who have access to it, then it should not be allowed. Or, the material should be restricted or placed in a special section that only certain people have access to. It depends on the level of intelligence, maturity and age of the people who have access to these documents. I don't think these materials should be removed, but limited. Some should be left at school or in the library, but it is also the parents' responsibility. If a child has permission to access certain material, they should be allowed to do so if their guardian deems it appropriate. Sometimes tutors consider @ MONTH1 not to be the same as the library or schools, but this mainly depends on the tutor. Schools and libraries cannot really challenge the morals or intelligence of people. Overall, I don't think documents like books, music, movies, magazines etc. should be removed unless deemed necessary by a group of people including relatives , teachers and / or school board members, and / or library staff. Just because a mom thinks a book is inappropriate for her child doesn't mean that another should be banned. Everyone has a different opinion and idea of what is acceptable, so it's not fair that everyone should trust one person's idea. If you don't want your child to have access to certain material, just don't let them access it. If you think this is not appropriate material that a child can access, you can voice it, but others @ MONTH1 disagree. Materials considered inappropriate by a respectable group should be restricted or carry a warning, but not a ban.

If you found a movie you really enjoyed in the library, would you get mad if the library just won out and there was no other place to get it ? If a person doesn't like something they see in the library, that doesn't mean it's not educational, and get rid of it. Just because someone doesn't like something doesn't mean someone else will. I don't think they should be getting rid of movies, music, books or magazines because of one person. Here is something that will make you think about getting rid of all of those categories. One thing I love about movies is that they're good for visual aids. some people learn better if they visualize something, they can better understand the purpose or cause of the situation, and they can learn faster. Another thing about the movies in the library is that they show you things in the movie that you wouldn't be able to see if you were just reading a book. One thing that I personally love is that when people are in movies, it's like you're talking to me like me and the actor is really chatting. When you watch a movie, it gives you a visual picture of what's going on, even if the content isn't appropriate. This is all the reasons why I think movies shouldn't be taken down because someone thinks movies are big and uncensored. Music is another rule they shouldn't get rid of. Music is almost the only thing you can calm down so that you can concentrate again. Another thing that music does for you is that it calms the mind so that you can relax and not disturb anyone else. When you listen to music, it blocks out other sounds that might distract you. so these are the reasons why the music should not be deleted. Magazines and books are the foundation of a library. If you got rid of it, it wouldn't be a library anymore. books are the basic learning methods of education. People learn the most information from a book or magazine. If you take them away, it's like trying to withhold people from the education and knowledge that they have in the books. So if you got rid of magazines and books, it wouldn't even be a library anymore. if you get rid of the movies in the library, people want to be able to have a visual aid as an alternative learning medium. If you get rid of the music in the library, you won't be able to focus on one thing as well if you are constantly disturbed by other noises around you. Last but not least, if you got rid of the books in the library, it wouldn't be a library anymore, it would just be a place to go like any other place. The library would be nothing. Would you like this now ? Thank you

I'm a lot of stuff but I'm not surley a reader. But I believe you should be able to post whatever you want on any topic. weather forecast which is a graphic novel or a didry magazine. nothing should be taken off the shelf to be offensive if it offends you for not picking it up, let alone reading it. Let's say I wanted to write a book but people say it was too gross, I would still be able to write it and sell it. whatever someone has a problem with, they try to bundle it up or get rid of it. instead, why don't they just get over it? we have rights for every person, from me to you, we all have them and should be able to use them to the fullest extent that they can be used. Call me the old fashioned way, but I believe in free speech and the freedoms we have lost soldiers for and the freedoms we have every day of our lives. I think drinking every @ DATE1 of the week is wrong, but you don't see me on the news screaming about it, no I take care of it like people should handle things they don't like not. So I hope in this essay I made some good points in making sacrifices and facing things and not acting on something that you shouldn't be able to change, thank you for taking the time to read this.

Libraries are teeming with books, magazines, music, films and more. All materials cover a very wide range of topics. For example, the movies can be a comedy, a mystery, or an adventure. However, some of this content is not suitable for some viewers and may be very offensive to them. For this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries. One of the reasons that offensive material should be removed from libraries is that it can lead to teen violence. If a teenager continually reads books or watches movies that contain violence, then he might think that violent behavior is okay. They might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems, and they will not realize that there are other solutions to a problem. A case that proves that seeing offensive material can lead to violence in a high school. A straight-A student got a grade she thought she didn't deserve from a teacher. This student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and brought a knife into the teacher's classroom during school. She then threatened to kill the teacher. She came up with the idea for the movie '@ CAPS1', and her costume looked like @ CAPS2. Some students in the class at the time called @ NUM1, and the police convinced the girl to put the knife down. Maybe if she hadn't seen the movie, she wouldn't have threatened to kill her teacher. Another reason why offensive material should be removed from libraries is that the material is sometimes inappropriate for young children. Children can just look at books and magazines in the library without even consulting them. This way, no one will know that they have read it. Some books in libraries deal with topics like sex and drugs. When the child is reading this, he may want to do whatever is in the book. I read a book that contains sex and drugs. The book might put terrible ideas into the child's head if he read it. After all, offensive material should be removed from libraries. The material can lead to acts of violence in people, although it does not appear that this kind of behavior could come from that person. The material may also be inappropriate for young children. Overall, the material in libraries can be offensive to some people.

Libraries have all kinds of books. Books for everyone. I think libraries shouldn't have to take books down because some people don't like them, or find it shocking, while others might like the author. If there's a book in the library that you find unpleasant, don't just throw it at it, just put it back on the shelf and get on with your day. As author Katherine Paterson said, if we start removing books from the shelves, there will be no more books to read. Yes, there are books out there that are not intended for small children and some adults, but that's why you don't let them read them until you think they're old enough. Just because you don't like the book doesn't mean no one else likes it. Everyone has their own taste in reading, like everything else. Libraries have sections for all ages. With books for his age. As the children's section is for small children and the adult section is for adults. Small children should not crack the books in the adult section. Parents should take responsibility for their children and watch what they do. Then we wouldn't have to worry about what they read, watch or listen to. Libraries are doing very well as they are, and have been for years, and will do so for years to come. So no library should have to remove certain books from the shelves just because someone doesn't like it or wants a child to read it. Just ignore that the book is even there and find another that works for you. People learn a lot from books, so if we get rid of most of them, what will we learn then? Books are a big part of the story. Why get rid of your story? It’s just wrong. Books should stay where they are and where they belong.

Libraries have books that are short, long, and everything in between. They are good books and bad, but it all depends on the reader's opinion. There is no reason that if someone is offended by a book in a library, it should be taken off the shelf. The books on a library shelf are there for everyone to read, so if any of them are deleted then someone else is missing the chance to have the experience of reading that book . Would you have food destroyed if it didn't taste good to you? No, you won't get it anymore. So why does anyone have the right to delete a book because it has been offended, that is not fair, your opinions on something are only an opinion, nothing more. Your views are not the same as @ PERSON1 who lives on the street, so by deleting a book it pushes your viewpoint onto someone else. In conclusion, the books in question could be good or bad in the eyes of the next person who reads them. Arrogant people are not normally liked by others. Books are intended to be read and interpreted by the reader. That's why no one has the right to take it off the shelf.

'Everyone in the world has an opinion, some people @ MONTH1 find them offensive, but there are also people who find it interesting and like to read, listen and watch the material. Personally I have never had this kind of problem, I have only been to the library about @ NUM1 times, I usually rent movies. there are people who can't deal with certain things like blood and guts or racism in books, movies and music, but at the same time there are people who love it, it's their thing. I think it would be wrong to deprive them of what they find interesting, of what they like to read or watch and listen. some people will say it's vulgar although people will say it's a centerpiece or that what they're doing is boring and doesn't have an interesting moral. Libraries usually don't have things that are too gory or things that have too much sexual content that they could in books but not movies or magazines. Now music these days can be quite vulgar and disrespectful, it can also be very sexual and contain a lot of gang violence which has become a big problem with our children. Libraries usually have old school music like michael jackson, The @ CAPS1, and slow jams like @ CAPS2-kelly, and positive and smooth old rap, good old country music, and good soothing jazz. The music our children use today has all of these depressing and violent morals that don't need to be shared with some of these young and imitating minds. I think they shouldn't take it off the shelves, but I think you have to be a certain age to access these things.

Today, it seems like everything you can imagine is out there somewhere in the world, one way or another. Whether it's in a magazine, book, music or movies doesn't matter. The point is, if there are good things out there then you can usually assume that bad things are there too. These bad things are lying around the shelves of our libraries nationwide, waiting for someone to open them and indulge in their naughty, intense, or graphic ways. As @ CAPS1, every man has the right to do or read whatever he wants. But what if it's not a man at all but actually a child? This kid doesn't choose to read such bad stuff, but just stumbles upon it. Should they be punished for accidentally encountering and reading this material ? Which begs the question; who is to blame and what is the solution? It's a good and respectable idea to censor certain things in libraries, but if someone wants to read something they should be able to, right? This is a very delicate situation and determining the answer should be a long and thoughtful process looking at the question from all angles and from different perspectives. The people who have brought this issue to the surface more than likely have personal experiences that make them feel so strongly about their take on censorship in libraries, just like me. On a hot, dry day @ DATE1, I wanted to find something to do inside. So instead of staying at home all day, I went down to the library. I had been there many times this @ DATE1 and was quite familiar with their selection, so I was looking for something new. So I stepped away from the children's section and walked through other areas of the library. There were so many choices and options at my fingertips. I was sick of reading all the headlines so I did what any other kid usually would, and something parents have been telling their kids not to do for centuries; I judged the books by their covers. I found one that looked interesting, and to make a long story short, I stumbled upon a love story. But not the kind I was used to. It was an adult book and I wanted vivid details about the relationship of a sexually active older couple. Needless to say, I was speechless. Reading this stuff when I was a kid scared me a lot. However, this leads me to believe that it would be wise for censorship to be implemented in libraries. Of course, not all children will have the same experience as me. In fact hardly any willpower. But I know I was traumatized. So I can easily imagine how other people felt when the same or something really similar happened to them. But for all the other people who have things not happened to them or have not stumbled upon such material would probably think it is unfair that things are taken away from them just because other people cannot handle them. . But if you were like me, or any other innocent kid who discovered and experienced some things that they just weren't ready for, wouldn't you agree that library censorship is good for everyone? the world ? If you want more intense or more available things, you can go to a bookstore instead of a public library. I am a teenager and have no children, but I can only imagine how you mothers and fathers would feel if it was their children who were emotionally scarred by experiences that they could have been. protected in the first place. Children should be children and not have to worry about the bad things in this world, and the most effective way to keep this as it is is to censor books, music, magazines, and movies on. the shelves of public libraries.

Every day, hundreds of people visit your local library. The library offers an array of things such as books, music, movies, magazines, and newspapers, but what “ limits ” does the library have on the content of these things ? All kinds of people go to the library. I go to the library, you go to the library, moms, dads, aunts, uncles, siblings, we all go to the library at some point in our lives. Different crowds of people have different interests which @ MONTH1 offend others. The question is, should we limit or exclude certain topics in libraries? Limiting or censoring the mass media that we have in our libraries would almost empty them. The truth is, someone, somewhere, is going to take offense at the stuff in most libraries ; you can never please everyone. Also, some of these topics could be used for educational purposes. Take anatomy books for example. While high school and college students use these books and diagrams for study, some mothers find them inappropriate for their young children. This is why libraries have separate sections for different audiences. There could be a section for kids, a section for tweens, and an adult section to help resolve this issue. In addition, everyone has different interests. Personally, I hate rap music, but my sister loves it. Even though I find some of the things they say in these songs offensive, it's my choice whether or not to listen to them. Songwriters, singers, publishers and songwriters who write this material are free to do so. Who are we to tell them that they can't write about sex, drugs, or murder because, let's face it, these things are part of our everyday life. If children don't see these things in libraries, they will end up encountering them elsewhere. Should we remove “ offensive ” material from libraries ? No. If we do this, there will be no books to read, no movies to watch or music to listen to because everyone will be offended by something.

Dear @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 Journal @ CAPS4, the artedclie you wrote last week really touches me. The one about do you think certain documents, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive to certain people. I went back to it, first I thought if it was offensive to some people we should delete it, but if it offends people then why are we selling it to people but then I think again and I It was as if people were entitled to the freedom of space and if that was how they should speak, then let them space their minds. this great court of ares was made on the right that everyone is made the same and everyone is attached to the freedom of space. if people have what to talk about like they do in music or act like they do in their movies, it's life if you don't like it don't buy it you even have to pay attention to it. Say if i was a rapist like lil wayne or someone like that i would care about people talking like they are bucese it's my way of cultivating the world what i feel about things i care about. if someone writes something in a book you don't like don't go out of their way to go on tv shows to make fun of you or until you feel up, write a letter to the author and say- their what you think of the subject. every black, white, yellow, brown or even green person has the right to freedom of space. was given to us for a ressen and i think it was for that even if you have an idia but you think it's supted just saying it because some people think it's amazing or not. but everyone is created the same, so treat people like you're not used to being treated. I want to thank you for reading this. your artedcile really opened my eyes to the world and how I would see it. thanks for writing it. best regards, @ PERSON1

I think that this kind of books can sometimes offend some people who, depending on the genre or type of book, magazine, movie, music, don't want to see it and agree and disagree on it because this is a certain type of think that is not bad for children like games for their age or music that is suitable for their age and others like animals, cultures and all that thinks but who just thinks i disagree is that they can't be books, music, magazines, or even movies that have sex accusation that stuff is wrong not in a library I think that stuff like this can be dangerous or affectionate for some parents and people who have or don't have children and I think if they are in some libraries that I agree that 'they have to take this off because I don't want or people want children to be disrespectful and learn this kind of think they are wrong with their upbringing and with their age. I also don't agree that this kind of music that some artists say they take on drugs and gongs and drug trafficking and even sex and I know that because sometimes I hear this on @ CAPS1 and at the radio that they sin and this influence on children have a different direction in their life and we as parents don't want this for our children, we don't want this for their future, we want them to have have a good future and be successful and give them the same example for their kids to go, they get worked up and become a parent and they go see what we're talking about. I've been seen and in some parts of the world people have been killed or people killing other innocent people for this stuff more for drugs that they sell drugs and they make money than they hurt other people or children who use this drug which can be our children or friends, and sometimes if they don't pay the money they have to pay they kill them or the police will about to find out the m because are thinking bad thoughts and hope this artist, or the people who put this in the libraries first think that they maybe doing something wrong with steff who think they do something right

Censorship of Books Censorship in libraries is a major problem in @ LOCATION1. The question is, "Should we have an age limit on what people can view?" Or another question is, " @ CAPS1 have they let my kid check it out ?" " @ CAPS2 are very frequently asked questions and should draw attention to them. In my opinion, books should have an age limit. My reasoning is that kids under @ NUM1 should have a place where they can find good books for their age group. There are many books for all ages. A child under @ NUM1, should not be able to view any book, magazine, movie, or music that contains offensive language, racial slurs, or dirty behavior on the part of the character or artist. Another reason why @ CAPS1 libraries should have an age limit on what you can browse is because kids can get the wrong idea. Let's say a book has a statement that says "@ CAPS3 I went to my best friend and drank alcohol". @ CAPS4 would be something a child shouldn't be able to read. This would give the child the wrong idea of what he "could" do. The age limits for book shelves should be as follows : @ CAPS5 @ NUM3 @ NUM4 @ NUM5 @ NUM6 @ NUM1- @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 books in the @ CAPS2 age ranges would probably help stop the chorus on parents who are worried about what their child is reading. In addition, it would help the child decide what to read. I really think the @ CAPS7 books in the @ CAPS2 age groups will stop the fuss. Censorship is a major problem in @ LOCATION1. With everything I've listed I'm pretty sure the " Should we have an age limit on what people can view ?" " And" @ CAPS1 they let my child check this ? " with being answered. Age groups on the books is a great idea.

There are books up and down in the library shelves that @ MONTH1 make people wonder @ CAPS1 that they are up there. @ MONTH1 people are standing there looking at a book and wondering, " @ CAPS1 in the world is this book here ? " @ @ MONTH1 CAPS2 many people do not know is that every book in the world for a reason. Published books are in the world to teach history, manners, literature, or they could be made to take advantage of you. Sure, you @ MONTH1 come across a book that @ MONTH1 is offensive to someone, maybe even yourself, but it's there for a reason. I once read a book I found in our school library that was about slavery. It was a first person novel about a boy who was taken from his family after being sold to another plantation owner. Now, some people would have been very offended by this book, because @ CAPS3 called @ CAPS4 all those names that @ CAPS4 don't like to be called. But this book helps people realize how much slavery hurts people. People can go to any library, from an elementary school to a public library, and you will always find at least one book on @ CAPS6. Almost everyone would be offended by any of these books because no one has liked or like @ CAPS7, but they must be there because of the story. People can't just get the books out because it offends so many people. It would be like taking the @ CAPS6 out of history, and it just can't happen. If it happened, it happened, and people need to know it. Whether people admit it or not, they stumbled upon at least one book that offended them. It will happen, it's almost natural that it happens. But it would also offend people if you took books off the shelves. These people know that books teach us, and we need books to know that @ CAPS2 is possible, @ CAPS2 has happened and @ CAPS2 could happen. Books are there for a reason, and they must stay

I think some material like books, movies, magazines etc. should not be deleted if they are offensive to others because censorship and libraries have their own right to have what they want on their shelves. Yes, you @ MONTH1 say that some of the things are not suitable for children to see, but there is a children's side in every library so that children don't have to see inappropriate things. I feel like no one has the right to tell another store where to find their stuff. Also, I can understand where the author is from, but you have to understand that there are people out there in @ LOCATION1 who would like to read or listen to inappropriate things that parents would not allow children to see or listen. I would also consider that @ CAPS2, @ CAPS1 do not let your child (ies) go to that library or that place where you know there is despicable material. Everyone has their personal right to put things where they want them to be. There are many other options, @ CAPS2 can order their books online or go to the library with their child. When I was a young girl, my mom never let me go anywhere, so I never had to worry about seeing anything inappropriate or out of place. Now one day at @ DATE1, the kids know right from wrong. Children know what they are supposed to read and don't know it. I also agree if a librarian or an adult sees or hears children watching or listening to something they know they shouldn't be, they should stop the child or speak to him from the premises. So no I don't agree with you. I still think people should have the right to put things there where they want because it's their business and their property.

Have you ever read a book or magazine that you despised and thought that if that book was taken off the shelves, it would save a lot of people a waste of time? Or have you ever read a book or heard a song that didn't offend you, but might offend other people because of their race or gender ? A lot of people run into this problem and personally I have run into this problem, but that doesn't mean it needs to be taken off the shelf. If everyone in the world goes to a library and takes a book from the shelf of their local library to throw it away, only one whom they absolutely despise because of their personal reason or just because they don't. don't like, there would hardly be any books left! If someone has a problem with the content of a book, magazine, or song, then don't read or listen to it. Other people @ MONTH1 like to read on this topic or like this kind of music. I understand that some @ MONTH1 books are offensive to some people, but don't read them if you offend them. Slavery books @ MONTH1 may offend some people, but this is ancient history and some people might like to know more about this topic, or @ MOIS1 even needs this information for a research project. There are also many books on @ CAPS1, some people @ MONTH1 find it offensive, or @ MONTH1 don't want their kids to read about it, but it is old history. It's a time in the past and it's @ MONTH1 something a high school student is researching. I did a research paper on @ CAPS1 and read some very mature material that young children @ MONTH1 don't need to learn right now, but I wouldn't suggest removing all books from the @ CAPS1 from the shelves of our local library. There are many different reasons to read a book and if you want to read a book for fun and end up reading one that you find offensive, choose another topic to read because some people @ MOIS1 like to read on that topic . Just because a person doesn't like a book or the subject covered by the book doesn't give anyone the right to take the book off the shelf because they think it sends the wrong message to young children or might offend some people. If people don't want their kids to read on this topic, tell them when they pick up a book from the library not to buy a book on that topic. If it becomes too important that people start to find a lot of books that offend them or other people, then suggest that the library have a list of the books and their subjects. Each library could be required to have a list of books and have the suggested age of readers next to it, or there could be different sections of the library. A section for children, a section for adolescents, a section for adults and a section for middle-aged people. Also, if this absolutely has to happen, each library can have computers where you can search for the book and see what that book is about. This will give you an idea of what the book is about before you read it, so if there is a certain topic that offends you, you can go ahead and find another book and find out what this one is about. It would help a lot of people not to read books that offend them and it would help them find a book that is more suitable for what they want to read. Songs are a whole different subject. An artist or songwriter will write, rap, and sing songs about whatever they want. If people find the profanity in the song offensive, then don't listen to it. There's no way you can tell a songwriter not to sing or rap whatever he wants, and stores are going to sell albums that get them business. If people don't want their kids to use that kind of language or message that the song gives off, they can just tell their kids not to listen to it because the artists are going to write songs, rap songs, and sing. songs about what's gonna make them money, and that's just a fact.

Books, magazines, music and movies should not be removed from the shelves. They always have good information that someone other than you @ MONTH1 wants to know. If you take them off the shelves, people who want to use them don't have the option. If you take books out, if someone needs them for a research paper they need to do, they won't have the resources to do the paper, and at the same time, the person with the paper @ MONTH1 thinks that non-educational books need to come off the shelves and that person won't get the books they want. If they want the book to be taken off the shelves, due to inappropriate language or nudity, libraries may make it so that you have to be a certain age to access it. I was at the library and there was a woman who got upset because her son had a movie and a book that she didn't think was good for him to have. The book and the movie he had were in a different area so minors weren't supposed to get them. So the woman would probably be the one who wanted to take them off the shelves, but it wasn't the libraries' fault that he wasn't where he was supposed to be. The products have to stay on the shelves, because someone needs them for something, otherwise they wouldn't have been there in the first place. If they take the products that some people don't like, those who like them won't get them. If there is a reason people need to have the product on a shelf, the product needs to go somewhere else, accessible to people who want you the products. The products should stay on the shelves so that people who need them or just want to use the products can use them.

A @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ MONTH1 @ CAPS3: Does censorship, @ CAPS2 deserve a place in our society? There has been a lot of controversy on this topic. Some claim that certain types of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others on the same subject think the opposite. They believe that artists 'and writers' words show feelings and have messages hidden in vulgar words, which is where I stand on the situation. @ CAPS2 seems like every time we cross that bridge, @ CAPS2 comes right back in front of us. Many of those who oppose the freedom of writing and music are usually those who feel that they have to prepare for a proper education and that not everyone acts less the same, unfortunately for a lot, people who are like that usually have a lot of power. in terms of what's to come and what's going on, not allowing many of us, the lower-ranked people in society, to have the ability to veto our poor outlook. My opinions lead me to believe that there are also two sides to this story. However, I still believe that much of what is considered " censored " material should not be censored at all. There is a, count that, a situation where I think censorship is necessary. One is songs that are @ NUM1 and a half minutes long saying nothing but "* beep * this, and * beep that". Any other material, whether @ CAPS2 is rap @ CAPS4 or writing @ PERSON1, is acceptable. There are just a lot of people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics / words, to get the full message before automatically assuming there is something wrong with @ CAPS2. Awesome @ CAPS5, @ ORGANIZATION1, he always has a message in his music, whether @ CAPS2 is about family or just life in general, however many words he uses are considered unsuitable in our time, you don’t 'so hear that' * beep * 'when @ CAPS2 is on the radio. By this simple " * beep * ", you can lose the message which passes. Also, have you ever heard the expression “ equal rights ” ? Well, shouldn't music and literature be a right? @ CAPS2 is like speaking, but with pages or instruments. And so I leave you on this questionable subject. I hope I was able to change some opinions about you today, if not your ruin. Thank you for your time. A @ CAPS6 at @ CAPS7, @ LOCATION1

Everyone had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media are not exactly suitable for children. Today's songs allude to sexual activity. Books about creepy vampires and werewolves are published. There are even films that depict violent and inappropriate behavior that children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, like a library? Several people would agree, but I disagree. Growing up @ PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. His music was fun and unbeatable, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. His words seemed to mean nothing, until you thought about it a little more. Even while watching the clips, they show actions and pictures that small children shouldn't copy. Some @ MONTH1 limit their child to this type of material, but I would call it depriving a child of their freedom. You can go to any public library and browse through many selections of books, DVDs, CDs, and even magazines. Some libraries even make computers available to the public. Not all places will feature your favorite artist, movies, or readings, but they think it's not something little kids should indulge in. Who can say that a small child cannot enjoy the material they would like? It's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were limited to a one-minded path. Limiting a child's media could benefit him in one way or another. Restricting time on computers, limiting the number of hours playing video games or watching TV could help teach a child time management skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they have learned or share it with an adult and it might get them in trouble. However, libraries should not have to remove offensive media from the shelves. Age restrictions for the rental of these types of offensive material should be set. Just because a book or movie has language and pictures are created that should not be seen by children, doesn't mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on the rental of this equipment may be set. That would solve all the problems, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public libraries could be beneficial, but they should simply set an age limit for rental instead of removing all material together. Therefore, to make parents happier and not to restrict a person's freedom to develop their own opinion and preferences on different types of media

Do you believe in hiding books and movies that exceed @ CAPS1 ? Do you think children can control themselves with offensive behavior? Have you ever seen a kid watch a horror movie that was @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 ? Why do you think most parents block this kind of viewing of their young children ? I believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from children's shelves if they are found to be offensive. I totally agree that adults don't let kids watch that new horror movie or that action book their brother is reading. I think they should take into account the effects of watching or reading certain things. Young children still have their innocence. You don't want your child to have nightmares because you let them watch a movie with a rating greater than @ CAPS1. You would feel guilty if the child has problems for the rest of their life. You have to choose whether it is comfortable for them to see what they are watching or reading ! It is important to hide them so that the child cannot grab them. Pay attention to the kind of movies and books you leave in the library. You should have a section for children in the libraries. You should have all the material that a child should be interested in. It should be as colorful and playful as possible. I used to watch this girl named @ CAPS5. I babysat her one night while her parents were at the movies. I brought a movie to watch, when @ CAPS5 fell asleep. So once the clock went to @ NUM1 I put her to sleep. But I didn't know she woke up and @ ORGANIZATION1 watched me this horror movie called @ ORGANIZATION1. Blood spurted out everywhere and she started screaming! I thought I had secured her in her room to sleep but to my surprise she was still awake! I rushed over to her and put her back to sleep. hoping she didn't have nightmares. Be courteous of things you let children read or see. You have to think about the effects of what will happen to the child later in life. I know you think it's not that bad for kids, but it can really mess up their minds and actions forever. So I hope I have convinced you to take my advice and remove it from the @ CAPS1 movies and books for child safety

Everyone is @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 the person is @ CAPS1, which we can agree on. So why would people try to censor books, movies, magazines etc as I pointed out before we are all @ CAPS1 so we all have @ CAPS1 standards on what is bad and offensive to which is good. When we remove a book from a library shelf for any reason, others should have the same right to do so as they see fit. If I pick up a book on why @ CAPS3 is the right religion and am @ CAPS4, I will probably find it offensive. Yet if I gave that same book to a @ CAPS3, that person would probably read the exact same book as @ CAPS4 and not find it at all offensive. It all comes down to the views we all have on everything, so why would you let one person or even a small committee set standards on library censorship because they @ MONTH1 are feeling a certain way while another? committee or someone else feels completely @ CAPS1. Everyone is @ CAPS1 and experiences problems differently. There is no way to ensure that the @ CAPS2 book in the library will not offend a single person. The same problem can be applied to music, movies, magazines, etc. No matter what we do, someone will be offended. For example, the Pledge of Allegiance is something my school says every day, but some people, like @ ORGANIZATION1, find it offensive. All over the country people are saying it before school, a sports game, etc., but you don't see a lot of people objecting to it. I have observed that most of the people who find this offensive just ignore it, so why can't we do the same for books, movies, magazines etc. which we @ MONTH1 find offensive. In conclusion, there really is no way to put censorship in libraries since it doesn't matter what a person might or will find offensive. So why can't we just read what offends us, it really is the only way to avoid offending people. For these reasons, I think there should be no censorship in libraries.

Throughout the history of literature, many books have been banned from public libraries and shelves. They are all somewhat offensive to some people, but not to all. Even some books that include magic and fiction have been kicked out of some societies, simply because of certain religions and cultural backgrounds. I believe that there should never be a piece of literature that is completely forbidden in the public eye. When a book is banned, a piece of history is removed from the sight of others. A book that @ MONTH1 was banned in @ DATE1 could not be read by my mom or dad. My future children and I could never read it either. Documents that are withdrawn from the public are usually withdrawn due to a specific group complaining about its content. When I was about eight years old, I remember seeing on the news that people from @ LOCATION1 and other countries @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 were burning books from the @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 series, only because they contained magic. and ridiculous fiction. Maybe they were burnt because the @ CAPS5 despised its history and fictional stories, but that doesn't mean it should be banned from libraries. The @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 series is one of the most popular works of literature of my generation, and generations after mine should be able to enjoy it as much as we do. Before @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 started, @ CAPS11 started to be discriminated against. They were treated like sub-humans, like in this example. There was a night at @ DATE2 called @ CAPS12, when radical supporters of @ CAPS13 and @ CAPS14 torched the homes, stores and even books of @ CAPS11. Some of these books might have been the only copies, but @ ORGANIZATION1 let their hatred overcome them and destroyed the pieces of @ CAPS16's literature. Because @ ORGANIZATION1 found the @ CAPS16 job offensive, generations after @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 will never be able to read books burned during @ CAPS12. In the quote from Katherine Paterson, she says, "But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you also have the exact same right and everyone else too." And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. I believe she is correct in this quote. If literature continues to be censored, there will be none for future generations. No literature should be censored, not even the most radical, magical or fictitious. If censorship continues, the future of literature is doomed.

There are many works done in modern times which can be considered provocative or offensive. Some are even unsuitable for young eyes. There are many reasons some will come up with for removing these books from their shelves, but I don't think anyone, politician or artist, should have the right to deposit someone else's work. There are certainly books in libraries that would not be dreamed of being viewed by an ordinary person, but these books should not be deposited. I don't believe that a person's work, which is instilled with hope, money, beliefs and elbow grease, should be taken away from the public. No matter how offensive or how bad @ MONTH1 can be, it's their work and their time, and their heart and soul that they put into a book. It is the truth that this has been done in the past to contain rebellions and power shifts, but nonetheless, I still disagree. For example, even today it is illegal to have @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 from @ PERSON1 in @ LOCATION1. It's for a specific reason, of course, and not a bad one, but I think this book should still be available for people to read and learn from the past. As has been the case for many centuries, the ability to publish a book means the ability to remember forever, and many people put their soul into the book they write. These books represent the ability to think freely, and if one is to remove books from society, then one must also remove free will and free thought from society. This is particularly emphasized in @ PERSON2's dark psychological science fiction novel, @ CAPS3 @ NUM1. This book is almost prophetic in descriptions of future society from a person's point of view at @ DATE1, and almost completely accurate as to what would happen if books were taken out of society, and was even himself- even censored for a long time. Of course, this conveys the extremist view of censorship and is unlikely to happen in the near future, at least. It is, however, a grim omen of what is to come if censorship is allowed freely. There are many opinions that one can have on a single topic, book or idea. This does not mean, however, that if it is seen as bad, it should be put down. This applies to music, movies, magazines, websites, and books. If you take them out of society in any form, then from a raw point of view, they take a piece of flavor and individuality out of society. If censorship is left free, even if it is just about " extremist " or " radical " ideals , then people will never have the full capacity to learn from their mistakes and know what to do about the future. , which will simply be history, it will repeat itself. Of course, it's not my view that governments should just let terrorists and radicals spread their ideals as they please. Once it is proven that any of them pose a threat or threat to the public, they must be arrested and convicted for their wrongs. There is no doubt in my mind that the law should be obeyed, but it should not overstep its limits. . Censorship, taken as a whole, is a useful process for the public good, but overall it takes away the ability to see life's stark, cold truths. This prevents some from learning to be truly safe, to think and believe in their ideals. When politicians cross the boundaries of art, music, literature, and even education to some extent, and try to prevent it from blossoming as it naturally would, then something has to be do. I'm not inciting rebellion, but I really don't believe that politics should rule over the artistic soul of the average man. This in itself is how society becomes self-destructive and loses its interest and connection with the world.

There are many different people who have opinions about what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it is in books, movies, music, or any other type of media. So, should libraries be more stringent and remove some material that might seem offensive or vulgar to parents or even students? I believe it completely depends on how a library advertises or who it checks what. I know a certain case, which is unique to me, is that my mom didn't like me reading a particular series because she didn't think it was appropriate reading for me. Because of this, it doesn't mean that she went to the library and demanded that they get rid of all the books written by this author. She respected that other people liked to read books and just asked me to avoid them and find something more suitable for me to read. In many libraries I know there are certain areas for specific age groups like children, teens, and adults. In those specific designated areas, they have a kind of “sub-area” where they separate education from entertainment and so on. Let's say a parent is offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section, should they ask the library to remove it completely ? I don't think it will help anything as there are students who use this topic for the areas they study and parents who use it as teaching aids with their own children. I believe libraries should put stamps or notices on their different types of media indicating that only a certain age group is out loud to view them and be able to verify them. An eight-year-old shouldn't be able to pick up an @ NUM1 movie whenever they want. There should be restrictions on areas like this, but for someone to come in and say remove all @ NUM1 movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy this kind of entertainment. Libraries should respect that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable as possible for everyone. They'll have separate kids' videos from the adult videos and they'll even have a whole separate section of books to explore and browse. The only thing that I think shouldn't be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos. A library is still a public and family space, after all, and no child should accidentally stumble upon a scorching item. So, should libraries completely remove media zones? I do not think so. I think they should distinguish between adult and children's materials. Katherine Paterson said, 'But if I have the right to remove books from the shelf ... . . then you also have exactly the same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. If we keep removing books from the shelves, eventually there will be nothing left to read.

People @ MONTH1 have some reason to take something off the shelves like books, magazines, @ CAPS1, etc. Whether these reasons are personal or professional, it is rather important. Some @ MONTH1 find the material offensive to themselves. Others might find it inappropriate to have something like this available to the younger generation. And writing or music might be considered unnecessary and irrelevant. The world contains a lot of things that can be offensive to someone. This person could be an educated person or a high school dropout. Out of all the things in the world, someone is going to find something offensive to themselves or to other people. It could be a phrase an author uses or the name of a song. But taking something away from people is not fair and should not be allowed unless it is very offensive. They might choose to stay away from that sort of thing. Unless the offender is very public and offends virtually everyone, then should he be removed. Other documents might simply be clearly inappropriate for some to have access to. If there was a book on how to rob a bank or how to make cocaine, it should be deleted as it would cause problems that could never have happened. People could learn to do these things anyway, but allowing this to be public information would be like starting a fire that got largely out of control. Of course, anyone can think of making something out of whatever they read, but that's how they interpret it. Some things there are just simply inappropriate for the world and all the people in there. If you listen to a @ CAPS2 and the singer or rapper starts cursing and disrespecting a race or gender when they haven't done anything to anyone, that would be pointless. Something like this shouldn't be allowed in the first place and it's bad enough to be done to another singer, but talking about a race or culture is inexcusable. Or if a writer writes a story about someone, say who just saved people's lives, saying they were a terrible person and did terrible things to people when they didn't know little about the person and have heard almost nothing of the story. In conclusion, in some cases people should have the right to take away something that is extremely offensive not only to them but to a large number of people. Or if the hardware can cause problems that shouldn't have started. And if the writing or the music is not suitable for a race or a culture, should it be removed. Everyone has their rights and if writing, music and videos demean them, they should have the right to remove them from access.

My take on this would be that they'll learn more about @ CAPS3 anyway, so why take @ CAPS3 off the shelves ? No, I don't think adult content should be censored. You know, when your baby girl or boy talks about what's in his hand, just take @ CAPS3 and say "@ CAPS1 your eyes can't stand". @ CAPS2 they're going to ask questions and @ CAPS2 they're going to start wondering, but they're still learning this stuff in school so what's the problem? If I had a kid, who had delved into my personal stuff and started asking questions, I would just tell him "@ CAPS3 is a mom and dad thing", then I would hide @ CAPS3 in a different place. from the one where I know they can't find @ CAPS3. I mean when you were a kid sure your parents would have yelled at you for walking into that room and throwing stuff in there but then again you would have yelled at them for @ CAPS3 when they grew up. So don't despair your kids for @ CAPS1 they've come across, you should learn how to hide your stuff better. I'm not saying I would have this stuff (why would I need @ CAPS3?) But, as a student looking to the future, I have an opinion. Now let's say you have a few magazines under your bed and your child sees them. @ CAPS2 they will start looking at them, and some words might come out, but that doesn't mean they did @ CAPS1, @ CAPS3 is the parents fault. Like I said before I would hide my things better but, again, I don't need this stuff to live a happy life, I have my kids and my husband and that's it. that I will need. So before your parents decide to protest that the library has things that kids aren't supposed to see, check your room, hide your stuff so you won't be embarrassed. No, a library can have whatever it wants, @ CAPS3 is not your place to say what they should get rid of and what should be left. you would like the adults here to complain and this is @ CAPS1 that we don't need.

The question was asked " Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive ?" "No ! By removing those things, such as books, music, magazines, or movies about yourself, that @ MONTH1 seems " offensive " to you are removing things that people appreciate. Few people, including me, would agree with passing censorship on articles like these. So should we do this, I don't believe we should. There are many reasons why this should not be adopted. Firstly, by using this censorship, you may lose more customers in that store selling these items. Once the store loses customers, they lose money and then they might even lose their store. A lot of people like things that have no limits. They often find their joy in these things. I know that I myself love reading books, listening to music that has no limits. So if you take them away or put limits on them, will people really want to have these things? Second, if there is really a problem with the books, etc., which are not suitable for children, put the books and etc. in categories. These categories would put things that are not suitable for children, outside of those that children should read. Since there are no real solutions other than banning these items, this would be the best plan. Finally, as Katherine Paterson said, " We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken away on their own ." If this is really a problem, then parents need to watch what their child is reading because it is not fair to take everything out of society just because parents care about what their child is reading. So what do you think, should it be such a law. The choice is yours. Remember though, if you're ok with that then. Just think about how much you take away from others, do you really want to be this heartless?

Censorship is a subject of great controversy today. Many authority figures have apparently become obsessed with the idea that literature, video games, movies, and music are responsible for the perceived corruption of today's generation. Many believe in the idea of censorship because it will protect their children and allow them to remain innocent and morally upright. However, I think censorship is a big mistake on our part. Denying children access to certain literary works only keeps them in ignorance and not in innocence; so many books are censored today, yet the information they contain could have been vital for children seeking to understand the world in which they live. One of the hardest questions about censorship is what should and shouldn't be censored. Books that are considered offensive or controversial are the usual targets, but viewing something as offensive is only a point of view. It changes from person to person due to the diversity of cultures, religions and moral codes. No one can agree on what will negatively impact children, making it impossible to establish a standard of what is best to leave out. The problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be allowed to read are not available. Censorship can protect a child from information that is best not to know, but it also robs them of a chance to acquire vital knowledge. Children should be encouraged to read and learn, not prevented from doing so. Yet, if this is really the case, why is the censorship debate still raging? The argument goes on because, in truth, there are things that really should be censored. Movies, music and even books today can be very violent or sexual in nature, and these inappropriate topics can have a negative impact on young people. Bloody video games and hate song lyrics can encourage animosity towards others in children. But that cannot be the only cause of such behavior; children will do well if they learn how, not if they are hidden from all evil. Censorship is far inferior to the proper life lessons on morality, equality, peace, and respect. Inevitably, censorship will remain common practice. But try this: think of a book that changed your life for the better, then imagine if you had been denied access to it. Do you want to let your kids miss out on an experience that could very well mean the world to them?

I believe that we can have materials because there are good materials which contain good things. Book yes, if we don't have a book, we can't leave. If we don't have a book, we know how to read. Music, I will say yes and no because sometimes music is not good, but sometimes people need music to do their jobs. I'll tell magazines because it's too much in there. This is thin stuff that @ CAPS1 shouldn't see.

No, I don't think some books, music, movies, magazines should be taken off the shelves. good book so no one will read it. Most people think rap music is bad, but it's the music most people listen to these days and hubs don't like country. There are some bad movies but they are fun to watch because out there ether funn, gross, or they are sad but bad movies are rude or funn. If people made better magazines they wouldn't have that much money then this business will disappear and that is not a good thing because the person who runs the business will not have the money to feed them. children. a good thing like books, music, magazines have changed because people don't like stuff from a long time ago. If they do it again, people will stop going to the movies and buying books, that's what I think. Now there are a lot of great movies and great music coming out, so if they brought back everything they had people would have more money. Why would people have more money because more people would go to see the movies of the old days. So like a movie like @ NUM1 and even @ NUM2 would make a lot of money. That's why I think they shouldn't take stuff out because that's how we lose money every hour. People use what they would do for movies or books and stuff that they use for drugs and stuff that can get them to jail and things

What I believe is that certain documents should be allowed on a shelf. The time it takes for an author to write a book is very long. It could be their passion to write, so why would you want to take that away. Each person has an opinion, which is allowed to have by freedom. The material in the libraries is sorted by age group, and as long as the material is suitable for that age group, there should be no problem. There are many books that some people don't want their children to read, but these books actually help children learn. For example, a book that you find boring might actually be interesting to another person. There are a lot of opinions in the world, which is why there are so many different kinds of books. If you took a book or some material off the shelf, how could that help a child. Yes, there could be some bad words or beliefs, but it might help someone. If a person is lonely or just likes being alone, they might learn from the character's mistake in the book. Many children these days are bullied or bullied and do not want to tell an adult about it. If there was a book they were reading about someone being bullied, maybe it would encourage them to tell a teacher about it. Yes, I agree, there is something in every material that another person doesn't like. There are a few books that I didn't approve of myself, but I know they relate to a child somewhere in the world. Not everyone grows up in the same conditions, but the material could teach them. You should stop and think that if you were a writer, would you want someone to throw your hard work in the trash? Whenever there is a large gathering about an author writing about a certain belief, there are negative thoughts. No one stops and thinks about someone else or their family. All they care about is their own family. Even the author's family are embarrassed by the gathering, but no one stops and thinks about their family and how they feel. Think about your opinion, does anyone care what you think? Therefore, as a person, we should not belittle someone's opinion and let them say what they believe on paper. How would you like someone to throw your belief or opinion in the trash ? If there is a gathering about a material in the library, think about it next time before judging. Would you like someone to judge your belief or opinion ?

A lot can be found to be offensive these days, but that doesn't mean you take it away from others who appreciate it. Everyone has their point of view and opinion on things. For things that people find offensive, I think they should just stay away. No, I don't think there are any documents that should be taken off the library shelves. Something the people at @ MONTH1 find offensive to others. It's simple, if it comes down to whether people are causing problems, maybe it will depend on the people who work in the libraries. Yes, there are a lot of things @ MONTH1 that people find offensive, but that doesn't mean to take away the things that other @ MONTH1 like. I have been to many libraries in my life. I haven't seen anything offensive, but I've seen adult-only books and movies. Honestly in my eyes it's simple, if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it because others @ MONTHS1 appreciate it. It is not for me to decide whether the documents should be removed from the library shelves. Although I think people who find things offensive should just stay away from it. You need to take things into consideration before jumping straight to conclusions.

This essay is about censorship for libraries, which they shouldn't be doing because a lot of that stuff is on TV like the comedy central, @ ORGANIZATION2. @ CAPS3, mtv and a lot of channels. should music be censorship, no, because blanks can ruin rhythms, rhythms and lyrics. Censorship ruins the flow of the song and it drives people crazy because they like a certain song, but if they want to listen to it, they have to log into a computer. The websites they can listen to are @ CAPS1, @ ORGANIZATION1, @ CAPS2 and many more. Movies shouldn't ethier, it's the parents who choose if they don't want the kids to watch or hear the things they don't choose or tell the kids to go to their rooms. Books!!! shouldn't i repeat shouldn't be censorship because if adults want to read them. It is not fair to them because it is all about the children. Kids are smart about it, they know what to read and what they shouldn't read. TV shows! It's the best thing of all their shows, it's funny, awesome, thriller and so much more. But it happens to you. Here is an example @ ORGANIZATION2, @ CAPS3 and more are playing a lot of good movies but since they blocked the words and parts of the movie it really doesn't make sense to watch it because its not parts that they have really seen and they have to go rent it or buy it. To see the film. Am I right? Whatever I'm saying, censorship ruins a lot of movies and music from TV shows and nobody wants that. It ruins people's entertainment and it's sad to see as actors, music writers, writers and many more devote a lot of their time to fans and to work. When they can be with their family !!! Well that's the end of my essay

There is material that some people find offensive and / or contains material that we do not want our young people to engage in. These items can include music, books, and movies, but I'll just give you a few of my thoughts on the matter. On media, like music and movies, there are item notes indicating the appropriate age for the music or movie content. Like movies, there are ratings like @ CAPS1 which means you have to be @ NUM1 or above to see it. @ NUM2 which is parental supervision or @ NUM3 and more. PG means you should have your parents with the younger ones. And @ CAPS2 which is aimed at all age groups. If there is anything offensive and / or the language is bad in the music, the cover art will have a label indicating explicit content. I agree with that. I don't think they should take anything off the shelf unless it's completely necessary. If someone does not like the content of this element, they have the option of not listening, watching or reading it. There are people who might disagree with me and I can also see where they are from. Let's say if there is a race discriminating book, I would agree to it being taken off the shelves. There are also people who are thinner and others who are more strict. Just like parents, for example. Many parents want to raise their children in an environment where there is no swearing and violence, while other parents let children watch and listen to articles of their age range. As with me, my parents let me watch, read and listen to whatever I want and in my opinion it went really well, while others might not think so. I've seen kids whose parents weren't strict and let them indulge in these things and they turned out to be well-behaved adults. Then there are also people from whom you had strict parents who turned out to be less good, and vice versa. That's about all I have to say on the subject. You have seen my opinions and what I believe. In summary, I guess I could say that everyone has their own opinions and views.

Have you ever seen a book, movie or magazine offend you? Have you ever wished no one else had to read it? Should these offensive materials be removed from libraries ? I don't think they should. Books, films, and other material should be marked with an indication that they @ MONTH1 are considered offensive. From my own experience, I know how easily one can be offended by a book or a movie. I have often read a book that completely contradicted my religion. Most of the time I will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie. Sometimes it's harder to ignore. I always try to forget and move on with my life, just like everyone else should. Have you ever read the book Le @ CAPS1? If you have any, you know that there are ideas in this book that raise a lot of controversy. An example from the book would be When They Kill Some of the Children. Most people, like me, disagree with this idea. They think it's wrong. Again some people @ MONTH1 are trying to get this book banned, but it's still wonderful literature. As you've seen @ MONTH1 in the media lately, a lot of people are trying to get the @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 book taken out of schools. Some people found the book offensive because it repeatedly referred to Native Americans by a deeper word. The law has not yet been adopted and has remained in schools. The law was not adopted because it does not concern everyone. Some people @ MONTH1 don't find this offensive. It was therefore not deleted. Removing offensive books from libraries is exactly the same. Some people @ MONTH1 find the books offensive while others @ MONTH1 are not. To take books out of everyone's reach would be appalling. The @ MONTH1 book is only offensive to one race or one religion. Why not just put a warning label for that race or religion? That would solve the problem by putting the decision to read it and be offended in their hands. It might not be that the books are offensive to any race or religion, it might be to an age group. If this is the problem, librarians can put these books in the appropriate age section. I have given reasons based on my own experiences, other reading, and my observations in the media. I only hope you consider my ideas. Do not remove books from the shelf just because it is offensive to someone. Just put a warning label on the book after a few complaints. It would put the responsibility of being offended in their hands. Again, I don't think offensive material should be removed from our libraries only censored to people whose offensive it is.

Everyone in @ LOCATION1 wants censorship. Mainly because they don't want to be the outcasts. This is understandable in the event that we have many different races in @ LOCATION1. In some ways censorship is necessary and in other ways some people just want attention. If all the different races want censorship, then why would we censor at the whim of one group of people? Essentially, the censorship problem will not go away because it is a chain reaction. For example, if a group of people asked a library to get rid of books because of the references they make, it might be insulting to another group of people. so that group of people wouldn't like a reference to another book that another group of people doesn't like, and it just goes on and on. So, for censorship towards different groups of people, there will have to be a certain tolerance. On the other hand, young children need censorship. They grow and mature every day, developing physically and mentally. So if we put an inappropriate book on them, they would read it and accept it as the standard. And when they read bad things like that, they develop bad goals and values for their future life. We are all different and interpret things in different ways. So when you watch a movie to listen to music and you mess up somebody around the corner @ MONTH1 thinks it's totally normal. If you question someone's movie or song, in the scheme of things, you question their judgment, and that's unfair to them

Books, music, movies, and magazines are things people use for entertainment and study, something everyone should have access to as well. If anyone is offended by any of these things, I don't think they should be taken off the shelves or from the ads. Many people will still find these books and other resources interesting. If the source is anything more adult, it should be placed in a section labeled or supported by information that says so. The radio stations play songs about sex, drugs, and violence, but I think kids need to be involved in these things. Parents cannot keep their kids away from all of this all their lives, and most of the bad things said are removed. Everyone has a different interest in the things that he or she loves. So why should you remove something from store or library shelves just because it is offensive to someone?

I don't think libraries should have to censor the kind of books, magazines, etc., because people should be allowed to read whatever they want. People don't necessarily like to read certain things, but if it's important for them to do research or read a book for school, then they need to have the resources available to them. Take the book @ CAPS1 in the @ CAPS2, for example. In this book, he describes the kidnapping and rape of young girls. Some courses would require you to read this book, although no one would really want to read about it. Some people have different tastes in the movies. Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not bloody ones) because they make me think about what's going to happen next. Some people like really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if libraries started releasing movies like this, it would be harder for these people to find them. Some people would find some things more offensive than others. Who can say where it must end? Movies that mock or talk about religion would be offensive to people of that religion, but people of other religions would not be affected. Just imagine looking at @ CAPS3 and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joke about it. It would really offend people, while others don't care. Basically I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something you don't want to see you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. It should not be spoiled for other people who would like to see it

Censorship in the media has been around since the start of @ ORGANIZATION1. Some of the early films were considered too offensive and never made it to theaters, but books, music, movies and magazines in libraries, how should they even be censored? Censorship of books should be if a book is not for children, keep them away. Extremely shocking books should be taken off the shelves or not put in a bookcase. A library is a place to learn or read for fun, and these very offensive books do not teach learning or are not entertaining. Music is something else. Most of the songs are very offensive and should be in a different section. They shouldn't be in the kids' music area because do parents really want their kids to learn swear words by age five ? Most parents don't want their kids to learn swear words and probably like libraries to get rid of music related to sex, drugs, and swearing altogether, all of which are censored in the media today. Maybe libraries can stream censored music instead of streaming music that is not censored. Movies are almost the same as music because they mostly represent what the music is in, but it's visual. Again, parents don't want to see drug use or inappropriate actions that force the child to copy what he sees and hears. Libraries should put films in the adult section of the library. They should be censored by placing a censor bar over the mouth of someone who swears or by placing the bar on the person's hand or anywhere when they do an inappropriate gesture. Over the years it has become more difficult to censor magazines. Magazines are impossible to censor unless you are the recipient of the magazine. If you are the libraries that receive the magazines, take a black marker and cross out any words or pictures that seem offensive. Libraries should not carry inappropriate magazines. If you are in a library and see something inappropriate, tell the librarian and see if he will censor the material in question.

Yes, I think there are some materials that should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive. Some people don't want to read about the things they are less interested in. Documents like these can offend many people, so they should be removed from public shelves. For example, someone, by accident @ MONTH1, stumbles upon a book with inappropriate material. They might take it home and start reading it, and find that the material they are reading contains information that offends them. It really affects some people and can hurt the library that held the book, and they might start to lose customers. Children are another reason why inappropriate material should not be posted publicly. What if a young child walks through a store or library and randomly picks up a book or magazine with offensive pictures ? This young child would see things he was not supposed to see. But, it does happen. Imagine how angry the child's parents would be. They would most likely do everything possible to have these materials removed from public display and out of the reach of a child. Children certainly don't need to see these things and even some adults don't even prefer them. Religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves. He @ MONTH1 be against some religions to read inappropriate material. And if they did not know that their book contained it and that they were reading it, they would be greatly offended and very upset. This could prevent many people from reading certain books, or even going to the store where they even purchased these materials. In conclusion, all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate documents should be removed to prevent people from being offended. This is why materials such as books, magazines, etc. should be removed from public shelves, as they may offend many people.

As Katherine Paterson once said, " We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves ." As an author, she believes that if she, and anyone else, has the right to take these uncensored books off the shelf, then there will be no more books. Depending on the person, some @ MONTH1 books may offend some, but not all. I don't think books should be able to be taken off the shelves by just anyone because everyone's preferences on books may be different. I think libraries should keep undetected books in a certain section, so that children can easily be prevented from viewing or reading material that is inappropriate for their age. And finally, my own experience has led me to believe that there should be a disclaimer on some books, saying that not all material may be appropriate. People with the right to take any book off the shelves would be unfair to people. The library is a quiet place, designed for people to come and read any type of book, do homework, study in groups, and research virtually any topic, @ CAPS1 the number of books based on l A person's opinion is unfair to everyone else who might appreciate this genre. Libraries and books were one of the main research resources before there was the Internet and many people still prefer books to this day. I think the freedom to take any book off the shelf would endanger the process of learning and discovery. To reduce the number of uncensored books found by children or people who find them offensive, there should be a certain section in the library for books. This way, people who are interested in these books can read them, but they are also kept away for those who don't want to read them. I think removing any kind of book is unfair to people because everyone likes different kinds of books so having uncensored books in one section is fair for everyone. It would also be easier for parents to know that their children won't find books with material they shouldn't be reading. Disagreeing with the right to take any book off the shelf, I think every book with uncensored material should be marked with some type of sticker on the binding, just as a warning. If someone sees this sticker and knows that they don't want books with this type of material, then they can easily flip the book without an argument. I used to try to find a book for a school project, but found out later that it contained material that was really not appropriate for the school. This forced me to find a new book for the project. I didn't want to take the book completely off the shelf and away from anyone who wanted to read it, but warning right away would have been easier in the situation. In conclusion, I don't believe there are certain materials that should be removed by just anyone. Carrying out books would cause a lot of disagreement, because even though one person might find something offensive, that doesn't mean all other people will. As mentioned earlier, placing uncensored books in a different section and affixing a sticker to the binder would give a clear warning to anyone who does not wish to read uncensored books. I think every library should take the above topics into consideration to help people reduce the problem of people or kids finding uncensored books in any section.

I don't really read books. I think offensive things should be taken off the shelves as there might be a feeling if they aren't. There are a lot of people who will fight if they are really offended and it is not a pretty sight.

I believe if I worked in a library, if I found several idems containing profanity, rasicm, slang, I would agree to take magazines, @ CAPS1, music books, @ CAPS2 books, etc. library and find racist books, etc. I would love to get more people to check out library books, but you couldn't if there were some inappropriate books. If I worked in a library and had to scan all the books to make sure they were acceptable for young adults, young children. How would you feel if I didn't do a book scan to check the books and one of your kids brought home an inappropriate book, how would you react ? I would comment on all the books we had in our library. I also think all libraries should have more inspirational books and cartoons, and baby books for little kids. I think if the majority of us all went to the library and found a bad book, I think we should have the right to take it off the shelf, not only would I not want my kids to see it , I wouldn't want someone else's kids to see. This is how I feel if my child picks up a bad, vulnerable book. I wouldn't let him go back to the library until he organized a library there. Finally, I think libraries should have a big room full of little children's books. Also i think they should have different age groups like baby room, book another room for @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 years and over. Hope this inspires you. Always read the spine of a book before you take it out of the library because you never know what the books will be about

Censorship in libraries has been a problem in communities for as long as literature has existed. As Katherine Paterson put it, if someone has the right to take a book off the shelf that they deem ineligible, then everyone has the right to remove the books that they deem ineligible. Everyone has an individual view of what is best, so @ MONTH1 doesn't leave any books on the shelf. In saying this, if the government censors documents such as books, music, films and magazines, nothing prevents it from banning everything in them. There's bound to be someone who wants a certain thing to be censored, but the @ MONTH1 government doesn't see it as something to be censored. This raises another question, what is it that considers something unacceptable to be seen ? In my mind, it's a matter of opinion, so should we leave something like that in the hands of the government to decide? I don't believe that books, music, movies, or magazines should ever be censored. It is the individual's choice to read, listen to or watch a certain material. The government's opinion on whether or not something should be censored has changed over time. The novel, " @ ORGANIZATION1's @ CAPS1 " was once censored and banned by the government because it contained language and scenes considered inappropriate for readers. If this work were to remain banned, this canon of American culture, the effect it has had on American literature to this day would have been lost. I see literature as another art form. Art should never be censored, because its absence will stop all developments in our society. Artists are risk takers and so are writers. If people weren't allowed to take risks, what would become of our society? Developments made by researchers, inventors, artists and writers were once viewed as risks. Should we have censored them? Another case in which censorship had a negative effect on society and culture was during the @ CAPS2 regime. Music, books, art, movies, everything was censored or banned under the @ CAPS3 rule. An entire generation was lost under his power, for they were deemed inadmissible simply because he did not like them. Now, should we put the power to choose what is unacceptable in the hands of a group of people? Entire generations of books, music, etc. could be in play under such principles. There should be no reason why we shouldn't be allowed to see, read or listen to anything we as a nation would like. The government, with the ability to censor libraries, can prevent our exposure to ideas that are unknown to us. Lack of exposure is the cause of a society's ignorance of the world around it. Who will stop the government from censoring what could be the next major literary masterpiece? Nothing stopped them from banning “ The @ CAPS1 of @ ORGANIZATION1 ”, so is there a limit ? This is the question that must be asked, to prevent the government from potentially cutting off the nation from future masterpieces.

Recently there was a censorship problem in libraries. Many books, films and music are taken from libraries because they are deemed offensive. There are, however, some libraries that do not remove items due to their offending nature. There are many reasons why items are or are not censored, but libraries shouldn't have to censor certain items. One of the reasons that offensive material should not be removed is that material deemed to be offensive might be given a label that alerts people to the material in the book or movie. If a child tries to read a book or movie with a warning label, they will need to be accompanied by a parent to approve the item the child receives. Whether or not the children read or see the offensive material is the decision of the parents. Another reason why offensive material should not be removed is that parents should approve of the item their child receives. If they think the material is too mature for their child, they might restrict them. If the item doesn't seem too dangerous, they might allow it. But that decision is up to parents. Books or films considered offensive could also be assigned their own section of a library. Children would not be admitted to this section without parental supervision. And that, again, is the decision of the child's parents. There are many reasons why offensive material should not be banned. This kind of material, however, should have restrictions on who should and should not view it.

Everyone has their own opinions and arguments on something. There are a lot of books that can offend people in some ways. There can be thousands of books in a library, and sometimes I have a hard time finding the right book that interests me. My personal opinion is that I don't think books should be taken off a shelf even though @ MONTH1 offends someone. As I said in the first paragraph, everyone has their own opinions. There are so many types of books on murders, romance, mysteries, drugs, and many more. These books should be placed in separate areas, as are many books. If the books are taken off a shelf, what does that mean to us the people ? Everyone has their own freedom. So if somebody's books have to be taken away, it takes away their individual freedom. There are also more books in a library. Whether it is books, movies, music, magazines, etc., they can all be of different types. I think they should just be placed in different areas. I can see where people think it can influence young children if they pick up something disturbing, but they should be with an adult. Adults know what is right and wrong than what children are doing. For example, whenever I walk in public places, I hardly ever see children running, especially in libraries. Libraries should be silent and not jump and scream. Children should be kept with their parent or an adult that way they can't catch anything they shouldn't. I understand that some teens may be offended by drugs or murder, in magazines or books, but some people like to read about that stuff. Does that mean we have the right to take it off the shelf because we are offended? Many think they have the right to do anything without negotiating with others. People who don't like this stuff should just give it up and continue with what they were doing. I can understand if you think there should be restrictions on certain things because I agree. There should be sections for teens, adults, and children. To me, that doesn't mean that we have to take anything away from others for offending someone. Libraries can have an effect on your daily life due to its calming and calming effect. You should be able to have freedom without taking anything away from anyone. Taking things away doesn't mean you just take one away, it means you take everyone away. You can have your own censorship in the libraries for your individual freedom. These are my personal opinions on why things shouldn't be taken off the shelves or whatever.

There are many, many arguments about book censorship and how it might affect children. Some people believe that offensive books should be taken off the library shelves. Others think they should be left up there for those who want to read them to do so. Some parents of children say their child has become more offensive to others, while others think it is just bad parenting. So you see that there are a lot of different statements about offensive things being said to their children. I think there are offensive things that need to be kept on the shelves and there are some that shouldn't. Some offensive items should be left on the shelves because they could teach children what is bad and what is not. Other items that have no reason to be offensive should be removed from the shelves. For example, there is music that talks about being extremely harsh and disobedient to others when that person has done nothing wrong. An example of offensive in a good way is the book '@ PERSON1'. The book @ CAPS1 showed just how bad slavery is and how it should never happen again. If there is a book or other material that is offensive in a good way ; I want to read it and understand what it is trying to portray to me. If it looks bad, it should be taken off the shelves. If it doesn't paint a bad image then I think it should be taught to children so that they can understand the effects and know the difference between right and wrong. Books that suggest harmful behavior towards anything aimlessly should be discarded. @ CAPS1 is because children reading it might join in with what the book suggests. This could then lead to bad consequences for that person or for someone else for that matter. I have witnessed stories where someone listened to bad music or read something bad and then was changed by it, but not in a good way. There have been incidents where this person did something illegal and then had to face the harsh consequences of that action. Then I also saw stories where people were changed for a good way because of a book. Personally, I was pleasantly surprised by the book '@ ORGANIZATION1'. Now I realize how bad it was towards people of color, so I behave nicely with them. because they are just as equal to everyone.

DELETING BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARY BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFENSIVE IS A GOOD IDEA. I DON'T AGREE BECAUSE THE BOOKS SHOULD NOT BE CLOSED. THERE SHOULD BE AGE LIMITS ON THE BOOKS. OFFENSIVE BOOKS SHOULD BE ALLOWED ONLY FOR ADULTS OR A CERTAIN AGE GROUP, THIS WILL HELP NOT FEAR CHILDREN, KEEP HISTORY AROUND AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH. BY ESTABLISHING AN AGE LIMIT ON CERTAIN BOOKS, WE CAN KEEP CHILDREN INACENT AND PURE. WITH BOOKS LIKE "@ DATE1" CHILDREN @ NUM1 OR LESS SHOULD NOT READ THIS BOOK. @ NUM1 AND UNDER ARE STILL NIEVE. LITTLE CHILDREN DO NOT KNOW SEX OR EVEN SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE. WITH @ PERSON1 AND IS A GIRLFRIEND HAVE SEXES EVERY OTHER CHAPTER, THIS IS VERY INAPPORABLE FOR A CHILD TO READ. ALSO, WITH ALL THE PARTS OF TORTURE, IT KILLED A LITTLE BOY / GIRL OUT OF HIS MIND. WHEN YOU DELETE OFFENSIVE BOOKS, WE DELETE THE STORY. THINK OF WHERE WE WOULD BE IF ANNE FRANK DIDN'T WRITE HER DIARY. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HILTER REALLY WAS. WE CAN ONLY ASSUME. TO GET OFF BOOKS, BECAUSE THEY ARE "OFFENSIVE" IS A RIDICULAR REASON. THE BOOKS ARE OFFENSIVE ONLY FOR THE SENATES. BOOKS KEEP HISTORY ALIVE! THINK, " WHAT ARE WE WITHOUT HISTORY ?" » FINALLY, FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS WHY IT SHOULD BE SAID. AUTHORS HAVE THE RIGHT TO WRITE WHAT THEY WANT. IF THE READER DOESN'T LIKE IT AND FIND IT OFFENSIVE, THEN THE READER MUST NOT READ IT. IF SHAKE SPEARE, IT WAS SAID THAT HE COULD NOT WRITE HIS STORIES, WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE TRAGETY OF ROMEO AND JULIET. SO MANY BOOKS WILL BE LOST IF ANYONE CAN WRITE BECAUSE IT WAS OFFENSIVE. A BOOK TOO OFFENSIVE OR INAPORIT FOR A CHILD THERE MUST BE AN AGE LIMIT. IF WE ELIMINATE SOME BOOKS, WE ALSO ELIMINATE SOME STORIES. SE HOLD THESE BOOKS TO SAY NEXT AUTHOR TO COME THAT FREE SPEECH HAS NO IMPORTANCE FOR THE OFFENSIVE. THEN KEEP THE BOOKS AROUND, HIS ONLY WORDS

Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on the shelves @ CAPS1. They claim that these books may be offensive to some and therefore should not be read. These books are known as " Books @ CAPS2 ". @ CAPS3, librarians and government officials have gone too far in believing that they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not. In the novel To @ CAPS4 a @ CAPS5, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find very offensive. These words are however essential to the staging of the novel. The author is not claiming that she personally thinks that @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 should be described as they are, but a racist individual, like @ PERSON3 or many people during the period, would not hesitate to describe them as 'such a way. path. The novel, To @ CAPS4 a @ CAPS9, is a great way for people to understand the history of @ CAPS10. Without the descriptions in the novels, a piece of history would be unknown to many. The novel, @ PERSON4 in @ CAPS11, attempts to delve into the life of a pubescent, whiny teenager. The author, @ PERSON2, uses many curses in the dialogue between the characters. The characters, however, are high school students who live in a boarding school. Watering down the language or making the novel “ kid friendly ” would make it impossible to describe the characters' true nature. The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations. These situations, while offensive to some, are necessary to show the plot's progression as well as the changing character traits of the protagonist, @ PERSON1. Literature is not the only medium targeted by those who attempt to censor libraries completely. Music, movies, magazines and video games are also targeted. In many cases, some materials should not be seen by young children or by those who are not mature enough to handle them. Keep in mind that it is @ CAPS3's responsibility to censor material for their children. Cases of violence, prejudice and death are a diurnal event. @ CAPS1 clients should not be protected from these events. In conclusion, it is often necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many. Librarians should not have control over the materials that arrive on library shelves. Libraries should present to the public a wide variety of books, films, etc. If libraries do this, it becomes the responsibility of the @ CAPS3 or the individual to choose books that fall within personal limits.

Literary works are literary works, whatever they contain. All literature should be placed on the shelves of a library. If for any reason the material is offensive or considered raw, it should be placed in a restricted section where permission is required to enter. Literature is a strong element in persuasion. It is therefore necessary to pay attention to what one lets out or to see and to which eyes. Literature is written by the author for many reasons. Maybe the reason is to earn money or share a point of view, but in any case, the author generally wants his literature to be read. How would the author ever achieve his goal if we decided to remove his hard work from the library shelves. It just couldn't be read if it wasn't available. This is one of the reasons why some books should not be completely removed from the library. It doesn't matter how necessary an @ MONTH1 or @ MONTH1 subject is always for some people. If there were pictures of a naked person in a science book that librarians didn't want kids to get their hands on, then how would students study a subject like sex education or anatomy for? a class ? Of course, there are people who just want to see nudity for crazy fun and that's why permission should be required to get these books. A small, closed room in a library should be sufficient to contain all the books deemed to be gross. That way the only access to the books would be to get a key from a librarian. An unread book @ MONTH1 like this has never been written. There is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some @ MONTH1 feel offended. The simplest solution would be to just make the only people who see these books want or need to see them. We just can't lose some writing because some parents don't trust their child's eye or someone @ MONTH1 is offended by the material. After all, when everyone has a chance to say what is offensive, there will be no more books left.

Everyone has their own opinion on certain things in life. Perhaps his policy; it could be a sports team. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. When it comes to documents to read, opinions could be endless and even painful to hear. Opinions on some books and media-type materials are biased. People could often be offended by documents accessible in a public library. For example, let's say a grandmother and her grandson are at the public library. The grandchild takes a self-help book and begins to read. Later, the grandmother reads it and finds that it says the exact opposite of what the grandchild learned about life from herself and her parents. For the grandmother, @ CAPS1 is offensive. Through observation I have noticed that a person takes "an offensive book" and reads a little of it, tends to put it back where they found it. It is obviously not difficult to do. So why take a book out of a library when all you have to do is put it down and leave it? The same goes for music, movies and magazines. If you don't like music, don't listen to it. If you don't think this would be a "beautiful" movie, don't go out and see it. If the magazine looks scorching, don't buy it. @ PERSON1 put it right, that if we remove all the offending books from the shelf "... then we have no more books on the shelf for any of us." The @ CAPS1 instruction is as true as any instruction could be. What would remain? Everyone has an opinion, and it's likely that someone will always find it offensive. Therefore, offensive books and media should be allowed to remain on the shelves. Whether or not you find a book, movie, music, or magazine offensive, why worry ? It's just easier to move on and forget about it. Ignorance is not that bad

Taking the books off the shelves won't change anything. If I saw a book and knew I wasn't supposed to read it, I knew it was good music, a book, or a magazine. I would get it because it's what kids explore. the books are there to read and watch, I think if you know I'm not supposed to read it show me an age teacher or don't give it to me. I really don't understand why the sum books are in the stores and people don't want you to read them. In short, children don't read at all and to see them pick up a book, @ CAPS2 for reading should be good. But there is always an age group that is not supposed to read certain books. But at that time, you cannot keep the child away from the world and what it brings to you. The book is put there for a reason and not just to be walked past. I feel like the reason kids listen to music is that at some point the song relates to them in a way that another person wouldn't understand. So they feel the song differently than what another person would hear just on @ CAPS3, @ CAPS4, @ CAPS5, and @ CAPS6. This is not what parents want you to hear. Magazines tell a lot and show a lot for young minds. I am a father myself and would like my son at the age of @ NUM1 to look at any girl naked or add about pron in the books @ ORGANIZATION1 or anything like that. parents can sometimes be too hard on a child and not let him or her do a lot of things. But they think they know what's best for you. What they tell you is not wrong because @ MONTH1 has already experienced it. It would only get them to do things behind them. But if they want to learn the easiest way, it's the hard way.

When you go to the library you @ MONTH1 have a lot of choices for reading books, watching movies, or listening to music, and sometimes you may have offensive words or abusive language that is unsuitable for your children. Students should have the right to remove the book from the library if it is offended, or sometimes if there is a student who is from another @ CAPS2 and they might be offended by the movies or music that can be found in the library. Books are most often used in the library. In these books, there is a book that is offensive to a student, and if a student finds anything offensive, they should have the right to remove the book from the library shelf. Many students like fiction books, which are true stories but may have some sort of offensive language or something that the student feels racist towards them. The school or any public library should remove books with inappropriate words that are not good for the children in their lives to learn. Music is also one of the important things that is carried in any school library or any public library. The most common type of music that you can find in the library is @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2, or @ CAPS3 music. Most of the time, these types of music may not contain swear words, racism, or any other offensive language, but some songs may contain something that is not appropriate for school use. These genres of music should be removed from any school library or public library. Films are also transported to some libraries, but not all libraries contain a film. Some movies may contain scenes of blood, abusive language, which may not be suitable for some school children. You should check the rating of the movie you are checking out from the library or if you are watching it at home or any other place. Movies can contain some kind of racism. The library is a good source for reading books, listening to music, or watching a movie. As you read a book or watch a movie, you might come up with words that might not be appropriate for yourself or the students reading these books. These movies, books or music may convey abusive language or something dangerous for some people coming from a different @ CAPS2. The student should have the right to delete anything that is not appropriate for school use, such as books, music, and movies, if they contain anything that is not meant to be there. , you must delete it

A lot of people are offended by things that are not censored. Some think they should be censored and some do n't. It's all a matter of opinion. I don't think anything should be censored because it infringes on freedom of expression. With censorship, you cannot fully express yourself or express your opinion. this is how nothing should be censored

I strongly disagree with the idea of removing all material from public shelves. Books, magazines, and the rest of the material are based on the author's and musician's experiences and observations. With the population of readers in the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I don't think removing the books for what they might contain would negatively impact people like a ditch. The world needs its materials. The author of the book writes about his Observations and his own personal experiences in life. The @ CAPS3 put so much in it why take it off because someone doesn't like the way a part is worded. Movies that are rated as bad probably just have a swear word or a scene where there is a little blood. Lots of people like to make a big deal out of nothing. I seriously think that some parents think that if their child here does a bad job or sees a small pool of blood, he will end up in jail. Then there is the music. The public believe that children should not be exposed to music like rap and hip-hop. I'm okay with that, but I also don't see if it's Christian rap or if it's a clean song what's wrong with that. A musician is not only paid for his incredible skills with an instrument, but also for the way he connects with the listener. I really don't see any reason to remove any form of material from the shelves. The artist who produces it is entitled to his own opinion. The audience that I feel is doing a big deal with nothing. The smallest problems do not name the material as the reader hears the artist's work

Where he @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 nobody wanted to read, it's too hard or I don't want to. The best way to get out of reading was to read a magazine. Of course, it's educational, but it can also demoralize the thoughts and feelings of some people. One way to get rid of this problem is by censoring or removing a specific book from the public. We've all made fun of people, whether it's to hurt them or just give them a hard time, it can hurt people. Same thing with the media. Books, magazines, @ LOCATION1 and the internet are all competing for the success and money of its viewers, and the best thing to do is to please the public. Give them what they want. For some reason everyone wants to demoralize people, and this is where I think it's @ CAPS1 the @ CAPS3. Stand up for your rights and censor those things that will lead to a worse life for those to come. Censorship @ MONTH1 is just a big word for most people, but it's a big problem. To me it's @ CAPS1 the @ CAPS3 whenever racism is an issue or vulgarity is an obscene message. The music we listen to can get really intense. I am a victim of the hard music that we play more and more today. At least the radio tries to do better every time it " beeps " swear words or persuades the artist to speak loudly to air. This is where places try to clean things up. Make tomorrow a better place than today. With all of these new @ CAPS5 (Music @ CAPS6) shows and other reality sitcoms airing on @ CAPS6, it's opened the door to rudeness everywhere. They try to do a better job of cleaning up in the sense of the picture, censoring body parts and covering stations globally from their mouths. Other stations like @ CAPS5 do nothing against the voices and vulgarity that people show and feel towards each other. Books are another thing that could use some censorship. The teacher at @ CAPS2 was telling me "@ CAPS8, if you can't read it aloud to me then you probably shouldn't read it." and I agree. With technology and all the other things, children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions. Thus, leading to a society that cannot be trusted and that easily turns vulgar when needed. With today's world, it is quite easy to listen to the uncensored version that is broadcast on the radio. One person tries to make tomorrow a better place, but the next one tries to demoralize him. It's one thing if you're angry and upset and standing up for your rights, but it's not every time you do it for fun. This is where he @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3

Censorship is a two-sided issue. There are people who believe that everything should be left as it is written. While others think topics that are offensive should be deleted. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some of the reasons one can think of when deciding whether the censorship is fair or not. What is too offensive for a student to read ? In the story, a lot of things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone, how can students learn more about the past? If students cannot learn about the past, then the past is linked, it repeats itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment so what's wrong with someone reading a murder book if it's just for entertainment ? There are books that should be kept so that students can learn to their full potential. If books are censored, it takes away a person's right to free speech. It limits creativity and wonder. If some books are taken off the shelves of a library, then the books that are famous now @ MONTH1 have never been read. Books, even if they are offensive, can show someone thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world. People everywhere are learning from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do differently for the future. A lot is learned from books every day and if some books are taken out there will be things that will never be learned because someone thought the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past to learn. The past is the best teacher and when the past is gone, there is no way for these students to learn more about the past. Having books that are said to be offensive can help a lot @ MONTH1. All books must remain on the shelves. No matter what the book is about, a student can learn from it. If the book is something that a student does not learn, it does not need to read. Much can be learned from books and without books it cannot and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come.

Libraries contain thousands and thousands of books and other materials. In these books, magazines and films there is a lot of knowledge, information in the selection of non-fiction and many entertaining morals in the selection of fiction books. If libraries started censoring their books, a lot of information would be leaked so that no one could read it. The government could have several reasons why it thinks certain books should be taken off the shelves. Some possible reasons could be that they are racist, send the wrong message to children, or spread knowledge that @ ORGANIZATION1 wants to keep away from the common man. To praise books would be a horrible idea and would affect everyone. Some books that could easily be considered taken off the market would be books that are racist or suggest radical ideas. Everyone in the world is deemed equal and books which suggest that one race is better than another might offend readers and for which @ ORGANIZATION1 decides to take it off the shelf. Books that suggest radical ideas could also belong to the group of books pulled from the shelves. @ ORGANIZATION1 might fear that reader @ MOIS1 will implement this radical / terrorist idea and censor them in return. But to censor these ideas would be depriving the public of their chance to learn, there are racists everywhere and just because you just throw the book away, will not suddenly rid the world of racists. Another reason that @ MONTH1 books or magazines are taken off the shelves may be because they send the wrong message to children or contain vulgar content. Parents do their best to push their children's content away, and the books they start reading, whether alone or at school, might introduce children of all ages to new content, their parents @ MONTHS1 don't prefer that they learn at their own pace. age. Parents @ MONTH1 are right but children cannot be protected from everything they have to learn and come to terms with certain ideas as they grow and develop. Parents @ MONTH1 can censor what their children read in their own home, but removing books or movies entirely from the shelves would prevent people who love or see comedy in those articles, movies, music or books from learning to acquire skills. knowledge, even if their sole purpose of reading is just for fun. Censorship of @ MONTH1 is also introduced to libraries because @ ORGANIZATION1 does not want the public to learn and develop ideas about what they think is the right idea to do something that @ ORGANIZATION1 is not suitable for. OK. They @ MONTH1 think that if people start to learn and develop opinions from books they have read, they @ MONTH1 start to oppose @ ORGANIZATION1, although people will always oppose @ ORGANIZATION1, Not everyone will like what is happening, and to have a growing society and economy, skilled people are needed to invent and develop concepts. In terms of race and religion, everyone is considered equal, but in terms of @ CAPS1 level, everyone varies from each other. Which could be another reason to censor, to keep the public on par with their neighbors, so everyone is really equal. Doing this would stop the modernization of the world once again, intelligent people would not be recognized, and inventions that might have stirred in their heads could turn into an empty thought, which is the same as everyone else's. In the book @ CAPS2 @ NUM1, censorship is the main idea of this book. They censor books to make everyone truly equal, and even censor so that people’s appearance and qualities are all equal to others. This is not the way to go in @ CAPS3 society. The @ ORGANIZATION1 would have full control, and knowledge would not flourish in schools. Even a little censorship in libraries, be it books, magazines, music or movies, would dampen the knowledge and brain power of the surrounding society. Censorship of books is a terrible idea that should never be implemented. The @ ORGANIZATION1 should never be allowed to decide what the public sees. It is in everyone's opinion and interest to read or listen to the material provided for themselves.

There are a lot of things in the " material " world that offend people. Either way, there are always people out there who have to be against anything, whether it's a book, a song, or a movie. But they have no idea what they are doing when they talk about their " rights ". If they happen to say that they are offended by a certain media product, not only are they announcing that they have the right to try to have it banned, but they are giving to people who do not find offense in the material. to distribute the same. If they can remove something from the shelves that they “offend” then everyone @ CAPS4 is entitled to it. Another thing is that they pretend to find the song, book or movie offending, but if it bothers them that much, they just shouldn't listen / read / watch what @ CAPS5 they are feeling. insulted. It would be that simple, just change the radio station, grab another book or watch another movie. Another thing that "offended" people can try is to be open-minded. It would make everything much less dramatic. People who say they have offended @ MONTH1 material usually use the phrase "@ CAPS1 this is offensive and I don't want my child to fall on it". They say they have the right to take any “offensive material” that is in the store and hide it from the public. They couldn't be more righteous and stupid at the same time! If they have the right to remove a certain thing from the shelf, then @ ORGANIZATION1 (the author of the song / book / movie) can claim that he @ CAPS4 has been offended by a song / book / a movie that the first person likes. Then it's just a knockout move to get everyone to start taking everything off the shelves, one by one. Everyone @ CAPS4 has the same rights, and if the first offended person uses them to bring down @ ORGANIZATION1, then @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS4 has the right to do the exact same. So the government shouldn't let things be taken off the shelves, because if they take one off, they could as @ CAPS1 take everything else off with it. So if someone takes offense to a song they hear on the radio and is convinced that they want it removed from the radios and any place where music is played, then he needs help. When they find this song SO offensive, then there is only one easy solution: move the radio on! Seriously, if someone finds the song offensive, then why is they going to sit there and listen to the whole song? Or if they find a book offensive. Am I going to sit down and read an entire book if I don't like the content ? Uh no. If someone is offended by anything, then they just need to do something else, as it's pretty ridiculous to waste more time trying to ban the song or the book than just changing the radio or finding another book. So if you are complaining about the song or the book, just turn your attention to something else, because every song, book or movie @ CAPS4 has the right to be sold. On a light note, they might just have an open mind so that the song, book, or movie could still be sold. They can try to read the book to see if there is a reason why author @ CAPS4 wrote it this way. If they conflict with a movie, they should just watch it and test it out to see if they really need to get it off the shelf. Or if they listen to the song, listen to it all the way, or maybe even twice. The artist who sang the song maybe spoke very deeply, and if someone removes their song from the radio or where @ CAPS5 is playing, then someone might be offending them. in return. Having an open mind will allow the so called " offended person " to see a whole new light on why the " offending material " was even created. So everything can stay on the shelves! People have opinions, and that's absolutely correct. But sometimes people think their opinions are the only ones that matter. If some people are offended (or think they are offended) by something, they would try to remove whatever it was from the nation's stores. But if they just sit back and think about it, then everything will be fine. If they have the right to take anything off the shelves, everyone does too. If this song @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 really offends them, they should just change the radio station and forget about it. And if they're open-minded as to why things are still "out there," then all the songs, all the books, and all the movies will still be on the shelves for people to buy. I don't approve of removing anything from stores just because someone feels like if they don't like it, then it's absolutely @ CAPS4 to go. No, their world doesn't just revolve around one person, and it never will, @ CAPS5.

Controversy in the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 someone enters the public @ CAPS1 they are inundated with books. Even though a person could never read so many books, the @ CAPS1 must have a wide selection, for people who read different things. The @ CAPS1 should not get rid of the books that have offended some people. @ CAPS1 is a public place where people can read whatever they want. If someone doesn't agree with what another person is reading, they shouldn't be there. Since @ CAPS1 is a public place, people can't just throw a book away because it's offensive. Just like Katherine Paterson said, "And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us." If everyone threw out offensive books, there would be no more books. It would cause a lot of people to stop reading and learning. The public @ CAPS1 is open to anyone to read a book. With this in mind, the @ CAPS1 should have books that appeal to everyone. If they only had one type of book, not many people would want to go to @ CAPS1. the @ CAPS1 offended some people to please others. People who go to @ CAPS1 go there because that's where they choose to pick up a book. If people find the @ CAPS1 offensive books, they don't have to go. Books that people find offensive are on the shelves for those who want to read them. If someone finds a book offensive, they don't have to read it. Libraries should have as many books as possible, so that they can appeal to all tastes. They shouldn't get rid of books that have offended a small group of people. These people do not have to read books that they find offensive. Libraries are a public place where everyone can read what they want.

Personally, I believe that items that are found to be offensive should be left on book shelves. People who find them offensive don't need to read them, they can just ignore them and move on with their lives. Students @ MONTH1 must use certain information in a classroom. If libraries remove information from the library, students will not be able to find the information needed for their project or article. Students will eventually learn all about these offensive magazines, movies, music and books one day in their life. If offensive books are taken out, where else will they go, they will still be offensive elsewhere. Libraries that have offensive books are in no way trying to offend anyone, they are on the shelves for the education of the reader or viewer. If the movies are so shocking, don't rent them and save yourself and the libraries some time. People are offended by all this reading from a certain library, if the library chooses not to remove the books from the shelves, then go to another library. In addition, the Internet will more than likely contain all equally offensive information. Internet is a virtual library, you can search for videos, books, magazines and music. If people think they are getting rid of books, magazines, etc. offensive, they are wrong because the Internet will keep this information for as long as it takes. Censorship of libraries is unnecessary because of the information provided on the Internet. Libraries should be able to choose the books and information they have in their building. As long as these books, music, magazines, films, etc. are placed in the correct section. Movies that parents don't want their children to see @ MONTH1 go to the wrong section of the library. From this perspective, you can see why parents get mad about inappropriate items on the shelves. Books should be divided so that children have their own section of the library and adults also have their own section. Most of these offensive articles are not placed in libraries because of this problem with the offended people. Movies that are also offensive should probably be in a movie store that claims the movies are offensive and may be inappropriate. Maybe people overreact to the situation and don't realize that the movie, book, etc., is not offensive enough to discuss it. Personally, I have never been to a library and seen a book, magazine, movie, song that was offensive to me or my family. What does an offensive book look like? More than likely, it has something to do with religion, ethnicity, etc. from someone. The articles are only offensive to certain people. If you or someone you know is greatly offended by a book, song, magazine, or movie in a specific library, don't go back or tell the person you know about it either. In conclusion, if a book, a movie, etc. is so offensive in a nearby library, avoid that library and don't worry about going back. Offensive material could also be learning material

Yeah, I think so because everyone has an opinion to say and it's something people like to watch or learn. Now, it would be different if it was a kids bookstore, like they had music like christin bible songs or cartoon movies in the store, but no adult stuff. I really don't see the big deal if they go out because everyone likes to read something different. I think as long as you read what it matters what it is or as long as you learn something. I don't think you can put out stuff like movies and magazines because people like to read it too much or learn music. So no matter what or where they go if you ask me               

<START>

 

@ CAPS2, I think books, music, movies, magazines etc should be taken off the shelves if they are offended. People shouldn't post stuff there if they make other people feel unhappy with what they're doing. However, we might think that putting stuff in the newspapers and in the movies doesn't hurt people. Well guess what they do @ CAPS1 of all movies that are all about sex. For example, marriage of the sexes, they say that people should not marry the same sex. They laugh at them because they are not like the others and they can take it very offensive. Very few people like to be with the same sex. Putting them in books, movies, or songs to make them feel offensive isn't the best way to go. Another is about special needs, movies or books that have to deal with people who demean those with special problems. While they don't show it's sad, that doesn't mean we haven't offended them in some way. Families who have a child, sister, brother, mother or father with special needs don't like it very much when someone reveals something about their problem that they have @ MONTH1. Plus, they will feel really upset and can get angry at times for it. Most importantly, books or movies poking fun at people who don't have a lot of stuff. It's not their fault that they don't have the money to buy stuff like the others. For example, a nice house or nice clothes, most families find it difficult to pay rent and other bills if only one parent is working. Many working parents are made redundant and are not even paid for it. Worse yet, a family member (like someone who lives in the house) @ MONTH1 has to go to the hospital and when you go to the hospital you have to pay the bills. Some families come in and out of the hospital year after year and they don't have the money to pay for new items for the house or the people who live there. In conclusion, @ CAPS2. I believe they should remove certain books, movies, mafazines, etc. from the shelves because they may be offended. We don't know how rude it is to have something laughing at someone until it's too late. A lot of people really don't like it when they see something that offends them. They don't know how to react and they are frustrated

Books should be read, not taken down because of what they say. That to me that's stupid, do children live in a world of war and fear every day what a fucking book is going to change ? Nothing over there is going to hear the f word and see blood and blood. Rather, would you like to see them for the first time in real life and not know what to do. Music is something that can bring everyone together. So because kids can't hear some of it, we push them to become pussies. Maybe there are just real people telling the truth that you don't want your child to hear. Movies are something people love to watch so we pay @ MONEY1 to be able to watch them sometimes. Are the kids going to be better because their parents didn't want them to see the new horror movie that they would see in real life someday, why not now ? Parnets you are not doing us a favor by not letting us see the real world YOUR @ CAPS1 US @ CAPS2 because when we get into this real life situation we wont know what to do so we have been screwed.

No one should believe that we have a choice to take books off the shelves of a library. America is a free country and we can write whatever we want. Everyone has free speech, just take this amendment and put it in music, books, or a movie. When you're looking for a book and find one that looks offensive, just put it back on the shelf and move on. Everyone has seen a lot of things that are offensive to races and creeds. You hear jokes that are offensive but that's all a joke is and it's not to be taken seriously. I recently read a book called '@ CAPS1's your @ CAPS2' it wasn't what I thought so I just put it down and picked up another book and kept reading. If everyone could pull books out of a library just because it was offensive, would we have any books at all? Films have protection against this phenomenon called rating. Ratings range from '@ CAPS3 to @ CAPS4.' If the movie you are watching is more oriented towards the @ CAPS4 section, it will contain more offensive language and violent scenes. This is why there is always a blocked section in a DVD rental store. This section is intended for mature people of age @ NUM1 or older. If by any chance your child gets lost in it and finds something that doesn't suit him and you are really excited, think of @ CAPS1 let him wonder in this section. @ CAPS1 should watch him at all times, @ CAPS1 is responsible for him ? I don't agree that reading material or anything in that area should be taken off a shelf. It's like saying if someone didn't like the way @ CAPS5 in @ CAPS6 was worded, they could just pull it out and throw it away. We wouldn't have anything to read. So next time you see something offensive just put it back and move on.

Censorship in libraries has become strict, causing the next generation to miss key lessons learned about life. How would you feel if you went to the library and as an adult could only browse children's books, magazines, and music ? Now I know it's a little extreme, but seriously what are we without knowing it ? Where would we be if there were no more books, magazines or music? No library is no knowledge, no books, no life lessons, no imagination and above all no excitement. we would go back to our animal state because in reality we humans only have one thing that has given us the power to become so advanced and intelligent, our brains. There was once a quote that I live my life by, it was like that "if knowledge is power, then books must be the way to get that power." From my own knowledge and worldviews, I will give you my argument on censorship and its effect on libraries. Censorship, what do we all think of when we Americans say censorship? I think of bad things like swearing, nudity, and battle scenes. The thing about these is that they are displayed in different ways such as music. an example of uncensored music would be rap. go ahead get the explicit version of this rap song or sometimes that can be bad enough already. Personally, I don't like rap so this opinion is biased, I rather like rock and metal. people love music and that takes away our freedom, if you don't like what they say don't listen to it. Another topic of interest when we talk about censorship issues is that of magazines. We have all at some point seen or learned about naughty magazines like Playboy. Now I'm all for these kinds of magazines to stay out of school libraries, but public libraries should have their own adult sections where we could not put playboys but stuff like hunting magazines or magazines. of hot rod lining the shelves of the adult sections. The last thing that comes under pretty extreme censorship is books. Let's be honest, we all had a favorite book when we were little or growing up. One of those books that is an absolute classic is " The @ CAPS1 of @ ORGANIZATION1 ", it is currently being deleted because it contains like one or two swear words. I mean, really folks, this is a great book, but at the first sign of a curse everyone starts screaming, burn it. Now, many of the following generations will never be able to read this classic because people took it out of libraries. I think people should learn to relax and not worry about a bad word or two because apparently that's all it takes to ruin a good book. So what's my final conclusion? when does our first amendment right to free speech with censorship and too much censorship meet ? Apparently in libraries where you can't read @ ORGANIZATION1, wood crafts, or listen to music that involves profanity. In my personal opinion, I think adults should have their own uncensored section, teens should only have censorship on things like nudity, and kids they are right about this, no censorship is needed. . So I ask you, whoever is grading my essay, to stop and think with an open mind how long are you hiding your children or grandchildren from the real world. In the real world these things are considered okay if they weren't okay they wouldn't be there to begin with. Really, if you decide to release classics like @ PERSON1, we not only lose knowledge and history, we lose our freedom.

Yes, some documents like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are shocking. Yet, they should not be taken off the shelves. The first reason is : @ CAPS1 some people find it shocking, others not. Reason number two is : the “ offensive ” material will be @ CAPS6 in the world. And finally, if parents don't want their children to read offensive material, they should only prohibit their children from reading it and not the rest of the world. In @ CAPS2 the following essay, I will explain in detail my reasons for having an opinion as such. '@ CAPS1 is one man's trash is another man's treasure.' The quote @ CAPS2 goes very well with the first reason: @ CAPS1 some people find it offensive, some don't. People's opinions on everything could be very different. For example, a book about @ PERSON1 killing @ CAPS3 might be offensive to someone with @ CAPS4 descent, while a book full of profanity might be offensive to a religious person. As you can see, “ offensive ” is defined differently by different people. Offensive material will be @ CAPS6 in the world. Parents cannot protect their child from these things forever. At some point in their lives, children will learn shocking things and parents will not be able to do anything about them. Children have an active mind that captures everything around them. If they learn from these offensive documents, parents should teach them that @ CAPS1 is wrong and @ CAPS1 is right. Finally, if parents do not want their children to read offensive material, they should only prohibit their children from reading it and not the rest of the world. The @ CAPS2 reason fits perfectly with the first. Parents cannot decide @ CAPS1 what parents of other children should do. They can only do something about @ CAPS1 that their children are doing. Therefore, my belief in censorship in libraries is non-existent for the following reasons. @ NUM1.) @ CAPS1 some people find it offensive, others not. @ NUM2.) Offensive material will be @ CAPS6 in the world. And @ NUM3.) If parents don't want their children to read offensive material, they should only prohibit their own children from reading it and not the rest of the world. So there should be no censorship in libraries

Should we censor documents in libraries? Some people think that some books, magazines, and music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene. This could be a major problem if people were allowed to say what is too obscene to put in a library. Katherine Paterson makes a good point, saying that if everyone were allowed to remove books, magazines, and music from the shelves that they find inappropriate, there would be nothing left for us. Books have been around for centuries. They are transmitted, shared and appreciated by people around the world. Books contain important information, stories and accounts from people's past. Therefore, I don't think there are some books that should be banned from libraries. By removing books from libraries, you take away the author's freedom of expression. Also, technology is advancing rapidly and in the future I think libraries will be phased out. With all the new devices we have @ DATE1, people can just get their books online. Magazines are a great tool for advertising and talking about some of the major topics happening in the world. Magazines are a great thing to read when you want to stay on top of the news, sports, or just other miscellaneous topics. Having said that, magazines can also be bad for public libraries due to some explicit content. This is one reason why some people would like to get rid of magazines from libraries, but I don't think they should be banned. By getting rid of magazines, you are infringing on the company's press freedom, which is a major issue. Referring to the previous paragraph, technology is developing and it is very easy to go just check out the news, sports and other topics on @ CAPS1. That's why I don't think magazines should be taken out of libraries. My last discussion is music. Music has also been around for many centuries, and it has done a lot. Music is something that everyone can relate to. No matter who you are, you probably have a favorite band, music artist, or genre of music. In saying that, I also don't think that music should be taken out of libraries. Removing music is like taking away the natural culture of humans. We all like it, but have different versions that we like. Therefore, I don't think it would be wise to remove music from libraries. In conclusion, libraries are nothing without all the history, stories, news and music in them. Censoring libraries would not be a good idea and would probably upset a lot of people. It is true that with technology, @ MONTH1 libraries will eventually disappear. Until that happens, I hope they don't censor their documents.

Most people wonder whether or not to stop distributing books, movies, music, magazines, etc., if they disturb other people's lives and offend them to the point of becoming furious and confusing. the peace. I also think that a lot of people complained about violence in the community due to several books, music etc. disturbing. But I have to say that most people live or are entirely influenced by what they read or hear. I think this accomnomy should recover on her own and learn to live her life. Personally, I don't think anyone should be punished for what is put on the shelves in libraries, stores, like music for example. I don't think other people who actually like to read and listen to this stuff, if they are happy then too bad then they are happy. I don't think people who really enjoy reading and hearing what is disturbing to other people should be punished just because someone else doesn't like what they hear or read. Why should things that bother others be removed when they don't harm anyone or anything. Personally, in my opinion, that would not be fair. because in my experience I don't think people should complain. What is in these stores only makes us stronger.

Most movies, magazines, music, and books are considered offensive to at least one person in this world. These materials often fall victim to censorship and are challenged daily to be banned, especially books. Mothers and fathers have the right to ban such materials, but they do not have the right to ban all children in the world. Whatever the reasoning, the censorship is wrong. This restricts the writer's @ ORGANIZATION1, the reader's @ ORGANIZATION1 and, as Katherine Paterson rightly put it, would result in "no books on the shelf for any of us." @ CAPS1 to @ ORGANIZATION1 everyone has freedom of speech and freedom of the press. This does not exempt writers or artists who occasionally, or more than occasionally, include explicit content in their works. In every book there is a message that the writer is tired of telling his audience. How they get this message across is their own business, and they all have @ ORGANIZATION1 to do it however they want @ MONTH1. People who do not wish to see the writer's message have the right not to do so. But when they fear the post and try to block someone else from seeing or hearing it, then they are violating the author's @ ORGANIZATION1 by telling them that they cannot include the offensive material. . Most writers include this material for a reason. For example, swear words, like those supported in @ PERSON2, often show character traits and also enhance the setting. Back then, people called @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 by meaningful names, even those who had no prejudices. It was their way of life and the author was just trying to show it to the reader. By censoring the word in the text, people were sort of covering the story of @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5. Anyone over the age of eighteen has the right to read whatever they want. They are no longer under the orders of their legal guardians and are in no case under the orders of the parents of other children. Parents who prefer that their own children not see or listen to certain content have the right to censor their children's content. On the other hand, they are not allowed to tell their neighbors what their children can and cannot see. Each parent has different rules and guidelines for their children, and that is their right. They @ MONTH1 believe it is important that their children are exposed to these certain materials early in life so that they can learn right from wrong early on. They may not even care. Whatever the @ MONTH1 cause, they have the right to expose their children to whatever they see fit. For example, @ PERSON3 is an author who has been challenged throughout her career. Many of her books deal with the subject of menstruation, which many parents have found inappropriate for their elementary school children to read. Therefore, these parents brought the books to the attention of the school board, which quickly removed the books from the shelves of their library. Many parents, librarians and teachers were upset by this and argued that the topic was not harmful at all. In the fourth grade girls have to watch a puberty-themed video, and in the fifth grade many girls themselves begin to experience these changes. So why is it inappropriate for them to read fiction books that include the subject ? Many parents believe this is not the case and even encouraged their children to read the books, but other parents who found it offensive restricted their children's right to read. Therefore, in the long run, the censorship is wrong. This restricts the @ ORGANIZATION1 of the audience and the writer, preventing growth experiences for both. If everyone banned a book they found offensive, the world would be bookless and would get pretty boring. No one would be able to read and no one would be able to express themselves freely.

The library is a very rich place, but there are just a few things that shouldn't be displayed or made visible to the public. Some subjects or other things found in the library are not suitable for everyone and should not be allowed in a public place. First, there should be a censorship of what you can and cannot get or view in a library. What if someone looks up or checks something that shouldn't be seen by others and ends up in someone's wrong hands. That person could then end up using the information for the worse. Not everything in the library is appropriate for all ages. Then there are a lot of offensive things that you can find in the library. So things should be censored so that we end up getting hurt. The librarian or anyone out there @ MONTH1 never knows what anyone has been looking for or planning until @ MONTH1 happens or a problem is triggered. Therefore, blocks should be put in place for things that can be harmful to others. Finally, although people @ MONTH1 think that no one is interested in what they are looking for or checking, they should think that it is open to the public and that anyone can easily see or return to what they were watching. It's not fair to be in a public place and be hurt by someone's offense. People must think that the library is open to children and the elderly. In conclusion, there should be censorship on what you can find in the library. There are hurtful and inappropriate things that absolutely should not be allowed. Most importantly, a library is a place where you shouldn't be offended by what someone searches, checks, or even says.

I say they shouldn't take off the books which are found to be shocking and I will say why I think so. I think they shouldn't take those books down because that's how it was written, and if the person who finds it offensive then don't read it. Another reason they shouldn't remove it is because an author wrote it down but I'm sure he didn't think anyone was going to find it offensive. My third reason they shouldn't 'don't take it off the shelf is because the book can be really good and interesting, except to someone who thinks it's offensive. I just told you why I think they shouldn't take the book off the shelf just because said so.

All materials in a library must be checked out from the library before anyone can take them out of the library. The librarian should ensure that everything that comes out of the library needs to be checked before a student can take materials out of the library. the topics that will be covered are: why documents should be removed from the library, what if you do not remove the documents and what if you lose the documents you remove from the library library. The materials that the library has available should be checked by everyone if they want to check out anything from the library. So the librarian can then tell a student if they want a book, music, movie, magazine, etc., the librarian can tell the student if the material is in or is being retrieved from the library. Then the student can check the material or can ask the librarian to keep the material when it comes back for the student. Then the whole school can function properly and the librarian can keep track of the documents that are in the library. If you don't see the documents in the library, no one will be able to see where the documents are. Which, if you have checked out documents from the library, the librarian can find them for you. So if you don't check it, the librarian won't be able to find the material that is in the library. So, the librarian cannot tell a student where the documents are, then the documents are taken out of the library and no one can look at them. Then the librarian has to wait for the person who took the material out of the library to bring the material back to the library so that it can be checked out by the person who wanted it when it came out of the library. If you remove something from the library and lose it, you will have to pay for it. When you lose something from the library, it means that no one will be able to verify it until it is returned or you have to pay the librarian money to buy a new one. Then the next person who wants to will have to wait even longer to get the materials because you have lost the copy of the material libraries you are checking out. Then the librarian should make sure that the next person who wants the material can get it each time they come back to the library. Then the person who lost the material should no longer be able to check out anything from the library. their courses. Also, if you don't remove the materials from the library and lose them, the librarian won't be able to find the materials for anyone who wants them, so check them out. These are just a few of the many reasons why you should view library materials. There are many more reasons why you should consult library materials. Thus, the librarian will be able to keep track of all the material that is in the library, and anyone can consult any material they want or need for a course and they don't have to stay in the library when you never want it

If there was a book on a shelf that I found offensive I would like it removed, but again, I wouldn't. Everyone has their own opinions and their own outlook. Mine are different from everyone else. I mean @ MONTH1 finds it offensive, but how is everyone going to see if it is or not, if you take it off the shelf ? Everyone is entitled to their opinion. What we do, believe or think is what makes us ourselves. Just because someone finds a book, music, or movie offensive doesn't mean everyone will. Others might like it even if you don't like it. Taking something away just because you think it's offensive is like taking away a small part of someone. It is as if the school obliges the children to wear uniforms, it takes away our individuality. We all need to have a way of expressing ourselves and maybe the thing that you find offensive is expressing someone else in some way. There will be a lot of things in life that people won't like, but can you really get rid of them ? It does not work like that. You won't always have your way in life, but it is life and there is nothing you can do about it. Just because you don't like something or find something offensive doesn't mean you can just delete or replace it. Life is going as planned and there will be things you don't like, but you can't change that. That's life and replacing or removing things won't make it any easier. So if I found something offensive I would just ignore it and leave it there because is taking it off the shelf really going to help ?

Yes, I think there are some materials that should be taken off the shelves of a library if they are offensive ! because people don't want or like to go to a public library that is open to everyone, let them in and @ CAPS1 a book or etc. offensive to that person. As if a child grabbed an inappropriate bad book and her mom found her reading it, then she wasn't too happy and left. t @ CAPS1 which might be offensive to someone in particular. There are certain books, magazines, etc. that don't need to be in the library. Because the public don't need @ CAPS1 stuff like that in a public library. By the way, someone who might think that a certain book is offensive might report that book or etc. if it is offensive to someone who is irregular in that certain public library. So look at what you bring or put in a public library, it should fit where all the audiences that come into a beautiful library. Being offensive is not a good thing because you want to be able to walk around a nice public library and be relaxed without being surprised by an unreasonable book or magazine that should be there. Music is a big deal with people offending about it because there is so much inappropriate and bad language music here that they have to watch what they put in the library especially for small children , the elderly too. Books are material that should be fun or interesting for people to read, not for people to look at or find on the shelves an offensive book or magazine because that's not what the library is for. is to relax and find a book or etc. have and be good with, or verified for use elsewhere

Books, music, movies and magazines have been taken off the shelves. We block or cease these items forever. The reasons why iot is a great idea is that it is parents of kids and religious people who are so against some of the things that are being broadcast if you want something uncensored you can buy or rent an unrated version. . children are our future, why would you want to destroy such a young and innocent spirit? If your child watches @ CAPS1 for one second and is as happy as he can get and the next one watches people killed and @ CAPS2 bombs dropped, that will stay on his mind forever. I don't think you would be too happy if your child learned the valgure language of @ CAPS3 or @ CAPS4. Imagine your @ NUM1 year talking to you, then saying an inappropriate word without knowing where it came from, just ignore it, then that vacabulary turns into much worse words and phrases, turning the kid into a potty of mouth maybe even violent. we don't want our future presidents and authorities to be so violent that they put work at risk just because they pulled out of @ CAPS3, do we ? Parents have the right to watch what they want, but also have the power to stop what they don't want them and their @ CAPS11 to see or even hear. Nowadays more and more families like to take car trips together and vacation watching @ CAPS3 and listening to tgo the @ CAPS4 while they spend a minute, they are all singing happy as can be up to that a song with a bunch of innocuous words is not only disrespectful but embarrassing to hear your kids sing over it. parents don't want to listen to that so they turn it off all is well until they hear them singing again on their music devices @ CAPS2, @ CAPS8, @ CAPS9, bombs all around the car it n There is no escaping this is when parents should have a say in what their children watch, but also listen and read. The books on @ CAPS14 @ CAPS13 and @ CAPS15 aren't something an @ NUM2 year old should read, nor do we need them to be a parent stoner group. One minute, you think you're reading a book about love and romance, and then you read that the character smokes a joint. People with strong religeouns don't want to watch @ CAPS3 late at night and then watch @ CAPS11 gut that @ CAPS12 does @ CAPS13 and sleep with all these girls yes it's @ MONTH1 be funny for those non believers but for those who have a religion it's just disrespectful. Then, listening to music, hearing about people with no religion, lighting fires at crosses, and using valgure language and the names of lords in the vein. It's not something they want to hear. When it comes to reading a book, religious people have a strong opinion on what to read so they usually stick to @ ORGANIZATION1 but what happens when their kids go to school for find a fake @ ORGANIZATION1 with nothing but lies and dirty pictures in it? @ CAPS3 shows, music, books and magazines should always be censored, it not only sets a good example for everyone, but it helps us as a community to stay strong. Not being violent or swearing at everything you say won't hurt anyone. Why would you want a future president to be a violent killing machine? the environment we grow up in is the way we get @ CAPS13, @ CAPS14 and @ CAPS15 to be read or heard is not the way to be

I think they should leave them on the shelves. I think people take things like that seriously, if they don't like them I think they should just leave them out. What some people might find offensive, others will find interesting. There are a lot of things out there that can be a little offensive to some people, but if they don't like it all they have to do is put them in place and move on with their lives as if it was not a big deal. In the past there have been movies that poke fun at people for the way they act or just for something they did in the past. Stuff like that, I can understand because it can be personal reasons. There were also times when I saw people getting a big deal for nothing. Sometimes people say things and the person reading them can take them in a whole different way. the language it contains or maybe make fun of another race. I think the worst thing today is magazines because they always judge people by who they are, what they did at TIME1, or even who has the best body and who has the worst body. I think people should stop worrying about everyone else. so much and just worrying about themselves and we wouldn't have so many problems.

Different books are not meant for different people. Yes, sometimes it is important that certain documents are not meant to be released in public. But, we need to know what is going on all over the world. Even as we speak, there may be a battle going on somewhere or something very important is about to happen in another country. We will need this information all the time. There's this old adage that I once read in a book: "You can't judge a man until you claim under his skin and walk around in it." It took me a while to figure out what they didn't mean by that. Then I fully understood what they didn't really mean. You cannot judge someone by their outward appearance, you have to judge their inner personality. When you watch a book, movie, magazines, etc., you can't judge it until you see it for yourself. Companionship people create these things for certain people who appreciate the things they like. TV shows, newspapers, books, etc. All the things to make them happy. We must take advantage of what we have in this life. People always say the world is going to end. But this will not be the case, for that we will live in the hereafter.

BAD @ CAPS1 Do you really want your kids to see bad pictures or read bad prompts ? I do not think so ! you can help them by teaching them what is right or wrong, right or wrong. You have to help them to have a clear knowledge so that they know what to do when they meet these obsessives in life. You could do what my aunt @ PERSON1 is doing. Whenever she goes through the checkout of a local store @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 or other stores, she turns over magazines that she thinks are inappropriate. My mom and dad say this is a silent protest because she doesn't hurt anyone else, she just doesn't like it. It makes my dad upset every time he watches Tella Vision with us and it's something they've never seen on @ CAPS4 like half-naked girls on comershals so he's going to turn off the channel or the close. because he doesn't want us to expose the bad things in the world. My mom is the same way, but she won't let us watch @ NUM1 movies if I wanted to watch these, I was usually at my friends house. My mom would probably be a little upset. I think books are ok because you don't see a lot of picture books you have to read them and imagine the picture in their head. In conclusion, I hope you will feel the same as me the next time you go through that start stop and think to yourself if I want little eyes to see this. Then you have to turn this maggizne U- turn past the @ CAPS4 and the music, you should also DEE the book so you know what it is about

To whom it concerns @ MONTH1 : As time goes by in our ever expanding world, it seems that one thing that is constantly fought and argued is censorship. Censorship allows things in our world that are considered “ offensive ” to be compromised. People these days though. must be offended much more easily these days, because it seems the media is more censored than it ever has been. For my part, I'm sick of having the "veil over my eyes" so to speak. Most of the censorship in this country is handled by programs that our government has put in place, the censorship should not be the responsibility of an organization, but rather the person watching it. In other words, why should other people decide what is best for us to watch ? No one knows you better than yourself, so why shouldn't you decide ? Why should censorship exist in our media if it does not exist in our everyday life? There is a lot that people see that they wish they had seen, it all depends on how you take it. No matter who it is, people are going to see things they don't want to see, that's just life. Censorship denies our rights as citizens @ CAPS1 to have the right to free speech. If you don't like something you see then look away

Should documents, such as books, music, movies, or magazines be removed from shelves if they are offensive ? I don't think so, because that might not be offensive to everyone, it would be breaking the law, and it's not fair to the artist who created them. Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't mean it's offensive to everyone. For example, some people might think that @ CAPS1 is offensive, while others think it is religion. It would just show that one man's garbage is another man in the trash. It would also be breaking the law, because that would not give the artist his freedom of expression. That would shut up all the great artists out there, trying to be a herd. They should be able to write, sing or film whatever they want. It is their right to do so. This is the reason why they should not be taken off the shelves. It wouldn't be fair to the artist who created them, it would be breaking the law, and what one person thinks is not what everyone thinks.

Censorship is a method of limiting certain content that has been deemed inappropriate. This method is widely used today in the modern world. Censorship is used most often with our films, video games, and television. If other forms of entertainment like television and the Internet use such methods, our libraries should not. Likewise, if these methods are not made mandatory, should some titles be blocked by our children. This limiting agent called censorship can be very useful in our everyday life. Censorship could allow us to keep track of what our children and adolescents see. This agent can currently be installed on products such as our televisions, computers and telephones. So if the precautionary measures are taken on the following products, would it not be appropriate if the actions were also in our libraries. Shouldn't our libraries be a place for kids to wander the shelves picking up and reading random books without thinking about picking up a book that is inappropriate for their age group. Personally, that's what a library should be for me. Discuss the topic that was discussed previously. A block should be mandatory for libraries. This blocking would not completely abolish the books but rather limit their audience. Books should be classified by age group. And with the blockage some children, depending on the age, would not be able to fit into the section and would prevent certain subjects from reaching children who are not mature enough. Some materials should not be seen by young children. It is not only a statement based on opinion, but also on facts. Evidence-based experience comes into play when young children read and watch pictures intended for a more mature audience. These titles strongly influence a child's thoughts and actions. The other day one of my cousins who have not more @ NUM1 years watching two people of the opposite sex and began to ask questions such as : When are they going to kiss ? or why doesn't he touch her? These questions do not come naturally but only through her viewing material that she was not ready to view. The origin of these questions will probably never be known but there are ways to prevent such topics from being discussed and that is to censor what children read, see or listen to in our libraries.

Your @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 are a lot of things done and say in this world today people take offense. It could be something someone said about their religion or kidnapping @ CAPS1 from others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and merchandise should be taken off store shelves just because people find it offensive ? I don't think @ CAPS3 it should work that way. @ CAPS2 is a variety of different religions, races and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf every time we found it offensive we wouldn't have anything to sell. When it comes to young children, they won't know what to think and believe. As they see and hear things, children begin to believe them. Media that adults find offensive should not be published and exposed for children to see and listen to. Even if the kids @ MONTH1 don't take offense at any of the media, you still need to think about parents and what they think is right for their children. There are many Life Effects published in the media every day for everyone to see, and some parents @ MONTH1 don't find it appropriate for their children to hear about them. Drugs, alcohol and swearing have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibility to protect themselves from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves and make their own judgments. Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in and what we think is right or wrong. Your parents are teaching you the way they want you to act and teaching you the difference between what they think is right and wrong. I have been taught to always be respectful to others and to do my best in everything I do @ MONTH1. Some people @ MONTH1 have an actor or actress as a model, so whenever they see that person on @ CAPS3.V. You tend to think that whatever they do, you can do it. Some parents @ MONTH1 take offense to a TV show because they don't think @ CAPS3 that their child is just watching it. While others don't see @ CAPS3 a problem with this. So if we cancel this show on @ CAPS3.V. You are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to movies, people have their own ratings for movies, but the state rates them every time they come out. Now in theaters you have to be eighteen to see a movie rated @ CAPS5, or you have to have a parent with you because you are going alone and your parents don't know you are bothering those of a lot. . Along with libraries and cinemas, they have what the state thinks is adults only in their own little section. My parents think that if @ CAPS2 is a law for something, it's @ CAPS2 for a reason and we will respect them. Like some parents, they have their own rules. As some parents think it is okay for their children to drink before age as long as they stay home with them and know what is going on. A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @ CAPS6. I didn't think about it @ CAPS3 and just turned on their movie and we watched it. There were a few words in it that his parents @ CAPS3 didn't agree to watch, and he really liked the movie. His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents didn't want him to hear at his age. He didn't know @ CAPS3 any better and since he thought it was awesome he approached people saying this quote. His mom wasn't happy and asked him where he heard it from and he told her about the movie, and she didn't think @ CAPS3 that he needed to say that and he had trouble. Told him it was my fault I let him watch the movie and @ CAPS3 didn't think about it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age. This is just to show that @ CAPS2 contains a lot of different things in this world today that not everyone will agree on. So if we took something off the shelf because somebody took offense, we wouldn't have anything in this world today. We learn the things we do for a living because the state has requirements that must be met. What we learn outside of school depends on what your parents believe. So if @ CAPS2 is something outside of @ CAPS2 you don't believe @ CAPS3 stays away, and let those who believe in it enjoy learning it.

How many of you absolutely love to read? Well, I'll be the first to admit that I don't prefer to read. Meanwhile, whether or not I prefer reading of all types, I despise all negative books. Censorship of books is very important in today's way of life. You can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book. The cover often creates a vivid image and will generally promote a general idea. Let's take a look at a few reasons why I think graphic or offensive books should be taken off the shelves. What about the youngest people who like to read? While kids have vivid imaginations, writers shouldn't fill their heads with crazy ideas. First of all, kids these days grab a book from a shelf and get interested in it very quickly, or automatically assume it's not for them. Also, when a child comes across a very offensive book, it can hurt him. Books are meant to provide educational information or be entertaining. They should not be dirty or discouraging to certain people. More importantly, how many different races are there here at @ LOCATION1, or even all over the world ? Many different breeds are interested in new books to learn new ways. When they come across books that do not teach for all races or that act upon knowing bad examples about their gender, they feel disheartened. Whether it's a movie, magazine, books, or even a song, it should never be offensive to anyone. When writers, publishers, songwriters or film producers publish these articles, they don't think about the environment. Their main concept is to entertain, but sometimes the entertainment can be quite shy. More importantly, if it contains sexual gestures, it should be removed without debate. It is offensive to parents of young children who visit libraries. A public library open to everyone should have sections for books, movies, CDs or magazines that are too lively. There is a wide range of books lying around and one @ MONTH1 meets one that is highly offensive. I think they should have a note on whether or not the book belongs on the shelf. I haven't experienced it yet, but trust me, it could happen anytime in our world today. If I were a parent, I would not encourage the distribution of magazines or books of a sexual nature in a public library. Finally, during this debate, some older people or those with a dirtier mind will oppose this issue. Who says kids should be allowed in adult sections? Why do discouraged people read books that set a bad example? These are some of the questions you will ask here of those who oppose what I have written today. Adults should have their own personal section for adult books, movies, or magazines. Minor children should stick to finding books in areas or areas that will interest them. In conclusion, those who counter-argue might be on the winning side, but I still think offensive books should be taken off the shelves. Book lovers around the world want entertainment, but in a good way. The youngest children of our time must now be influenced in the right way. Additionally, there is no better way to help improve society than by removing offensive and non-influential books from libraries. Let's make an inference and say, if we work to remove these offensive books, young children will become more educated.

READ OUR BOOKS Our book and movies can be very scary and uninteresting, to a lot of violence and mess, for young children scary books and movies will make them @ ORGANIZATION1 mares. Books like @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ CAPS1 are great books for teens, @ ORGANIZATION1 teaches them about the past and what it was like to be a parent you need your kids to watch the right shows and movies and they need to watch the important movies too. Hitler treated people so badly that he killed so many people that I think it's a good lesson for children to watch movies about him and read books. I also think @ CAPS1 is a good book because girls and guys shouldn't be forcing someone's wrong, it's so unfair. Young children should never have to go through what she called for help, but no one could accommodate her. she was physically and mentally abused, no one wanted to hear it, it was wrong. She never spoke, but you could see she was in pain just because of how she looked and how calm she was. Movies like these should teach children never to abuse another person. Parents stay on top of your kids, watch what they read and you should always be careful what your kids are doing, give them a book that will teach them something.

What happened to everyone with the right to have the freedom to knoledge? I don't believe that some material should be removed only for the reason that someone finds it "offensive" or "inappropriate". Our young people have the right to access these materials. Children should have this right because it allows better access to knoledge, it provides more realistic details about life, and prevents them from being excluded from the world around them. We cannot deprive children of this. First , all children and school students everywhere should have access to more knoledge. If certain materials are censored and removed, they cannot access this kind of learning. What if a student wants to learn more about the work of Goverment and Politics by reading an article. But then the article is removed because of a little comment in it. We cannot take away our longing to learn more about the world. Second , it can give a more realistic picture of a person, place, thing, or event. Explicit content can give kids more detail about how things really are in life. If that is removed, they might have a different understanding of how things really are and have different expectations of things. It could have an emotional or psychalogical impact on them once they see the real world. They need to be knowledgeable about what life is like in more detail to avoid confusion once they get to that point . Finally, they could be excluded from the world if everything is kept from them due to censorship. Being kept from this kind of knoledge can be an emotional strain. A friend of mine had parents who blocked her from a lot of things in the world around her, blinding her of what she should have known. As she got older, things got harder and harder for her. And now she's Affraid of a lot of things in the real world. All because her parents had used to keep her censorship of what was important. Our students should always have access to knoledge, details about life, and not required to know enough to have an undertanding of things in our modern world. We cannot allow censorship to make such irrational descisions about what we do and do not have access to. And if it has a negative impact on society and youth, why not censor

Hi I'm kristin, I'm here to tell you why we should be removing certain magazines from our public libraries. Now I don't know if you've heard of @ CAPS1 magazine or @ CAPS2 magazine. But I have them and I also used to read them. In some of these problems there is sexual counseling. Now, if I was a mother and my child ran to me begging me to let them criticize, I would look at them and say no. They don't need to understand sex until they're teenagers or at least thirteen or fourteen. A child should not even be able to approach this area, they should only be able to approach the children's section. Some parents think like me and agree that a child shouldn't learn sex. But others are like why not they'll find out in @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 and when they get married too. There are also other things that need a library. Some music may not be the best choice for a young child. Like rap music, for example. There's a lot of swearing in it and talking about sex. Some of the things said in a rap song are short, let me take you like a hurricane. It's just like saying hey chick, let's do it for fun. This is not what I want my child to listen to. I want my kid to listen to stuff that says okay let's go outside and camp or duck duck gusse. Some movies can be watched with your kids as long as they don't go past @ NUM1. But if it does, they can't watch it. I'll give you another example, my little niece is probably about ten years old. She watches @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 but only with her parents in the same room as her. She can't watch it on her own or she will be punished. This is why some things should be removed from our public libraries

I believe that some of the materials that we have on our shelf belong to virtually anyone in the world. I also think the materials on this shelf can be taken out as long as those materials are put back in that location, no matter what. My experience with books is not really great, but I like to read when I have free time to read. When I get a book I look at the book and observe it that way, when I take it out of the library I know I wanted to read that book and observe the great thing about the book. when i read the book i'm not a very fast reader, but when i read i like to know how this book ends and how it started. If I had to pick a magazine from the library, I wouldn't remove it from the library, as magazines are sometimes expensive to obtain and difficult to replace if there was a need to replace them. But if I had to get one, I'd be looking at the important stuff about what it is and how to get it and all that stuff. there are times when i think movies shouldn't be able to access the library because people could pull out movie ideas and / or steal them. films in libraries would be expensive to pay if they were taken from the library. if i had to watch a movie i would enjoy it as much as i can because once that day to shoot it there is no chance to watch it after i render it. Music is a passion for most people. most people would go out and buy CDs or something to listen to and that was the music that I would listen to so I would have an idea what to play on if I ever wanted to be a musician or something like that. these are times when I was writing the lyrics to a song so that I could understand what the singer is singing, either that or listening to the song over and over again. What I mean is if something comes off the shelf it has to go back to its place or else there will be consequences and people will not be trusted any longer.

Do you think censorship is a good thing? Do you think libraries should take more responsibility for what they offer people? A lot of people think they should. But I don't agree, if they don't want to know more about this topic then don't read the book. Public libraries are a great help to the community. They are really useful for children who do not have certain materials at home. Libraries think about the information children see. That is why there are restricted areas for children of a certain age. Also, it's not always about what the library displays, but also about parents letting their kids read things they aren't supposed to read. While for some people certain information is offensive, to others it may not be. People will always have different points of view. These materials cannot be removed, they can be important at certain times in our lives. All the information is useful in one way or another. The immense amount of knowledge our libraries hold shouldn't be taken away just because someone wants

Libraries are filled with hundreds of documents that many @ CAPS4 like and dislike. Books on @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2. These books are @ CAPS3 here to offend you, they are here to educate you on the subject. Censorship should only be for young people as an adult, you are open to anything. You make your own desicons and live by them. If you feel that a book, song, or movie is offensive, then stop reading, listening, or watching. @ CAPS3 everyone is offended. I believe no citizen has the right to remove anything from a library because of @ NUM1- @ CAPS3 everyone is @ NUM2- @ CAPS4 have different @ CAPS2 and outlook on @ NUM3- @ CAPS5 the @ CAPS6. I conclude by saying that censorship is enforced, but should not be enforced to a large extent, @ CAPS7 does to us what we do and learn what we learn. In school we were forced to learn what we are learning, I think @ CAPS5 has the right to have outside knowledge, but the only way to get it is we get it from the basics data such as computers, books, music, art, etc.

Libraries are places of learning. Books, magazines, films and all types of media are placed there for the same specific purpose: to learn and to explore. When we visit libraries, we expect to find the information we have come for. Whether the topic is something as simple as wanting to learn more about one type of flower or researching the infamous " In @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 ", we want the truth and information in its rawest form. Documents should never be refused at the library. He still has some value. Whether for cultural, spiritual, entertainment, or whatever purpose, books can serve as the purpose of information and exploration in a new world. Books that are considered " censored " are only censored from one point of view. Another person might find this book exactly what they are looking for. If someone considers a book to be “offensive,” they have to put themselves in someone else's shoes and see where it came from; where this type of information @ MONTH1 may be of use to someone else. Sensitive topics such as @ CAPS3 or @ MONTH1 religion books should be considered censored, but this only affects one group of people. What about the other percentage? Now don't get me wrong. I don't think racy or graphic films or magazines should be allowed in the library, but any kind of material containing legitimate cultural, educational, entertaining and other purposes should never be refused at the library. Working at a local library, I know that when people sign up to become a library member, they sign an agreement that says they know what kind of material they can view. So on to agree with what they allow to let their children verify. If parents and guardians think libraries are forcing censored content on their children, they should read the fine print! They allow their children to be exposed to it. And all “ that ” is is information and entertainment in the raw. Libraries are created to allow open access to information for anyone. These documents should include information on any subject that the library may have in its possession. None should be refused. People rely on libraries as a source of knowledge, and we must work to ensure that this source continues to grow.

The problem with this situation is that some people think that certain things shouldn't be in the library. I don't believe there are some things that are on the library shelves that should be removed. I think because everyone has a different kind of "offense" for their family. A family can accept that their child watches certain movies, listens to different types of music, and reads different kinds of books. If you took them out, people wouldn't be able to express it the way they wanted. Also, the library would lose service because people would find that some particular libraries have restrictions on what they have on their shelves, so they won't want to go if they are going to be dropped on something. they are looking for

What if one day you go to the library and come across an offensive book? Would you like it taken off the shelf or just ignore it ? Every year, tons of @ CAPS1 visit libraries looking for a good book, giving feedback and personal appeal. Everyone has a different choice in what types of books they would like to read, with which offensive and non-offensive material comes. As a teenager, I had the opportunity to visit the library where things strike me as more offensive than others, but like many, I chose to ignore it. The reasons for ignoring it are quite simple, everyone has different views on the things they have come together in from birth, as we will as personal life experiences. Because everyone has different life experiences and different views on what offends them and what doesn't. The personal experiences I have had in the library come from the race seeing books that relate to the days of slavery @ MOIS1 to be offensive to me. But, a book on organizing the Black Panther might be offensive to someone else. So, does that mean it should be taken off the trade because it is offensive to both people ? Books have different tones depending on whether it is about life, politics, or worldly issues that make different people feel different. I have observed many times when someone feels energized by reading a book. Where someone else is reading the same thing and feeling bad. Take a magazine for example, a reader might look like this beautiful woman in that magazine and feel good about themselves. While an overweight reader could maybe read the same magazine and feel like he is not as good looking or dignified as the women in the magazine. That overweight women can feel offended, while other women feel amazing, for this simple reason, it shouldn't be taken off the shelves due to different views on what offends them and what doesn't. is not. Everyone reads books out of taste and in relation to them. If a book, magazine, or movie sounds offensive, that reader probably won't take it for more. When I come across material in a library that is offensive to me, I don't read it. Although I picked up some books that did not seem offensive, but after reading the material I found it to be offensive. In response, I simply returned the book and chose a different one. If I walked into a library and saw a book that offended me, I wouldn't ask for it to be taken off the shelf, I just ignored it. Everyone has different views on what offends them, so there isn't much you can do but ignore it. If it did, if a book offended someone and it was taken out of a library just because there was no real need for a library

In the book '@ CAPS1 @ NUM1', books are prohibited. In such a society, owning a book would entail punishment. Without books, the folks at @ CAPS2 turned to electronics for entertainment. Society as a whole had lost @ CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government. @ CAPS4 led to injustices the government inflicted on its people because they had no opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if the books start to be thrown away, there will be "no more books on the shelves for any of us." The folks at @ CAPS2 argue that some media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be deleted was removed, the important jobs of @ CAPS2 would be discarded. A recent debate arose about “ The @ CAPS3 of @ ORGANIZATION1 ” of @ PERSON1. The @ CAPS4 book is placed in @ LOCATION3 during the time of slavery. @ ORGANIZATION1 @ PERSON4 befriends a black man, @ PERSON6, and shares his @ CAPS2 experiences with him along @ LOCATION1. @ PERSON1 decided to write their book using the real diction of the people who lived in @ LOCATION3 during the @ CAPS4 period. He was the first author to do @ CAPS4. Because he wrote it @ CAPS4, the book contains the n-word multiple times. The word @ CAPS4 is not acceptable today, and therefore the folks at @ CAPS2 take offense at its work. However, the @ CAPS4 book plays a major role in the @ CAPS5 canon. The work of @ PERSON1 was written in a new and revolutionary way. If someone deleted the @ CAPS4 job from the library shelves, they would delete one of the most important pieces of @ CAPS5 literature. '@ ORGANIZATION2' by @ PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his stay at @ LOCATION2, he discovers that he is homosexual. He falls in love with a man named @ PERSON5 and starts having sex with @ CAPS2 men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If anyone read the surface of the book, they would find a crude description of the experience of a convict in prison. However, @ CAPS4 is not. @ PERSON3 has struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout her life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In '@ PERSON2' he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. @ CAPS4's story is not about sex, but about feelings of trapping and relationships with other people. If the @ CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries, @ CAPS2 people would be missing a story they could connect with. Katherine Paterson raises an interesting question. What if everyone could remove the books they don't like? The answer would be a society unable to share ideas, concerns and experiences. The media help to enlighten, persuade and educate people on important issues. While some @ MONTH1 works have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning.

In newspaper editions, should books, music, films, magazines and other reading material be removed if the material is considered offensive ? I don't think this is a good idea. The reasons why it's exactly like what @ PERSON1 an author (in the last sentence) said if we take books off the shelves there will be "no more books for any of us to read." This is true because I'm sure there are a lot of books that @ MONTH1 are offensive to people, but maybe readers who get offensive don't understand the material they are reading. For example, same sex liking has become a problem, maybe the reader who takes offense at these types of topics just doesn't get it, or @ MONTH1 doesn't. Another reason could be because we are in America, and the last time I checked we have free will to write and talk about what we want to talk or write about. It's fair to say that because well, it's true that the folks at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 just have the “right” to say whatever they want to say or what they think. And just because the subject of the reading material offends them doesn't mean you can remove the writer's material. Doing this is like putting duct tape over the writer's mouth. If the reader has the right to say what you think, then what is the point of being free to write what you want to write. If you can see where I'm from, it takes a lot not to tell a teacher or someone in a higher position of the reader, something that you don't understand and they tell you "you can't. don't ask me that "or" do tell me nothing 'it's the same if you take the writer's book away. Other reasons for saying no to removing reading material might be because humans are always ready to learn something new, by @ CAPS3. When a person reads, they always learn something new. It could be a new event, an unfamiliar place, grammar, different styles writing, or learn more about the subject. @ CAPS3 in books, music, movies and magazines is a good way to learn new things, it's fun and what better than @ CAPS3 something fun ? can not think of anything? well, it's because @ CAPS3 has a great role in our lives. a Another reason not to remove reading material is that @ MONTH1 makes other readers feel like they are not alone. Like a true story about a breakup, a family or a relationship. Or it could be a story based on something happening to the writer like the death of a loved one @ CAPS5 and how to deal with it. Just imagine two girls CAPS4 @, @ CAPS5 is angry against it - even and against the world and hate a tape on the corners. As the other girl @ CAPS4 just lost her grandmother and listening to the tape on the angles makes her feel whole or whole, knowing that her beloved @ CAPS5 is in the right place. Now think about it, the second girl would start to be like the first sad girl, alone or left behind. When you remove material like a small strip from the library shelf, you take away a feeling not only for the writer but also for the reader. Finally, the last reason not to remove the material from the shelves is if you remove the material from the shelf, the subject is likely still there. It can be on the radio, on the internet, on @ ORGANIZATION1 and what can you do to remove it? this is not the reality. And if that could happen, which is unlikely, people could still talk. And nothing can stop people from speaking. " You can put a bird in a cage but it still wants to fly " or " you can tell a cat or a dog not to run away but when you turn away it is gone " these are examples of what I'm trying to say, you can try removing books, music, magazines but the topic you don't like is still there. I understand that you are offended by reading some @ MOIS1 documents, but you better just turn your head and move on. Reader @ MOIS1 doesn't like the topic but others would and it's always good to think about it. And maybe the problem is the reader doesn't understand the topic, so maybe you should read it to learn from it, and to give it a chance @ MONTH1 end up liking it or understanding it better. Books, music, movies, magazines, there's a reason they're out there and it might teach you something new, so why not learn it.

Offensive articles and / or films and magazines, etc. should not be removed from the shelves. If individuals choose to read and / or view material that is their personal choice @ CAPS1, I think there should be an age limit for the material. If people find the material offensive, they should turn their backs and not read or watch the programs. If the articles are in a public library, they should be kept in a separate area for those who wish to consult them. They should not be left in the open for young children or for people who do not wish to see them. Historical documents such as newspapers and event reports should be kept in federal libraries. Having these materials in a public library might interest young children in reading things that are not suitable for them. Some articles such as magazines, newspapers and books, some of these articles are held at a public level. Documents affiliated with the government should be kept in a federal library, such as extracts from history and important documents. High level documents such as the constitution should be kept in high security areas. In conclusion, people who want to see certain documents should be able to do so, as I mentioned earlier. They should not be in the open for small children. It should be kept in a separate area. If people don't want to see this material, they just don't go to that area. It is essential to have an age limit for this material so that small children do not see it and get the wrong message. Having certain acts in public and certain documents in federal libraries is a factor. Certain historical documents and other objects affiliated with the government should be kept at the federal level as well as important documents related to the country. These documents must be high level secure areas

Communities have many types of people living in them. Some groups of people find certain things offensive while others find them totally trivial. Some of these things cause conflict. A library, for example, is a place where @ MONTH1 finds some of these conflicts. Most libraries are open to the public. Therefore, many different groups of people will share library material, such as books, movies, magazines, and music. Having many types of people sharing this material, libraries should try to have material to appeal to everyone. This is where the conflict begins. While trying to please everyone, some people @ MONTH1 find some of the material offensive. Now the big question: Should material that some find offensive be taken off the shelves all together? The answer to this big question is no. Libraries must contain many different types of material to appeal to all members of the community. People are different and believe in different things. Just because a person finds one type of material offensive does not mean that it is offensive to everyone. For example, things like religion. Someone @ MONTH1 finds a book about a type of religion and finds it very offensive, but others @ MONTH1 strongly believe in that religion. Just because someone takes it in an offensive way doesn't mean those who don't should take it away from them. Libraries cater to all kinds of people. Just because a person finds the material offensive does not mean that it should be taken away from everyone. If libraries removed material that someone would find offensive in any way, there would be no material left. People believe in different things. This is how it always has been and more than likely, how it always will be

I think the censorship in @ CAPS1 libraries is pretty abominable. I think there shouldn't be any censorship, it's @ CAPS1 that parents decide what kids can and can't watch. I think if anything from @ CAPS1 is offensive don't look at it, it's that simple. If you don't want your kids to watch something offensive or rude, don't let them. What I think is offensive, @ CAPS1 when something @ CAPS1 was taken off the shelves. I think kids, but not the youngest, maybe @ NUM1 and up, should be able to watch and listen whatever they want. I think some things that people find offensive are only offensive to these kinds of people. It @ MONTH1 is not offensive to anyone else, so do not remove that particular movie or song from the libraries. A good example of this would be the book, TO @ CAPS2 A @ CAPS4. He was banned and then banned from many school libraries, because of his vulgar words and his references to rape. I think @ CAPS1 is unfair because whether we like it or not kids @ NUM1 and up will hear rude and offensive things anyway. I think books, or movies, or music, that contain profanity, @ CAPS1 is a part of life, because most adults swear. And remove those things from a library @ CAPS1 remove them from adults as well as children. It is @ CAPS1 that parents decide when their children hear these things, if any. I also think that by using "offensive" remarks @ CAPS1 is just another part of our story. Take To @ CAPS2 A @ CAPS4 for example, at that time it was common for black people to talk slang and men to swear when angry. This @ CAPS1 how great people are and were. Taking these things off the shelves won't prevent teens from hearing them. I think they have the right to hear it if they want to, and the parents have enough rights to let them. I think songs that have words sounded on the radio @ CAPS1 are useless because your teenager will know what they are saying anyway. I think banned books @ CAPS1 is not a wise thing to do, as it just makes kids want to hear the word more than usual. Basically we have the right to hear and read these things. Taking away the things to which we have rights, @ CAPS1 taking away our freedom and our free will. If parents don't want their children to read or hear these things, then they need to watch what they read or listen to. It doesn't make sense to single out a particular book or song that @ CAPS1 just likes to distinguish all songs and all books

Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life. However, many people find different things offensive than others. People are offended by many subjects, be it race, religion, gender, etc. If there's a book you find offensive in a public library, I don't think it should be deleted. It's like taking something away just because a person doesn't like it. It wouldn't be fair to everyone who uses this library. He @ MONTH1 is offensive to you but to another person he @ MONTH1 is not. There are several reasons why a book might be in the library. It might help someone write an article, learn about a topic, or research a topic. If all books, music, magazines, movies, or anything else in a library were to be removed if someone found it offensive, there would be hardly any books left in the library. I think all books should be kept in the library even if someone finds it offensive. It might be offensive to them, but not to someone else. If one person finds an offensive book and another person does not find it, it is not fair for the unoffended person not to be able to consult it. If the problem is that children are checking what they could learn from it, it would be the parents' fault for not supervising what their children are checking. Child @ MONTH1 is learning something new from the book. Even if it is offensive, you can still learn something from the book, movie, magazine, music, etc. If you are still reading the book, it might help change your mind on the subject. It @ MONTH1 helps other people change their minds by bringing them new opinions on the topic that they never thought of. A condition why a book, movie, magazine, music, etc. would be removed if all the world to agree on that - on. If everyone who came to this library was offended by it then it @ MONTH1 would be in the best interest of the library to get rid of this book. The main idea is that all the books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it. If a person doesn't like this then they just shouldn't check out the item. If this was what happened every time someone found something offensive in a library there would be next to nothing to check. Even if it is offensive to you, it might be useful to another person

At @ CAPS1 @ ORGANIZATION1 my name is @ CAPS2 I'm from @ ORGANIZATION2. I agree that books, music, movies and magazines are taken off the shelves. If that's not something kids should learn, then why put them on the shelves. Lots of books that children, teens, and adults read cause a lot of violence and threats. It is a major cause nowadays and we want a peaceful world. Often times we see teens and children arguing or having a bad mouth with other people. It's not a good thing to watch and it's mainly because they watch an @ CAPS3 show about negative stuff or read a book or just try to be cool. If we could put bigger learning books, movies, etc., there would be less aggression in the world. To have a more positive day and come out and say I read the wonderful book by @ ORGANIZATION1 which taught me something new in life would be the best thing to hear. Teaching something that a child can remember or that is useful in the long run is the best thing. Knowing that they are doing something educational is just a great feeling. Now when do you see kids doing what they're supposed to be doing? You really aren't because they are too busy wanting to find trouble to get in. It's really not good for them, they should always learn the right things to help them in life. It's a tough world for these kids and they should learn the best they can.

Materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive ! It is a public library. Not many people would like to find something that seems to hurt or hurt them in any way. Libraries are made so that people come in and should appreciate something, whether it is a book, a movie, or a magazine. When people come looking for good information on something, they are eager to find great advice and not be left behind. Example, with something about someone who may be racist. It is a disappointment for some. No one should have to go in and find something that offends them. It is not fair. Now to parents with children. Would you like your kid to go to a library that is allowed to look wherever their little heart desires, and they stumble upon porn or anything that could have a bad influence on them ? I highly doubt it. Unless you don't care what your kid reads these days, but those who want their kid to have a good education, well you get my statement. This is just not fair to those who go to a library expect to be satisfied, but rather are disappointed. It doesn't do them any good and it might make your community look bad. Libraries need to help people with information, fun facts, and great resources. So please put away the wrong books, music, magazines, etc.

I believe censorship is a good thing; to an extent. I think the censorship relates to an age group and the permission of parents or guardians. If a consumer is twelve years of age and under ; then the consumer should buy the censored books, etc., but, if you are thirteen and over, you should be able to buy uncensored products. Some people don't like censored products because they feel it takes away that particular thing. Music, for example, many people get angry when the lyrics of songs on a @ CAPS1 are censored. It does not allow people to get the full effect of the music and the “ message ” that the artist or group is sending. With books ; people get angry because they can't understand the whole aspect of the book. Censoring a book is like removing part of a masterpiece. Some books should be censored like many romance novels; these get pretty graphic and go into great detail with sexual themes and content. I don't think these books should be on the shelves. In magazines ; it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading. If a person reads a political magazine ; these magazines don't include all the real facts and details for some reason. If a person reads a hunting or fishing magazine ; then they can put all the gun facts, calls, lures and stories they want and don't have to censor them. Movies, on the other hand, are censored on some channels. If you are watching a movie on a @ CAPS2 network like @ ORGANIZATION2 or @ CAPS3 ; these channels censor movies. If you watch movies on @ ORGANIZATION1 or @ CAPS4, they don't censor the movies because they are only movie channels. This is also why movies have ratings. R is reserved for people under seventeen (without the presence of an adult), @ NUM1 is intended for people under sixteen without an adult. and @ CAPS5 and @ CAPS6 are suitable for all age groups. In all; censorship depends on the age group in which the consumer actually finds himself. If you're still in elementary school, you probably shouldn't be able to buy uncensored products; if you are between thirteen and fifteen you should be able to buy the product with an adult's permission, and if you are sixteen and over you should be able to buy the uncensored products without an adult present because you know you can handle ' offensive ' material

Books, music, and movies are all important, especially for children. If we decide to take a book off the shelf, then everyone else will and the shelf will be almost empty. The same idea for movies, magazines, music, ect. Even though some parents do not allow their young children to read or view uncensored materials in the library, it is the role of parents to supervise their children and to choose for them and to teach them what is good and what is. is bad to read or look. Libraries generally require @ CAPS1 cards. These @ CAPS1 cards allow the person to have access to adult material depending on the type of card they have. Since it's up to parents to decide what material their kids have access to, they shouldn't blame anyone if their kids have taken something off the shelf that they don't like. Libraries have done everything necessary to ensure the total safety of society. If we try to remove every book, movie, song, or magazine that has an offensive material, we'll have to remove almost everything. People have different cultures and beliefs. They might think that some things are offensive while others see them as normal. In today's society, many people are more drawn to movies or music that contain inappropriate material because these materials have recently taken over in the media. We can't stop publishing them, but we can censor them. There are different types of channels that view these documents. The Internet, @ ORGANIZATION1, and libraries can all be watched by parents. Thus, parents cannot blame anyone other than themselves if their children have read or seen unacceptable material. Libraries should stay as they are now and keep their censorship style unchanged. Parents should have full supervision of their children. Libraries have enough restrictions and rules on their books and movies based on the age of the people

I think there should be censorship in libraries for those who don't like or aren't comfortable with what's on the shelves. Someone should have no problem going or taking their children to the library. A public library is visited by children of all ages, sizes and races. If I take my kid (s) to a public library, I don't want to worry if my kid is reading or seeing something that they shouldn't or like

During my life, I have visited many libraries. I have also seen many categories of null books like comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama etc. As we all know, there are many topics that are not suitable for minors or many other ages. The films of this time and this era reveal a lot to you. For example, in cartoons there is sexual content like kissing. Some parents do not yet want their child to be exposed to this type of activity. Movies sometimes put false beliefs in people's minds about how things are, are going to be, or why you should see them. insists on how things used to be and hoe things are now. Another subject is that of magazines. There are some weird things going on in the world that @ CAPS1 should know why we put them in magazines, but kids can easily find them in libraries. Images in magazines are images that should appear in certain magazines. As there are bad things, there are also good things that come from magazines. Magazines are in some ways as useful as books. They contain very useful information. Music is also an important subject which is placed in libraries. Some of the laugues that are put on the cd tracks are good BUT there is a lot of bad material on them too. So many people known as @ CAPS2 are saying very harsh, secular words that a lot of kids just wouldn't want to hear. Like I said before, because it's bad, it's much better. We have gospel, jazz, @ CAPS3 & @ CAPS4, etc. that a lot of people like to sign up. In conclusion, there are a lot of good things that belong to libraries, but also a lot of bad things. Libraries, in my opinion, should be more careful about what people have access to. Very easily, a young child (who can read) can pick up an adult book, sit in a corner, read, and be exposed to most of the things parents are exposed to. So, in my opinion, yes, there are some things that should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive.

Censorship in libraries is a very controversial subject that has conflicting views. A party in favor of censorship believes that certain literary materials in a library may be offensive to some, and that they should be deleted or censored. The other side, in favor of freedom of expression, believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is considered offensive or not. From these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is evident that censorship should not be instilled in libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions must be respected, and there should be l opportunity to read such a book really from an interested reader. The number one reason why censoring literary material in a library is an unfair enterprise is the right to freedom of expression. This right belongs to all citizens of @ LOCATION1 and should not be taken away because someone @ MONTH1 thinks something is offensive. I have observed that many people will often try to steal this right from people, and this instillation of censorship will do just that from authors. This is the number one reason why censoring literary material in a library is an unfair enterprise. The next reason that censoring literary materials in a library is an unfair business is that this @MON1 censorship mitigates the true expressive meanings and themes that literary works are meant to express. An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous " The @ CAPS1 of @ ORGANIZATION1 ". Such a novel, while sometimes containing offensive language, would not read the same if that language was omitted and deleted. Instead, @ PERSON1's expressions in the story would be immensely toned down and almost silenced. This is the following reason why censoring literary material in a library is an unfair enterprise. The final reason that censoring literary material in a library is an unfair enterprise is that it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader. I have often seen people have a blatant crisis because of an offensive literary work. I've been offended by things I've read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply stopped reading the book or read it anyway. . A person should know that the use of offensive language in literary works is seldom intended to attack the reader, but rather to convey a message with force. If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable job. By remaining calm and passive about these things, he keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for others to read. This is the last reason why censoring literary material in a library is an unfair business. It is clearly evident that removing or censoring literary works in a library is a bad idea overall. The decision to censor literary works would be wrong because it would deprive the author of the right to freedom of expression, weaken the author's true meanings and expressions, and deprive an interested person of the opportunity to read such a work. The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that everyone would regret in the years to come. Therefore, removing or censoring literary works in a library is an unfair enterprise.

Dear editor-in-chief of the newspaper @ PERSON1. Pulling out a book, CD, DVD / VCR, magazine, etc., because they may or may not be offensive or obscene, is a stupid gesture on the part of people who think the world must be perfect when in reality it is so far from perfect that it is disgusting, and yet the sad truth is the fact that only a small percentage of people on the face of the earth have come to accept this truth. If I haven't convinced you otherwise, read on. I believe if the world can't handle what's on the public library shelves, they should just leave it alone and stay in the comfort zone of reading selections. If they are offended, they can go and read elsewhere. I understand that people could have been there first. If so, gently ask the offending person (s) to move elsewhere. The world is by no means a perfect place. The world has its bright spots, like the nations @ CAPS1 and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (@ CAPS2.ATO), but for some reason the world acts like they're going to die if they don't. there was no perfection all around them. This means that they have decided to strip libraries around the world of the offensive and obsessive in all books so that boredom and perfection can slowly but surely take hold in the minds of the world for all to go. Good. Well, I refuse to let it settle in my mind, and I hope you will choose the same for yourself. Your @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4

Reading is something people choose to do for their own entertainment, for fun, to gain personal knowledge and many more reasons. Reading should not be restricted in any way. If a person is interested in a book, they should be able to read it if they want to. I believe that censorship within a library is not something that should be done. For one person to be able to take away another person's right to read a book of their choice is mind-boggling. I know some books can be quite descriptive and graphic, but these limits should be set in a house. If a parent doesn't want their child to read a book, don't blame the whole community. It is not fair to everyone. If you personally cannot find entertainment or pleasure in a book that you find offensive, there are plenty of other alternative books to read. No one is forcing you to be miserable and read a book you don't like, which is why there are a lot of sections in a library. The sections of a library range from mystery to novel, so find a different book and leave the rest to people who like to read them. This way you are happy and everyone else is too. Libraries are places people visit to consult and read books. Usually someone chooses a book because of the cover, or a friend has asked you to read it. If libraries start removing books from the shelves then there will be no left for the rest of us to read. Not only are n't there more books, but also there won't be more libraries for people to go to. Just because a few people think there are offensive words, scenes, and or other ideas in a book does not mean that it is right to take away the privilege of another person to read it. If you have a problem with it, do n't read it. It is that simple. Don't make other book readers suffer because of a people opinion.

I believe that certain books, music, films and other media should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive. We no longer need reasons for people to judge someone based on something they have read. If the media is offensive, someone's feelings will be hurt. I remember a time when I read a book, and there were some really offensive things about the homeless. I felt bad just for reading this, because it made them sound like terrible people. Which is not true in a lot of cases, but I remember people who read it and believed every word. These people now grossly despise them. So why would we allow this book to be in the library? This book changes the way many people think, and so do many other books. There is also a lot of offensive music. Most of the songs people listen to today are, but we just don't realize it. These should not be available in a library, as anyone could rent them. Which is not good, because they could really hurt someone just by singing a song that they think is right. Magazines are another thing libraries need to watch out for. Most magazines agree, but some like to throw out inappropriate little stories. So, to really protect everyone and everyone they need, really go through the magizine and make sure it's not offensive at all. Media, I think libraries really need to sit down and think if they agree or not, these are definitely movies. They need to realize that children can praise them and think they are appropriate. I think libraries should only have family oriented films. This way no one is hurt by anything they see. In conclusion, libraries should be very careful in their choice of media. They should try to limit anything that is offensive, try to prevent anyone from getting hurt

Should we censor libraries? Many people will answer this question differently. I think there should be absolutely no censorship in libraries. Allowing censorship in libraries is an intrusion on our rights. This contradicts the freedom of the press. If someone wants their opinion read, they should have that right. I also believe that censorship in libraries goes against freedom of expression. What is writing if not the written word? If someone wants to say something, they must be able to say it. If a mute person wants to make a point, they must be able to do so by writing. What some people @ MONTH1 find offensive, others @ MONTH1 don't. If anyone finds it offensive, they just shouldn't read it.

" And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us ." This quote says it all, if everyone had a say in what is and what is not offensive then everything would be offensive. Books are often written for the reader's pleasure, and otherwise books are for informational purposes. Not everyone will have the same view of a book as someone else, so it would be unfair not to be able to read it because someone else doesn't want you too. Personally, I like to read books that interest me, as I guess most others do. In general, to keep my attention, I like to read books with a lot of action and an intense storyline. I realize that some people would find this offensive and unacceptable to children, but I now consider myself a good kid and am not adversely affected by the books I read. When I was a kid in @ NUM1 class, I read a book way beyond what most @ NUM1 students read. There were a lot of vulgar words in there and even a racial insult, but I was mature enough to handle them. Just the other year, the librarian, with whom I am in constant contact, asked me if she should remove the book from the shelf. I told him no, because I found it to be a very interesting book! I would have been upset to see a great book no longer be accessible because of vulgar language, because these are only words that express heavy emotion. Many books such as the dictionary or the encyclopedia are used for information purposes. These books are also accessible to children. Myself, when I was a child, I scanned the dictionary for "bad words". Does this justify the deletion? Even the books we read in school today contain “bad words”. When I was in first grade in high school, my teacher @ CAPS1 explained how the school board tried to get rid of "TO @ CAPS2 A @ CAPS3" because it included racial slurs and a lot of racism. She was very against getting rid of the book because she found the novel very interesting for her and her students to read. Books simply cannot be taken out of the hands of high school students because some tense adults think it is offensive when in reality they are teaching good morals and lessons for young people. If you take a look at the politics you can see that not everyone has the same opinion and some can be very loud about theirs. The same idea can go with any topic in the world today. Someone thinks one way and someone else thinks the opposite. This is the problem of removing books from the shelves. One person thinks it is a very offensive book and the other thinks it is a very beneficial book. My personal opinion is that a book is a book and people will interpret it differently. So if a book can be taken off the shelves, it will just set off a chain reaction until every book is gone. There is no interest! If someone is not to read this book, he should not be allowed. The answer is that simple. Ultimately, people are going to have to get over not having what they want because they want a book off the shelf. Most people are offended by something and generally not everyone is offended by the same thing which makes this problem untreatable. There is only one answer to this question: should the library be censored? The answer is no, let it be. The book has been published, so there must be a good reason behind it. In the end, a book is just a book

Have you ever walked into a library and seen a book that you wouldn't want your child or youth to pick up and read ? There are several books in the library that young children should read. I don't think a certified book should be taken out of the library because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children, but there are a few things that can be done to keep these books away from your children or any child. . The possible things that could be done are; move these books to a higher shelf, designate a certified area for these books, or set an age limit for these books. The first way to keep an offensive book out of the reach of your children or other children is to move those books to a higher shelf. This will keep these books out of your child's sight and reach. This will keep them out of the hands of children and prevent them from reading them. The next possibility to keep offensive books out of the hands of your child or any other child is to designate a certain area for these books in the library. Doing this will provide a "barrier" so that you can tell your child to stay out of this area and watch them to make sure they don't go. You would also know where these books are located to make sure they don't go in that area. The last possibility of keeping offensive books out of the reach of your children or any other child is to put an age limit on those books to prevent children from being able to view these books, to read them. This would force children to be a certain age before they could check them out, preventing them from reading them. These are a few possibilities that could be used to keep offensive books out of children's hands and prevent them from reading those offensive books that you wouldn't want them to get their hands on and read.

A lot of people have different opinions about censorship. Some people think there are movies, books, newspapers, etc. that contain topics that are not suitable for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all. Others believe that people have the right to say whatever they want, when they want, on something they think is right or wrong, or very important to them, also known as freedom of speech. Also, people believe that yes there are things written that should not have been written but over which they have no control and for some people @ MONTH1 is appropriate. I believe there are stories written that are not appropriate. But I know that even if I find the topic inappropriate or unnecessary for me, another person will. I know that each person is different and has their own beliefs about different things. If people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers, and movies are in libraries, then @ PERSON1 was right : " We wouldn't have any more books on the shelves for any of us ." Certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines might help some people and be of interest to some people no matter what the topic or how inappropriate @ MONTH1 is as long as they are the right age. If the story is clearly about drugs, sex, alcohol, and veiling without any use, then yes, I think it should be taken off the shelves. You don't know who might get their hands on this movie, book, or article. It could be a little kid and we don't want to open the door for it. People have a lot of different beliefs and I think we shouldn't take anything out of the trade that can be useful to anyone, but I also think there is a certain degree.

Has @ CAPS1 ever used books and movies for entertainment ? Why are we now cautious of @ CAPS1 that our children choose in commerce ? Today's society has changed the way we once viewed our sources of entertainment. Books are now viewed with skepticism and once harmless movies and magazines were full of material that no one should read or watch. Music used to be a beautiful art form, but now when you turn on your radio you hear @ CAPS1 ? Spit without thinking words related to each other with curses and other garbage. Should libraries be cautious when renting something from someone who should not be using that material for harmless entertainment? Once upon a time there was a girl of fourteen or fifteen who loved to read and listen to music. She was smart but shy and used books as friends. Every day she went to the library to find a new story. One day she came across a book on the top shelf of the fiction section. The book looked worn, as its spine was severely cracked and several pages were almost loose. She reached for the book, puzzled, and flipped through the pages. Her innocent and naive mind took hold of a world she did not know. After reading the book, she was full of guilt. It was not a good book, but a book that contained a harmful message. This once outright young girl now knew things that no one at that age should know. So why was there no warning? The difference between writing something offensive and being offensive is that the writer usually doesn't mean to be hurtful or rude. The author most likely wanted the piece of literature to be enjoyed with a clear and playful attitude. However, the comparison between writing something offensive and being offensive is very different. When you read something in a book or magazine that bothers you, put it down or throw it away. No one is forcing you to read the material. Yet the real question is; @ CAPS1 about our children? How do we protect them from offensive literature? And @ CAPS1 on music? Or movies? Do you remember the old black and white movies? How, no matter the plot or the storyline of @ CAPS1, the two lead roles fall in love in the end ? The ending title fills the screen just before the two actors share a kiss, and then the screen goes black. Be careful, there are still films with happy endings and a positive message. @ CAPS1 on other films? Some of the biggest blockbusters are those that have either violence or some form of racism, and / or sexual content. Personally going to the movies to see a new action flick that looks exciting and entertaining should be fun, but where does the fun end? After the guy in the first scene has just been brutally murdered? Or after the two lovers share a special bond that should be kept private? And @ CAPS1 happens when this movie rolls out and rolls out of the library by a young boy who just wants to have a fun sleepover with his friends? How do we keep this kind of material away from them? Libraries should be very careful when printing labels for their books, films, magazines, etc. Librarians should ensure that the book a child gives them is safe to read for that age level. Also, they should check the ratings of the movies or make them inaccessible to certain age groups. Parents should also exercise caution when allowing their child to go to the movies with friends. Make sure they see something fun, but with a positive message. Should libraries remove certain documents from their shelves? I do not think so. However, be careful of @ CAPS1 that you read or watch, as it might not appeal to you. Use the Internet as your source to find reviews on books and magazines, so see how it was rated and decide if it is an amazing read or an intriguing movie. Have fun , but be careful

Books, magazines, and music should be removed if they contain anything offensive to the person or child. Books, magazines, music can make children or adults have a big imagination and as they get older or think it's the right way to do things. All those things that are not intended for proper use should be disposed of if no child or adult is using it. I believe it can bother people as they grow older or adults thinking this is the right way to do things. Books and music should be removed if they are not being used for useful purposes. Magazines of books that have no material use and that are used for pornography or whatever should be taken off the shelves. Children and adults have great imaginations which can sometimes hurt others as well as family members. Magazines of books and music provide inspiration not to come to the point that it is about people's distraction. This is how sometimes not knowing that you are hurting your love because of what you see, read or hear. This can be the biggest effects on people. The supplies you get like books, magazines, and music are not helping you and causing more trouble in your life, they should be taken from the markets. Also, sometimes people have decided to buy them because of what the pictures have in store for you on a good day. another thing that causes them to be taken off the shelves is the thought that you can get by watching, listening and reading. These are all bad things for anyone to be ready or to listen to. I believe that books, magazines, and music should be taken out because it is not good for the brain and it is not helping you in any way. In addition, things that are not used for good are not used to the full. In my opinion, I think books and trashy music can sometimes cause you to stay or do something crazy that you will later regret. use full for one person or child In conclusion, I think that books, magazines, and music that are not full should be taken off the shelves and should put things that help the mind. to be put aside All these things have happened to have no stability in life and missteps that lead you to failure Finally I think all dead end books, magazines and music should be put away

I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive. First, you need to consider what is offensive to most people, and who the people should be to determine whether or not it should be detected. People should be able to decide for themselves whether or not they can get an item off a shelf, because they might not even consider it offensive. If you are a parent, you have the right not to let your children view or read certain materials, but you cannot remove them from the shelf, as this prohibits other people from obtaining the same materials as they think it is acceptable. Things that are offensive range from profanity to extreme violence. Some people @ MONTH1 don't mind there being a few swear words or a bit of violence, but others will find it very offensive. From personal experience, I tend not to think that a little swearing is offensive, but I know people who are reluctant to even hear a small swear word. Many movies these days contain slightly offensive content, but only if you take it seriously. Movies poke fun at things people might find offensive, which probably offends them even more, but they don't have to watch it if they don't want this movie ! It just depends on the person and what they grew up with, or what they think is right or wrong. It is either your own responsibility or the parents' responsibility to determine whether the content of a book or movie is appropriate. Parents often use the argument that children are too young to pass judgment on a book or movie, and it is absolutely true. So, most children's movies and books are appropriate and don't include content that kids aren't quite ready to handle. If you are older, you can probably make the decision to read or watch something because it is more suitable for your age. Many times you have already been exposed to the ideas prevalent in movie books because these things are already in your life. It depends on who the movie is for and what content you think is appropriate for their age. The idea of removing these books from the shelves would be disastrous. Reading lists in schools should be reduced because parents do not approve, and children would lose valuable knowledge that is found in most publications. A person might want to rent their favorite horror movie and suddenly it wouldn't be there anymore because a few people thought it was offensive. There would be nothing left in the libraries if one person did not approve of something because then every item would have at least one person disapproving. banned because a few parents didn't like a thing or two of the book. This book contains many valuable ideas and lessons, and is considered a great piece of literature. These parents wanted the book to be banned in all schools and libraries across the country, which would violate the right to free speech of others. Parents can say whatever they want about the book and not let their own child read it, but they cannot prevent this opportunity for everyone who wants to read the book. Taking it off the shelves would also be removing those ideas. Literature and all other films and types of literature are what shapes a culture. There has been so much movement over time, a lot started with literature and it affected the culture and the people. Censorship would simply take away part of our culture, which would be devastating. You should look at your own life and think about what you find offensive. Then put yourself in someone else's shoes who don't think it's offensive and see if it's worth taking everything away from everyone. Almost anything can be considered offensive to at least one person, but it's your own responsibility to decide if it's appropriate for you or your child. The shelves should be kept full of books, movies, music, and magazines. It's our way of expressing freedom of expression, and it's an integral part of our country and our culture.

Censorship in libraries is good in some ways. People who like to read books should have a wide variety of books. Things that offend people : for example, a book about @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 or the natives and how they were treated so badly. But almost everything today offends people and that's ridiculous. Either way, there will always be something that someone finds offensive. My experience with this situation didn't really bother me. But I was in a library going through a book and read a paragragh and it had the word “ nigger ” in it and found it a little offensive. This word is really not nice. People love different books, movie magazines etc. and some of the greatest movies of all time, well I'm pretty sure some people find them offensive in one way or another. What some might find offensive, others might think differently. Like in magazines, my aunt finds them offensive because of the swimsuit models they contain to advertise a new swimsuit. or to add liqueur. All together pretty much everything is offensive for someone out there. If all the things that people found offensive were to be deleted then there would be hardly any books, movies, etc., and not just that would suck all together.

People should have the right to listen, read and watch what they want. People themselves choose what to read, watch or listen to. They will not be able to change that person by removing offensive movies or books. They will only go elsewhere and do it. People have the right to read, listen and watch what they think is right for them. If others find it offensive, that's their problem. People make their own decisions and that is their right. I think if you tell someone that they can't do a certain thing, that will only make them want to do it more. Taking offensive books, music, movies and magazines will not solve a problem that our society has of being offensive to others, it will only mask it. Taking them out won't suddenly make people stop being offensive to others, they just won't in libraries. Every book, music or movie will be offensive to another person and if we take out all the offensive stuff there will be nothing more to read. It's just something we'll have to deal with. So I don't agree with censorship in libraries. It will only take away our right to read and see what we want, but it will also take away all the offensive movies and books that we have ; which is almost all books. Everyone thinks that one book or another is offensive to them and if we remove these books we will have nothing in our libraries.

censorship No, I don't think they should take certain books off the shelves, there are a lot of things that can be found offensive; gangs, politics, race, even the school small children attend. I can understand that you want to keep your kids safe, but you can't stop them from everything. Downtowns have gangs who correct dreadful words on trains, buildings, and about anything they can. and you can't just take that off the shelf. Politics can be the worst, in presidential elections they always have to talk about their skin color and all they can find out about the other person. All your kids are watching this on TV. Race wars can escalate, people all over the world are fighting just because of the color of their skin. You can't take them out of it either, it's an ongoing battle that will never be one and it will only keep getting worse. I can't speak for the other schools, but mine has a lot of little problems; the little kids swear, the older ones fight, then there are the people who try to do good in school and get bullied for it. You cannot hide your children forever, sooner or later they will discover these problems. If you want to help your children not to see them on the street, because reading it in a book is much better than them seeing it in the real world. You have to prepare them for the problems ahead, and if you don't, they could be much more hurt than the little words in a book, magazine, or movie.

In the book fahernheit @ NUM1 all the books are burnt no matter what is in them and people are always sad and depressed about everything. Books are an integral part of our lives. Some material needs to be censored as it might offend some people who are all ready to have a hard time being who they are without these things to add to the flame. There are books that are censored for little or no reason. There may be a rude or misunderstood word that made the books unnecessary. Censorship is important to libraries when used correctly. We need books for many things, from learning to just using time. Music has been with humanity from the start. Movies show us the ups and downs of life. Magazines keep us informed about what's new and interesting. These things have become important to us as clothing and food. Just taking them out will make the world a darker place to live. Some of these things will offend people without trying to be. Katherine Paterson says that if I had the right to get rid of a book that offended me, so will everyone and soon all the books will be gone. no matter what we do or say. Should we get rid of everything for this reason?

What is censorship? Many would say that this is a book without bad words or that it is a film without racism. For me, I think censorship obscures the truth. I don't think movies or books should be taken away from oneself because some people find it offensive. When a book uses a curse to show anger or just use the word I think it's okay because isn't that already what we hear in the world? Now I know some people @ MONTH1 didn't grow up hearing bad words, but a lot of us did. With movies, I think if people have a problem with their kids watching something bad or offensive, they shouldn't let their kid watch it. This is what's wrong with people now, they don't want to be blamed for the things that are going wrong in their life. People use censorship as a way to feel like good parents or that the world owes them something. When it comes to someone who thinks a movie or book has gone too far with their race, the censorship is on. Many people have issues with their race or nationality. Although it's funny to see this breed using these rude words among themselves, but when it's in a book, it's racism. Or when a certain race is mocked or shown in a movie in a way that race doesn't feel comfortable with, that movie is branded as racist. I think if people have a problem with something that they don't agree with, then they should take it out of their own lives. Too many people are trying to control something, like censorship. For years people have wanted books read in school to be censored for bad language. Why spend all this time on book censorship and not on school. I know kids at school use bad language all the time. Even worse than the books we read. If adults realized that it is their children that they should censor and not books, then censorship would not have become such a huge problem. People just need to realize that condemning books or movies doesn't make offensive words or bad pictures go away, it just covers them up.

Take books off a shelf in libraries because someone thinks they are offensive ? I don't think it's fair. It's just what one person thinks and other people I'm sure won't think the same. Just because a person thinks something is offensive and should be taken off this shelf doesn't mean a child couldn't learn from this book. Also with music, movies, and magazines you can get it everywhere else so why is it such a bad thing to have a library ? A lot of kids go to libraries to find the books they need for school and if people take books from the shelves that they need, then how are they supposed to do their jobs? I'm sure there are people out there who would say the books they need are something they shouldn't learn yet, but we'll have to learn some someday, so why not now? Take music? kids can just access and get to the internet just as easily and most kids do it in ways that might get them into trouble. So having music in libraries only gives them a free way to get it. Magazines that you can just go to a store and get, but a lot of kids probably don't have the money to buy them, so having them in a library would give them a way to be able to see them. As long as these are things the kids can see, I can't see what's wrong with the libraries that have them there. So I think taking books, music, magazines, and movies away from libraries is not a very good thing to do. Maybe they could create an adult zone and if someone tells them they think a book should go there, they can go through it and see if they should. I can see some things are taken away but not a lot and if you take all of that away from a library you don't really have much library anymore.

I think if it's offensive it shouldn't be available to kids until they're old enough to read it, listen to it. I think they need to be taken off the shelves or put away. Because it can be hurtful, dirty for young children and it could be avoided if taken off the shelves. I believe magazines can be tucked away or placed in their own sections. Music or movies could also be placed in their own sections. Internet may be blocked for some websites. Fortunately, the times we live in have people to prevent these things from happening as adults. And the people who are looking at you and may tell you that you are too young for that stuff. This is what I think it could be easily prevented from just putting them on or taking them out and taking them off the shelves. If they're offensive, delete them so we don't have to worry about whether kids are reading them or not.

Dear Diary, I would like to start by saying that books, music, movies, magazines etc. are great for kids in libraries. It's great that the kids have a place to go in their free time when they have nothing else to do or need a place to read. But some things are not suitable for young children and young adults. In high school, just by walking down the hall, you'll discover more things than you probably want to know. A lot of them @ MONTH1 aren't appropriate, but every time you walk into the library it's almost like they're promoting drugs, alcohol, and sex. Books on drugs are acceptable to some extent, as if they were drugs. But every time they talk about how drugs relieve pain and improve everything, that's when it goes too far. Our children and future children do not need to learn this stuff. Alcohol is the same. You see alcohol everywhere and kids drink it at a young age because movies, music, books, etc. promote it. Our children don't need to learn this stuff. We need them to learn about the dangers of alcohol, not how to get drunk and what to do when drunk. Ads are the worst things kids can see, especially when they're on billboards, magazine fronts, etc. Children don't need to learn these things at such a young age. Children need to be persuaded to play outside, play sports and have fun with the family, or ride a bicycle. I think these things should be removed from libraries if they are offensive to some people. Because maybe it's for the best that these things are taken off the shelves because maybe our kids will be healthier and live longer without being influenced or pressured to use drugs, alcohol, etc. Sincerely, @ PERSON1

I am sending you this letter about my take on censorship in libraries. Some people think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are offensive. These things can be offensive to them, but not to others. So you have to consider it not only from your point of view, but also from the point of view of others. I think they shouldn't be taking these things off the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view, like my mom for example, she loves vampire books and movies, but I love tragedy. Seeing everyone likes something different. They should also think about the books we have from @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ NUM1, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ NUM2, etc., are offensive to some people. Shall we get these books out. I mean, if we took books, music, movies, magazines, etc., because they were offensive, then we wouldn't have any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Everyone thinks something is offensive, some might think the same is offensive some maybe something different is offensive. We should not remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the shelves. I understand that people don't want children to see or hear them. Yet it is part of life. You can't take everything out to make one person happy because it might drive another person crazy

Libraries are normally a quiet and safe place where people can sit, have a cup of coffee and read a book / magazine, search the internet or listen to favorite music. But, some people don't use it like that. They think this is the time to mess around and disrespect other people who are trying to have time for themselves while the kids are away or have had a bad day and get together and hang out. prepare for the next day. But then we wonder why people want to sit in a library and read. Why can't they just check out a book, CD, or magazine and take it home ? Why do people think it's so important to be able to browse books, magazines, music, and movies from the library ? I don't see what it is! Most counties have a public library. This means that they will accept anyone interested in looking at things there. Yes, I can see libraries forcing the person viewing a book to sign a letter or document, giving out personal information like a phone number, address, or credit card number. The letter would say they have so much time with this book and need it by a certain date or else they have to bring it back to renew so that they can't accuse anyone of stealing a book if they want it a little longer. Most places have what they call late fees. Normally if someone has late fees you won't get that book back because they don't want to pay it so I feel like if you give them a credit card number they can just continue to charge their account and collect the money that way for late fees. Because they just can't answer your phone call or they can just throw a letter they get in the mail from the library in the trash. I know our school library here at @ ORGANIZATION1 has always had issues collecting books and not paying late fees. This problem is sometimes a never-ending process with some people because some of them don't care. Yes, the Internet would be a little different because not everyone has the money to have the Internet at home. I'm not writing this letter to bitch or be boring, I'm trying to tell you some of my ideas that I need to keep a library up and running and not all of the junkey. My ideas to me are good ideas and I feel like we can put the libraries to good use in this county and @ LOCATION1

People find things offensive every day. It's just a matter of life. Some people have the right to feel offended for certain reasons, but they really can't stop that from happening. It's just something that's happened for thousands of years. And people slowly started to face it. Therefore, I believe that books and other material that is found to be offensive should not be removed because it offends someone, as removing it might offend someone else. What I'm really trying to get across is that not everyone will be happy anyway. Life is filled with society and mixed emotions, so not everyone will agree on the same thing. In addition, it should be up to the library to decide whether or not it wishes to remove some of its material. Because they paid for it and have the right to let people in society watch it, read it or listen to it. That being said, I think they should try to keep some offensive elements to a minimum. Like racism, it seems racism still has an impact on much of the country today. And that will always be a growing problem in the issues around @ CAPS1. In conclusion, I think the library has the right to own somewhat offensive books or films. Because like I said, everyone takes care of it at some point, and not everyone can be happy. And some of the material is most likely educational and teaches us the history of @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS1, ect, rather than being racist or offensive when everyone is jumping to conclusions. And everyone has to go beyond the offensive side and reach a level where everyone is in agreement. Because we are all the same, yet still separated by looks and culture

Libraries are for everyone, from children to adults. There is @ MONTH1 something that shouldn't be in some areas or even in place at all. With librarys having all age groups of books, there should be @ MONTH1 or something in thoes areas for them to see. let alone @ MONTH1 wouldn't even be there to start. Any age of child can pick up material that @ MONTH1 contains either offensive / or just things they shouldn't see. I think libraries should only contain material suitable for all age groups. This is my oppion why I think librarys should only have material with approiate pictures and words for all age groups. You don't know what child @ MONTH1 your or someone EAL pick up and read or hear. The beat thing to do is have all the appropriate materials and EAL nothing

Should certain books, films, and magazines be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive ? I think libraries should remove offensive material. Libraries are huge public places that share knowledge and entertainment with huge groups of people who want to expand their knowledge. All over @ LOCATION1 and other countries there are libraries that contain offensive material. Now, I am a firm believer in throwing out these offensive objects because little children might pick one up in their hands, there might be some people who can be swayed into doing silly activities that they've learned, and some people might. steal these items for themselves. Libraries are important resources that tons of different groups of people come to enjoy, relax and reflect on. Now all over the world libraries have offensive material that should be taken off their shelves. Small children and their parents come to the library because a library is a great way to relieve stress and allow children to learn. Say there is some material that is not suitable for children, so they grab it and start reading. The next thing you know, your kids will have this kind of knowledge, and there's nothing you can do about it. Offensive material is for small children and parents don't even know it. They might pick up offensive language or talk about it in school, and this material might spread. This kind of material in the library can harm children's brains by brainwashing them. Adolescents are reaching an age where they could do something regrettable. Teens often go to the library to meet up with friends or start their homework. Then an immature person spots a book and begins to read. After that, he or she thought it was extremely funny and wants to try it at home, but he or she is seriously injured. Teens can be influenced by anything and the worst part is that it can start in the library. Then there are people who come into a library and steal offensive material for themselves. People like that are immature and could be a real problem for the library. Once this object is within reach ; they could post it on the Internet and show the world what he or she found. Offensive material could easily be stolen from a library ; if these certain items weren't in the library, then the rebels wouldn't steal anything from the library. Libraries are for different people who want to learn and teach others their new knowledge. Libraries have the absolute best resources that a place could have or ever wanted. I don't want such a wonderful resource to be tainted by these materials of absence. This is why I firmly believe that certain material such as books, magazines, films and music which are offensive should be removed from libraries.

Some people believe that certain documents, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive. However, I don't think they should be deleted. People are mature enough to be able to deal with offensive material. Most people look at books or movies that they have heard of, so for the most part they know what they are reading @ MONTH1 is offensive. Instead of removing offensive content, there should simply be a warning to let readers know that what they are viewing is considered offensive. These days people are mature enough to read offensive material. We see many types of offensive material every day. Examples of this include when we watch the news we @ MONTH1 see a lot of offensive photos or videos. There are also many reports that many people find offensive. When someone views an offensive book, they are doing it because they want to. Libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read whatever he wants. Before reading a book or movie, a person should examine it to make sure that they are okay with what they are getting. This can avoid many problems. For example, suppose a young reader sees a book that they find interesting. If they don't read it a bit and take it home, they @ MONTH1 later find out that it contains offensive material. However, if they read a bit about it before checking it out, they will find out that it contains offensive material and can then decide whether they still want to read it or not. There are many ways libraries can prevent children or others who are not mature enough to view offensive material from viewing it. They can put a warning label on the book or movie to let people know that that particular item is considered offensive. Libraries could even impose an age limit on viewing offensive material. Either of these ideas could be an effective way to ensure that only middle-aged people check out anything that is considered offensive. Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the shelves. containing offensive material. If a person wishes to consult an offensive book, they should be allowed to consult and read it. Also, people should be smart enough to review anything they check out ahead of time so that they can be aware of offensive content. However, to make things even easier, libraries might simply put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it.

Censorship in libraries today, I believe, is not a big deal. But many would disagree with this. Books and movies can be a very important resource for anyone of any age. They can give us facts on a certain topic that we @ MONTH1 can't find anywhere else. Everyone has their own definition of offensive. I believe that it is not only up to the library to assess offensive books, films and magazines, but it is also the participants who use these resources. For many children, regardless of their age, they only rent books from the library for two main reasons: fun and projects. To feel a book by a teenager or a child is rather an invitation to see what it contains. For people who love to read, they mostly stick to one type of genre. If someone wanted to rent a book and it was not appropriate for them to read it, then the librarian or the teacher would prohibit them from that book. For projects, like for school, it would depend on the librarian to censor the book to a child. But books are not classified the way movies are. It all depends on the use of the book and the maturity of the person renting it. If they feel that it won't be appropriate for some, then they might suggest censoring it. Movies and books are different in many ways. Books allow you to create a mental description and a picture in your mind of what you read. Movies, on the other hand, create a visual image right in front of your eyes. No matter how horrible or vile a book's description may be, it still doesn't compare to the visual image of a video. Movies are categorized today based on a person's age, and they explain why they are categorized as such. Films classified above the @ NUM1 level are usually not kept in libraries. They @ MONTH1 will still be censored if they create an image that's too vile, but that depends on who is looking at it. Music is an important part of each of our lives, and without it the world would be a whole different place. Everyone is very fond of a certain genre of music and sticks to it most of the time. Music, like movies, is also rated by song content. If it has a word or two that should be detected, then it is most likely already labeled " explicit ." I think music, just like movies, shouldn't be able to be censored because it is already rated accordingly. Some books, magazines, and movies contain cold, hard facts about the last years of our world and are too vile for anyone. And even though these events are in our past, they are still very important to our present. Books can be a magical place for children and adults to create their own world. To censor a book, film or magazine would be depriving someone of that chance to enjoy life a little more for that little moment in time.

My opinion on this subject is not correct. This is a very interesting question. And I'll tell you why I think the way I do. I am for and against. Okay, some people like different things and some disagree about that. This is how things work. If a parent walks their kid through the mall and walks into a music store and hears the music swearing in it, I wouldn't want my kid around and that's what it means removing something like that because that someone is offended. I totally agree with that. Like cigarettes. The children come in to buy candy, then they go to pay for it and the back wall is full of tobacco products that the children can see. Again, I would like to take this off the shelves. There would be so much conflict if that happened. Everyone likes different things. So I think everyone will take offense by removing things that they think are offensive. It goes from children to adults. All ages would be embarrassed by that. Here is my counter-opinion on this subject. It would drive me very mad if I admired something very much and then found out that someone is offended by it, then they take it away from people and love this item. All of this would only cause problems for everyone and just make everything go wrong. This is how it is supposed to be. We all have opinions. We all like different things. We all have to get over this if we don't like it or get along with it. It is something that we have to take and aspire to. So on this subject I am for both. I see it both ways because it's good and bad. People are just going to have to get over the fact that they have to face what they see or hear. Its part of life.

I believe that some materials should not be removed if they are deemed inappropriate. There are several things that explain why I think this. On the one hand, some libraries do not have certain kinds of books. For example, say one library @ MONTH1 has action but no thriller while another library has thriller but no action. If certain materials were removed from public libraries due to censorship, people would only be able to find them online or in certain stores. The second reason is that children would not go into these kinds of books if it was inappropriate, unless they had parental approval. If these materials were to always be on the shelves, you should at least be a certain age to read them, unless parents go to places where their children do not need to get their approval first. Of course, that would make the library more kid-friendly, but a book shouldn't be kept away from a kid just because of a few swear words. Finally, some adults would be unhappy with the removal of certain books. Some books that are intended would be better to stay in the library. If they were to remove these books, then adults would have to find a book online. So censorship, for me, won't make any difference. If this continues, @ MONTH1 leads so far, that the libraries should be closed. Take my word for it. In conclusion, don't let censorship invade our libraries.

Censorship for most people means much more than the average word with NUM1 syllable. It means giving up the right to say and think as you see fit. For the most part, this idea is not a good idea. When one is censored, they essentially give up the right to liberty of @ CAPS3. In this essay, I will discuss three disadvantages of censorship in libraries. One of the reasons censorship should not be spoken out loud in libraries is the lack of freedom of @ CAPS3. Decades ago, when it was put in place that anyone could exercise their right to speak out aloud, the idea of censorship was not in the plan. As @ CAPS1, it is our right to speak and write as we wish without reproach, however offensive or not offensive the @ MONTH1 material is. Like @ CAPS1, everyone should realize that everyone is different and not everyone will agree with each other. Does that mean that just because a person finds something offensive, an item needs to be taken off the shelves ? Absolutely not. The freedom of @ CAPS3 is our birthright and we should be out loud to say or write anything without being censored. " ... But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you have the exact same right and everyone else too." And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. Catherine Paterson. Author Katherine Paterson simply states that if she has the right to take any book off the shelf that she doesn't like, then everyone has the same right. As stated earlier in the paragraph above, it doesn't make sense to throw away a book just because someone finds it offensive. If so, I might find @ NUM2 books in our library that I find offensive, and the next person might find offensive @ NUM3 books, etc. Just as Katherine says, "And then we don't have any more books on the shelves for any of us." And the last downside to censorship in libraries is the lack of perspective and learning from a book. As an avid reader of books, I couldn't even begin to describe all the vocabulary words and new things I was learning while reading a book. Just recently I read the book @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5. As I read I started to have a deep hatred for the main character. I later found the book to be incredibly offensive. However, upon reading it, the book provided a lot of information about @ DATE1's life that I knew nothing about. It gave me a lot of information that I still use today. The book got me thinking about myself and how @ NUM4 plus years change people, specifically @ CAPS1. In conclusion, censorship in libraries is not a good idea. When you are censored, you give up your right to the freedom of @ CAPS3, other books in general, and the loss of the opportunity to learn new things. I hope that with this essay I have convinced you or at least informed you about the downsides of censorship in libraries

Is there enough censorship in our libraries? Have you ever come across a vulgar or offensive book in your library hoping no child has ever read it? Well this should never happen, if a book or any other material is offensive it should be placed in a separate area of the library where only adults can access it. Other than this section, it shouldn't be any offensive or vulgar material that children or even young teens should be able to see. Almost every day, children and teens have access to offensive and vulgar material that could have terrible effects on them. Maybe if they don't see these offensive materials when they are young, they will be less likely to use or engage in some of the things they see or read. For example, when teenagers read articles about people who use drugs, it might encourage them to engage in these types of activities as well. Materials might not have an effect right away, but later on it might have a giant effect on them. Youth is what will rule this country when we are old. So we must do our part and keep offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of our children and adolescents. I don't want my kids to read some of the things I read when I was young. That's why I think there should be censorship in every library.

Books I think all the books in the world should be on the shelves. because if it's afencive then don't read it. it's much better if you can go read all the books you want. and if you don't have that book then i guess you have to go get it somewhere else and some people wouldn't give themselves all these problems for a book. Which means they won't know as much as they wanted or could know. we need smart people to know all there is potential and what they can and can know. But books are books, not everyone reads a lot of books. let's say you wanted to know something about a truck, what do you want go find a book about it or log in or ask someone who knows. How could anyone know anything about it if the person who loaded the truck hadn't written a book to tell you about the truck. You would need to take it apart and find yourself, which is not easy at all. and if you are wrong it is not good. but if you had a book to review it would make things a lot simpler most of the time. This is one of the reasons every book should be on the shelf. so that if you need to know something and want to learn something, you can read about it. And find out what you want to know. Reading is one of the best ways to find out what you're looking for so that no one is telling you wrong. Plus, books are just good to read Movies All movies should be there because every body has the right to watch any movie it wants. Inles, they're not old enough. and if no parent has to say, it's ok for them to watch it. If that bothers you, don't watch it. Magizines @ CAPS1 are good for reading a lot of magazines that you can find a lot on anything in a magazine. so how are you

Do I think that some documents like books, music, movies, magazines etc. should be deleted because they are offensive ? No I do not. My opinion of the varieties of things found in our library is good. Most of it is very useful information. Some people may dislike certain things because of or about what is in them, but most are history. You cannot change that. If someone doesn't like a book, movie, or magazine, they shouldn't be reading it. I have found things in our libraries to really help with a lot of projects. If we need to know more about slaves or slavery, we can go to our library. The point of view of some people on this subject is totally different, but good. We cannot help what people have done in the past. We can only learn from their mistakes. I'm saying if you don't like what you see on the front of the cover, don't read it. Look for something else that is more interesting for you. I did not find anything offensive to me in our library. Or even bad. They have books on everything. Some of it might be bad, but most of the time it's good information. They talk about history, weapons and drugs, wars and all kinds of other historical information. There are books about things that aren't even true. I think people @ MONTH1 are overreacting on some things. If you don't like a book or movie, don't get it. Take a look at the cover and if it looks appealing to you, get it. But if not, don't waste time complaining. Because then things can get out of hand. This is my take on books, movies, magazines, etc. in our libraries. Usually they seem very helpful, but others may have different opinions.

I think there shouldn't be any books taken off the shelves. Something may be offensive to some people, but others may need these books for research, projects, etc. People need to read to understand why some people think something is offensive to other people. Each book should be on a shelf in a public library. Everyone has the freedom to choose for themselves, let them decide if it is offensive to themselves and to others. Maybe an author has written a book about gansters and their children. Maybe the author wrote the book to give you a glimpse into someone's life. We live in a very diverse world, they are going to have different perspectives on the world. The author might be writing the book to show you what this child went through at this point in his life with murder and violence. It shouldn't offend anyone because it's about murder and violence. Reading this book should allow you to see how this child grew up. The book might even change the mind of some parents of kids who are in gangs. It might help them realize how much effect it will have on their child's life later in life. I believe the same goes for movies and magazines. Reading magazines and watching movies might help. Let's say if you are in a gang and watch movies and read you will find out what is happening to the gang, it might change your thoughts. These books, movies, magazines could show what is going to happen to you. Maybe directors / writers are doing these kinds of things to show you what will happen to you if you continue down the path of harmful gangs and clubs. Why should some people choose if a book, movie, magazine, etc. is offensive to some people but not to others ? I think the only way to fix this is to leave every book on the shelves of public libraries. Let the people who come to the library to read books decide what is right or offensive for them to read. Even if the library makes a decision, someone will get angry and angry. I don't think there is a way to solve a problem like this except to let people read and decide for themselves. If they like the book, if not, do n't reread it or return the book. No one can decide right from wrong for someone, only you can do it for yourself.

Hello @ ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to talk about censorship in libraries. In libraries there are tons of material whose language and pictures are offensive. I have a broad vision on this subject. My point is that if things censor in a library, television should censor. I have deaf parents, so we always have the captions in our house. Every day I see bad language that is not censored. I have also seen images that are not censored. Young people in those days mostly watched television rather than using the library. So why not censor television. I see things on TV that I won't see in a library. In my conclusion, I would like to say that I do not believe that libraries should censor their material because the student will always find out. There are plenty of other places that are worse. Like crime scenes, movie scenes have blood and blood, and a library would have only one language. These are my opinions and yours could be different.

"We can all think of a book that we hope none of our kids or other kids have taken off the shelves - that job I hate - then you have the exact same right as well and everyone else too." And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. Katherine Paterson, an author, once said. I think she was trying to tell us that some books shouldn't be on the shelves for kids to read. I agree with her on this statement. I once read a book with very mature content. It was very vulgar and not suitable for my age or maturity. There are a lot of books like this and we have to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read adult acts such as: war, violence, sex, drugs and all kinds of other things. If we take these adult books and other types of media off the shelves, our children will have better lives. There would be less teenage pregnancy, drug use and many other factors that affect our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so influenced by the media. I don't think we should get rid of those pounds though. We should just keep them out of libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books, they should look elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of that content and put them in a separate magazine or section in libraries. A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media. But she also said that people who read or watch this type of media have every right to do so. This is why there must be an age limit on this type of media. But for now, if the content is intended for adults or not for you, don't read or watch it.

We've all been to a library at some point in our lives. Have you ever looked around and seen something @ MONTH1 was offensive, or something you didn't agree with ? What if you were lucky enough to have if you took off the shelves for good? Or, what if someone else had a choice? Would you allow them to do so? In my opinion, I would say no. Someone is not allowed to remove reading material from the shelves just because @ MONTH1 is offensive to them, or their lifestyle. I say if you don't like it don't watch it its that simple. For example, what if you like rap or hip hop culture and someone finds it shocking ? Would you give them the right to hide it from you? Or would you really like to do this to someone else? Let's say you're a Christian and an atheist finds the @ CAPS1 offense, or untrue, so he takes it off the shelves. Does this suit you? If someone didn't like a certain topic or culture, or found it offensive, all they would have to do is just steer clear of it. The point is, if we all had to take something off the shelves, eventually there would be nothing left. Respect what other cultures and ways of life are doing and stay away from what offends you. Would you like someone to have what you love on the shelves ? I wouldn't, so you shouldn't do this to other people.

Looks like today we're trying to censor everything, but are we going too far? Could it be that we have crossed the line and are no longer protecting children, but rather holding back our society as a whole? In my opinion, the censorship of literature has crossed the line. A library is, in essence, an incredibly valuable resource for every generation. In some cases this is still the case, but when books are withheld, the fact that @ MONTH 1 offends someone, we prevent people from knowing what knowledge they could gain through the work of the literature itself. same. We try to appease everyone in today's society, so we censor several things that are not politically correct. If future generations are unable to learn what we have from these writings, then they will not have the insight we have gained. Another reason is, to be perfectly honest, that history and society have not - and very well @ MONTH1 never really been - politically correct. People are outraged by certain words, and as a result, some libraries will remove the book containing those words from their shelves. Once that was done, what did we really accomplish? Have we made the world a better place by trying to hide part of the story? It's debatable, but at the same time, at school, you have to learn about @ CAPS1 despite the fact that it bothers a lot of people. We have to learn about it because it was such an important part of history to be remembered in the hope that nothing as terrible as this happens again. So if we learn an entire topic that happened in another country but affected the whole world, shouldn't we be learning our own faults in history? The days when we oppressed people, the terms we used so commonly that we try to hide them now. Did it really help us? No, because until people recognize a problem and remember how bad it was, they won't understand it. Napoleon once said that history is a history written by the victor, but is victory so sweet after our history has been rewritten? If anything that offends people is censored or taken away, we will have nothing. Because if one person says out loud what is acceptable and what is not acceptable, then others will participate as well. It would become a new fad and people would find a problem with just about anything. So essentially, by censoring works in libraries, we are withholding future generations from whatever they might be. We force them to ignore social issues. Ultimately, we have to ask ourselves, was it really worth it? I remind you, a library is an invaluable resource.

When people think of a library, they think of a quiet place to study and read. Teachers use libraries for many different things. One thing they use it for is movies on certain topics. Another is for books on certain people or certain events. They even use it to get magazines for projects and to catch up with the world outside of school. So what's my take on removing offensive material ? I'll tell you what it is. Children watch movies in class all the time. Some are not appropriate at times, but some are very unusual and useful. I think if the teacher watches the movie first and thinks it's a pity for elementary kids, for example, it should be banned from that school's library, but for high school kids there are strong chances that they have heard or seen worse. So saying that movies should stay in high school libraries but not all of them should stay in elementary schools. Books are another good resource if used correctly. They help the children of history learn about ancient war heroes and past events. Some books should be kept behind the counter and used only for certain lessons. Like for example books that tell details about drugs. They should be removed from the shelves, placed behind the counter ; and if anyone really needs a book about themselves, like for medical purposes, to be a doctor, all they have to do is ask. Magazines are good for a couple of different good things. One thing is projects. If you have to do a project on something like food and can't use a computer, magazines are a great way to get good photos. Another thing that it is commonly used for is entertainment in its own right. Like when you are bored of reading a book you just chose because of its looks or if a book is too difficult to read, you might get a magazine. So in reality some things should be kept and some things removed. People spend a lot of time in the library for a lot of different things and that will never change. Movies are a good source of entertainment and that won't change either. So I guess I'm half and half to keep or get rid of the offensive material.

My point of view is against the open distribution of certain newspaper articles. There are certain articles, radio shows, and other media sources that vividly describe certain things that happen in the news that I find inappropriate for certain people, such as young children or people who disagree with them. having to listen to things such as: biased reactions, opinions and interpretations of these things. The open distribution of newspaper articles and things containing disturbing images should be censored. I recently saw pictures of people who were killed while searching for @ LOCATION1. I find these @ MONTH1 pictures to be of some importance to those interested, but for kids who can stare on their doorstep and look at the newspaper, may see some horrible pictures that some people @ MONTH1 think they shouldn't. not be exposed. Even as adults, people don't necessarily agree with this. The adults @ MONTH1 see what's going on in the news and @ MONTH1 find it intriguing for them or quite disturbing, but as far as the protection and limited exposure of their children @ MONTH1 is concerned, it is not @ MONTH1 such a good thing for their children to hear. I was in the car coming home from school one day, and my dad had just picked me up from school, and I run the raido from am to fm like I always do when I get in the car , but I did not hear the sudden appearance of a top hundred song as I expected, I heard a woman express her opinion on the death of @ LOCATION1 to a radio host. The show had already been taped, and so after the woman went on a rampage for being so angry with it all, there was a review of the other calls that other people had made with mad frustration over the comments. women. She had said earlier that it was wrong to have killed someone, in which the host of a radio talk show replied with the argument that it was okay for @ LOCATION1 to kill thousands of people , but we can't kill him. The reviews the other callers had made kind of bothered me. The appellants' words were very offensive to the woman who had expressed her feelings. The other callers said she had to leave our country and cursed her. News like the death of @ LOCATION1 is not only violent in itself, but also creates very violent reactions. Another instance where I was exposed to reports that @ MONTH1 was not well accepted by others was when we were having an assembly meeting at my school and we watched a video of a protest against the people of belief @ CAPS1. The whole problem with the protest was that people of the faith @ CAPS1 were born at @ LOCATION3 and were meeting with representatives to help a poor community at @ LOCATION2. Although they made an effort to help poor and homeless communities at @ LOCATION2, there were people shouting in the anti-im protest to leave and return to where they came from. When people hear things about it in the news it can be very offensive because although @ MOIS1 is happening on a completely opposite coast it could affect someone, it can easily affect someone who doesn't understand the previous conflicts that would have shaped the opinions of these people and @ MONTH1 takes this very offensive because it is a very complex question although it is still very wrong. I think material that is exposed to people of all ages should be censored, because material that is openly distributed now is not necessarily suitable for everyone, and some people @ MOIS1 don't want to hear about it, and want to avoid the news circulating on certain topics with which they @ MOIS1 are not comfortable

I think if a book can be published it should be able to be in a library. If a book is published it means it's open to the public so I don't see why it can't be in libraries. If a book needs to be taken out of a library, why did they buy it ? I really don't see the need to take a book off the shelves of a library. If someone doesn't like it, they don't have to get it. I think only the library owner should be the one to take a book off a shelf because it's their own store, but why would they waste money buying the book. The public should not be able to remove books from libraries because not everyone likes the same kind of books. Everyone also has different points of view. If someone could remove books from the libraries, there would be no books in the library. A book is a book. Not a criminal, so why remove books from libraries? If a book can be published, it can be put in the library. There is no reason why a book should be taken off the shelves because it has been published and therefore is already open to the public.

I don't think a magazine should be taken off the shelves just because someone is offended. People get offended all the time, but do you see them trying to get what made them fall like this. I've been offended by cartoons before, but you don't see me cry about it, you just have to aspire and live on. Cartman from the TV show @ LOCATION1 is the most offensive character on this show. It uses all the offensive languages known to mankind. He laughs at all races, he says he hates everyone the same way. But you still can't stop it, it's like trying to turn a dog into a cat, it just won't happen. It is also like trying to get rid of racecism. This is what I think to find something offensive.

When you walk into your local library, there are thousands of books, magazines, movies, etc. You have different types and styles of books. There is fiction and non-fiction, comedy, horror, children's books and many more. Also, what you might not know is that some libraries have books that are either sexual, violent, disruptive, and not suitable for young children. They might also have movies and magazines like that and that's not a good influence. When a young child walks into a library, they expect to find a book with color, action, pictures, etc. But while he is browsing, he may come across a certain book that is not intended for him and influenced. An inappropriate book for a child could possibly affect a child's life as he might come out into reality and try to emulate a book he has read and that could end up being a bad decision. Inappropriate films and magazines, such as magazines or pornographic images, rated @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2, should not be allowed in a library. Such items should be sold in a separate store. Articles like these are intended for adults only. We should try to inspire our young children to do what is right and not try to convince them to do anything in a negative way. If you plan to keep any of these items in your home, keep it in a place where children cannot find them. The generation we live in now, most of the young people focus only on gang fiddling, sex, rap music, and drugs and you can find all of this material in movies, books, and songs. If we keep all of these negative items out of public places such as libraries and even homes, then there could be changes. Most of the rap songs you hear these days are about violence, sex, or drugs. Most music should have a positive message. I feel like if I see a book, movie, magazine, etc., sitting on a shelf where a youngster can see it, I think I should have the right to take it down because the company doesn't It's more like it used to be and if we make a change like this then I feel that some things can change. Even though I'm still young, I think my generation of teenagers should stop all violence and stop being influenced by everything they see or hear, and if we focus on the most important things in life, then this world can be a whole other place.

Censorship in libraries can be good and bad. I think this is because there may be things you @ MOIS1 don't want your kids to read. But there can also be things you want them to read. Age groups can play a big part in censorship because there are things you don't want to see a child read when they are young. But if it's censored, they won't even be able to read it as they get older. It all depends on the kinds of things that are in books, music, movies, and magazines. If you find something offensive that you've read in a book or seen in a magazine to certain people, @ MONTH1 won't be offensive at all. That's why I think censorship can be good and bad. I'm sure there is @ MOIS1 something you read that didn't offend you, but @ MOIS1 is still offensive to others. In my opinion, censorship can be a good thing when the things that are in the book, movie, magazine and music are not true and @ MONTH1 is offensive to more than a small group. Let's say there are two books written on the same real subject. The material from the first book is very well written and @ MONTH1 contains offensive material here and there. The second book is also well written but @ MONTH1 will not all be there the whole story @ MONTH1 will not be the same as what happened because they censored it because it cannot be in the library. Which do you prefer to read? Personally, I would rather read the book which @ MONTH1 contains offensive material but tells the full story of what happened. Let's say you were the author of a book and it took a lot of hard work and dedication to finish the book and get it published. Would you like your book to be on the library shelf ? I know I would, but if you write about something that has happened in your life that might have offended others, they @ MONTH1 are not allowing that book on a library shelf. Whether the things in the book are true or are in real life. So why show your children a book that is not true? I'm not saying go get your child a war book and have him read when he's very young. When you read a book that someone has spent a lot of time and a lot of hard work on, you are examining their perspective. Maybe the perspective of what happened is very different from yours, but it can be a good thing. Even with offensive material, books, movies, magazines, and music can still be good for some people and bad for others. I went to libraries and found some books that interested me and I think some of them might be offensive to others. If the content of the book, movie, magazine, and music is not true and can be deemed offensive, then it should be censored. But if it's censored, it should only be censored for a certain age group. I also went looking for books from the library that have true stories that some people may find offensive, but that doesn't mean they should be censored. A book in which @ MONTH1 contains material that some people might find " bad ". That's not to say that after reading it, they'll start using the same offensive language that might be in the book. It all depends on the person's perspective if they find a book offensive or has “bad” content, so don't read it and find something that you wouldn't find offensive. Overall, not all the things we read, watch and listen to @ MONTH1 are bad, even if they contain some offensive elements. For some it can be bad for others, it can be a part of their life. If I had a story to tell and worked on it for a long time. I would like it to be read, seen and heard. Censorship @ MONTH1 is good for some and bad for others. If you are a person who always loves a happy ending, then maybe the censorship is good. But if you want all the story that can be non-fiction or fiction, censorship isn't for you.

If they are offensive, they should be taken off the shelves because small children will not get them. And I think they shouldn't be there and the first place because almost everyone goes to the libraries. If I found the offensive they risked being shut down or whoever ever put them they would be fired. children should not see or know them at all. offensive books, music, movies, magazines are not found most in the books children go to. I think most people would be mad at schools or libraries for having them. And most couples would go talk to the people who did that. But if it happened to me if my kid came home with one of the offending magazines or whatever, I would ask them where you get it and then I would go talk to the poelpe who runs it. And most of the people who make these things would be mad at the kids and it's not their problem that somebody did that. And the first thing they should do is have an @ NUM1 or older on books, movies, magazines, and music if they're in libraries. They shouldn't be where the kids go to read books or anything like that. They should be where people who are @ NUM1 or higher get them, but I still think they shouldn't be and there. But if the offensive is on libraries, people should bring them to justice for offensive books, movies, magazines, and music.

Do you believe that certain documents, such as books, movies, or music, should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive ? I believe him. The reason for this is that there may be a lot of books, movies, or magazines in some places like library or stores which may involve offensive things like violence or other bad stuff. A lot of things can influence the reader if they read an offensive book or if a child sees a movie that involves violence. One of the reasons I think books should be taken off the shelves is if they are deemed offensive, because what if the reader reads the book and finds a word that offends him or her ? Or if they read a book and he talks about bad things? Or maybe a child can read a book and learn bad things. A lot of things can happen while reading a book. And a lot of people sometimes find it really offensive that the book is about their religion, race, or anything related to their personal lives. This is why I think the books should be taken off the shelves, so that people are not offended. Another reason will have to be if a child or minor rents a movie or their parents rent the movie. Then the child will probably want to see the movie and he will not know what the movie is about. The child might see something that is bad or might see a lot of violence. Sometimes parents don't really realize what the kids are watching. It is therefore important for them to learn and supervise their children. In a movie, anyone can see a lot of bad things that can affect anyone or offend anyone. So I think they shouldn't have certain movies on the shelves that may harm or offend some families or some parents, especially kids. Magazines can also be considered offensive to a lot of people. Every time you go to the store, you always see magazines on the shelves or elsewhere. These are either singers, people going through divorce, violence happening around the world, arrests, or there might even be bad footage that everyone could see. Which would be something bad, especially if a small child picked up a magazine that contained something bad. That's why they shouldn't have magazines that have bad stuff in public. Or adults shouldn't buy certain types of magazines because they never know what the child can expect to see. So there are a lot of reasons why I think people should delete certain books, movies, magazines, or anything that involves offensive things. All over the world you will see things that may offend you or someone else just by seeing something in a movie, listening to a song, or even reading a book. It's just not a good idea to have stuff like this in certain places like the library, stores, or anywhere else. Especially if there are people who find it really offensive when they see a book title that is bad or when they hear a song that has a lot of bad words in it. It's just wrong to have stuff like that that can offend a lot of people. What if I read a book and it talks about my race or religion, would I take it offensive ? People should ask themselves this question before reading a book or watching a movie. Thus, they will decide whether or not to remove books, magazines or music from the shelves.

Yes, I think some books, movies, music, etc. should be deleted. They should be placed in a different position for children unable to find them in the area. Because some materials in the listed objects can trigger bad behavior. In order to prevent the items from being found by children, you must place them in a different area. Some where children are unable to reach. like in high areas like the top of the shelf or closet, maybe the attic. For better preservation, place certain items that you think may give children bad ideas in a personal safe. where no one is able to squeeze things out. It is important that certain objects are seen, listened to or watched for the elderly. For example, books can provide pictures for children to do things that are not correct at their current age. Music can talk about things that person has done and make that kid want to do it because they might think it's cool because the artist is doing it. For magazines, they show articles from rappers, actors, and other famous people doing something wrong. set a bad example for the child. Now for the materials they should be hidden in a place where no child would think of looking. Because the materials sometimes harm the child or maybe even put him in the hospital. From experience, I have thought or taken material that I should not have played with and the result has not been good. From this experience, I learned not to think about objects that I know not to disturb. Therefore, it is important to keep certain items out of the reach of children. Because the result may not be what you wanted. serious actions can come from the objects, and later come from the same child who listened to it, saw it or watched it. So make sure the items are out of the hands of children

I think there are some things in libraries that should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive, but not all of them. One of those things is anything that undermines or degrades one's religious beliefs. Another thing could be anything that involves racial stereotypes or overt racial comments. Having anything containing this could trigger conflicts inside or outside the library. Another thing that could be, but not entirely, removed from library material could be books that express violent or criminal acts. This type of material should only be given to older audiences. I think anything that contains slander or judgments about another person's religious beliefs should be removed from library shelves. Over time, people take religion more and more seriously. That being said, I don't think anyone would want to read a book or watch a movie in which the things they believe in are laughed at or rejected. At first glance, @ MONTH1 may not seem like harmful material, but your opinion @ MONTH1 changes when your customers come back angry and frustrated with what they have read and seen. It would be a better choice to avoid this conflict with your customers and keep this material out of your library, unless you want to deal with constant complaints and arguments. Another thing that needs to be removed is racial material. Racism has been one of the biggest problems in the world, it affects us all, no matter who it is against. Imagine a book in your library that deals with all problem black teens or a book that says all Arabs are dangerous, racist, right ? Now imagine if your customers were from one of these two ethnicities, that is not a good image at all. Keeping these harmful stereotypes and sayings off library shelves is a great business choice and will make any customer happy. The last thing we want is for a customer to say ' these people are racist ! ". Finally, I think that books which express violent and criminal acts should be censored with minors. Children always follow what they hear or see. Since they're still at that point where they rarely do things their own way, they @ MONTH1 imitate or copy the things they see. Another problem that surrounds it is the peer pressure which will lead more and more children to commit these acts. If this were to happen, many parents will become outraged and blame the libraries for disseminating this material to children. The best choice would therefore be to keep this material away from minors, if it is contained in your library.

A lot of people I know would be very upset if there were no more books on the shelves in the library. I think there should be books that are offensive, that want to read a boring and not exciting book. Libraries should have labels on the books, so when people go to look at them, there would be a label that says this book @ MONTH1 is unsuitable for people in the setting and contains foul language. This is just one example. There should be sections for adults and children in the library, perhaps sections for all types of books like murder and mystery. This also applies to movies, music and magazines. I like to go to the books in the library, you never know what to expect from a book

Do you think we should have censorship in our libraries? I say no because if we had censorship there would be very few good books, magazines and movies because in this world today everyone is offended by something. For example, in action, horror, and comedy movies there may be blood, violins, and swear words. which sometimes makes a good memory. Even in some books there are cures and violins. Some @ MONTH1 even seem provocative. For example, in @ ORGANIZATION1 the book uses the n word. Even the same magazines like fashion, sports and the same automotive magazine are considered provocative. And if I walked into my local library and saw all my favorite movies, books and magazines not on myself, I would never go back. I'm not trying to say put adult books in the elementary school library. but in the public library it's ok to have a book like that. Could you imagine a library with censorship? He would empty himself.

Today we all have a huge variety of books to choose from when we walk into a library. Some are children's books, while others are intended for a more mature reader. Many parents are worried that their child will read a book that @ MONTH1 is inappropriate for their child. The thing is, if everyone takes away the books that they don't find acceptable, there will be no more books in the library for us to enjoy. What makes a book unacceptable to read? Could it be language, graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary? Many people think that books like these shouldn't be accessible to anyone. Removing a book from a library would be done by notice. It's not fair because we all have the right to freedom of the press, which means anyone can publish whatever they want and everyone has the right to read it. By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the copyright of the author, but also the reader's right. Unfortunately, there are books that @ MONTH1 scare a child. When a child reads a book, it is more difficult for him to realize that he is only reading a book. Many children take every word in a story and make it come true. Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true. As more and more of these books are published, it becomes more and more likely that children will read these offensive stories. I think removing books from a library on the basis of an opinion is wrong. I understand that leaving these types of books for children to read might be a problem, but libraries are usually organized into sections. For example, there is a section for children, a section for adolescents and a section for adults. This helps children stay in an age appropriate zone. I think if a parent is worried enough that their child is reading an offensive book, then they should accompany their child to the library when they are checking which books to read. A public library is designed to support a wide variety of readers. There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive. Removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from ; and if that happened, there would ultimately be no more books for anyone to enjoy.

No, I do not understand. I say there is material for adults, adolescents and children. Children won't want to read adult books and adults won't want to read children's books teenagers won't want to read children's books but they @ MONTH1 want to read adult books and that's OK. They will soon be adults, they @ MONTH1 will be interested. There is nothing wrong with it. If parents don't want teens or kids to read this kind of material, they should go with them to the library and get them approved before they go to the books, magazines, or whatever they want to read at that time. . Movies are the same there is different material for each age group some age groups @ MONTH1 be interested in other age group material and that doesn't mean it's wrong means just that the theater matures more and is interested or couriouse let them explore they will find for the serlfs whether the material suits them or not

OFFENSIVE BOOKS !!! Have you ever thought about the reasons why students read what they are ready to now ? They read books about sex, guns and more because they think it's hot, guess what it's not ! The authors who make these kinds of books want you to buy them because they want their money, but they never think about the kids. Kids would read anything now because of that stuff. I think books like this should be deleted because you don't want your child to grow up reading these type of books, so when they have a child they won't want the same. A lot of parents don't care what their kids read as long as they read, it's good with them, it's not good, it's very bad and I wouldn't expect a great writer uses bad language, so they think it's okay to do it! This is why children act like they do now because of books, movies, etc. I think they should really stop making these books or have their own stores where, like adults, can go and buy these books or whatever book they want. I don't think kids would want to read these type of books anyway because they don't want to learn this stuff, but some of them do and I don't think that's fair. That's why kids should read a great book and not judge a book by its cover! @ NUM1

Censorship in libraries could have negative effects on the library. Parents have different views on books, music, etc. A parent @ MONTH1 has no problem with a book that has a few swear words in it, but another parent might think it's not something they want their kids to learn and read and then start using that kind of. language. But if the libraries censor this book and are taken out of the library, it would have a big impact on people because, and if someone really likes this book but someone complains about it, it is now not allowed in the library. The library would lose people because of the censorship of books. Everyone might not agree on a different topic and would like a certain book, music, movie, or magazine to be censored. But if someone complains and the book is no longer there, that means the libraries are going to be empty for now. A person who @ MONTH1 has no children might say, "@ CAPS1 a little joke can hurt." A joke that is not suitable for a child under @ NUM1 to read, hear or watch. But a parent may be upset that their child hears, reads, or even sees these things and may take them out of the library. When a student @ MONTH1 has to go to the library to research their topic, they have to do some research for the school and cannot find any or even good books on that topic because someone who thought the book was offensive has been removed from the library. The student might be frustrated and not sure what to do and should get the most out of all of their @ CAPS2 research. What if their teacher / professor said they need more than one source and all of their information can't just come from the computer, they also need a book, d 'a magazine or newspaper. But since this topic they are looking for has upset someone, they are not able to find the information they are looking for. Yes, there are books, music, movies, magazines, and sometimes newspapers that are not intended for children under @ NUM1 or even pre-teens to teens. That is why the libraries are divided into sections for age groups. Yet how do these sections prevent our children from reading anything inappropriate. Parents should know when they walk into a library that they should look for signs on the walls. read the inside or outside cover to suggest what kind of books are in the rest of this section. It shouldn't be hard to find these sections because usually the kids section has kids toys and puzzles and themed walls. Censorship would not only wipe out books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but also empty our libraries. Many people have different points of view, his point of view may be different from his. From teens to young adults, from teachers to children, from parents to non-parents. Everyone is different, no one can speak for the whole world. This is why censorship would not work in our libraries.

Many people have huge debates about what they think is appropriate for children and adolescents to read, watch and listen to ; in this topic there will be discussed opinions and logical explanations of what some people think are the good things that children should be exposed to. First, children should not watch movies rated @ CAPS1 or even @ NUM1 if they have vulgar, sexual, violent, etc. content. Even if some parents allow it, these movies and magazines can still have a huge impact on the child and perhaps the way they act in their future. Second, there are still lots of movies for kids to watch and learn that can improve for their education, career, etc. Finally, teens and young adults exposed to these kinds of movies, books, music or any other entertainment-based media are more likely to make destructive decisions than a teenager who does not. Although this is not always the case, it increases the chances of bad decisions and influences young minds. In conclusion, young adults, teens and children should not be able to watch media containing vulgar content, sexual content, veiling, etc. without parental supervision and permission.

In libraries there should be control over certain types of books, magazines or movies that children should be able to read. For example movies, are we going to let a @ NUM1 year watch a movie rated @ CAPS1 let alone watch a porn movie. No, this is simply not true. It goes with magazines and books. Magazines contain images that are not suitable for the correct age group and can easily be grabbed and viewed. Books too, kids have a very imaginative mind, they @ MOIS1 don't have any pictures in them, but kids always know a little more than we give them. I would know because when I was little my brothers got a movie rated @ CAPS1 called '@ CAPS3's @ CAPS4'. After watching all the @ NUM2 movies available at the time, I just couldn't look at a doll the same way anymore. Every time my mom got rid of a doll she owned, some of them had moving eyes. I always sat on one side of the car while the doll was as far away from me as possible. To prevent other kids from going through what I did, local libraries should create sections in the library where you have your kids section, teens section, and adults section. So you can easily tell kids to go only to teen section or kids section. This should also be the way of organizing movies and magazines. I know some people would disagree with my ideas but I have to ask them back. Do you have better ideas? Now to get rid of things in our library that may be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture to be able to survive it. They need to know that there are still racists even though society tries to cover them up. There is no way to prevent the opinions of others from reaching @ CAPS3's ears. If our children are to grow up to maturity, they have to experience or at least know what bullying is. Maybe learn what an atheist is or find out for yourself what a sexist is. Some of these are inappropriate, so I agree that kids have to find out at a certain age, but you can't keep it out of their lives forever. That is why it is better not to throw away the books that mention this stuff.

Censorship in Libraries Have you ever come across something in the library that makes you say: '@ CAPS1! This is inappropriate! ' If so, I am sure you are not alone. The other day I was at the library. There were posters everywhere with a new movie now available for rental. I remember seeing commercials on TV for this particular movie that looked rather repulsive. How could they allow this sort of thing to be exposed like this? How does this affect the minds of young people in our country? My thinking on this topic is clear, although I'm sure I would receive some opposition from others, as everyone has their own opinion on this issue. I know the library has age limits for rental, but what about all those posters all over the place? You don't necessarily have to rent the hardware to be corrupted by it. I think there should be a separate section for this kind of material. @ CAPS2. New music sometimes contains obscene or inappropriate lyrics that have no place in the library. Even the covers of some @ CAPS2 should be removed for the public good. It's interesting how these things slide right next to the library. I once saw a youngster renting a @ CAPS4 that had the words " parental advice " on the cover ! Nobody stopped him. Books are the same way. Eerie covers and titles litter the library. No one even cares about sifting through those books before they hit the shelves. So when do you think someone is going to do something about censorship in libraries? It's hard to say, but I firmly believe it is up to protesters like us to stop this. I hope you will join me in this epic battle for censorship, to protect our young people

Personally, I don't think that books or magazines and the like that have offensive stuff about them shouldn't be deleted because they give people something to read. Most people don't want to read @ CAPS1 or a novel. Some people want to read about the crimes, mysteries, and the action. There are a lot of great movies out there, but some of them that I can agree with are just too offensive to others. I guarantee movies with comedy will be written on what is said. For example : @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 for some people is very offensive. The only reason the person might think the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people who have no life. I may believe that there are literary materials which are offensive to others, but the person who criticizes others does not think they are offensive to people who read the books which have offended the person who is offended. War books for some people are too graphic. But these war books are probably history books. I've only started to notice people trying to get rid of those pounds that they don't like. But back in @ DATE1, people didn't care what was in a library. They just want something to read. I say leave the libraries alone!

Censorship in libraries is a big problem in today's world. Many authors are now using offensive methods and terms to persuade their audience. However, many do not. All authors have the right to say whatever they want, but there is a limit to where the books should be placed and who should see them. If libraries accept magazines, books, music, movies, etc. shocking, they should most definitely be placed out of the reach of children. Like many libraries in the city, there is a section for children and a separate section for adults. Any material found to be offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult only area and customers should be warned in some way. Since everyone has their own vision of what is good and what is not, a special team should be tasked with separating the offending elements. Those who borrow anything from the @ MONTH1 library have the right to bring this special book or film to the attention of managers. By sticking to this method, offensive materials may remain out of the reach of those who do not wish to see them. Articles containing vulgar language are mostly unfair. There is still the majority, however, who engage in the desirability of viewing these materials. Everyone has the right to do whatever they want, but from personal experience and growing up in a home where I learned right from wrong, people should be treated with dignity and respect. No matter our color, size, appearance or personality, we are all created the same, as our constitution says. Therefore, we should only see what would be considered fair for all. After all, everyone wants to be treated kindly, right?

Public libraries should be able to store all kinds of content for all kinds of people. I am very attached to my statement because everyone in this world is different. Many people have different interests, religions and customs. If we took certain books and music out of the library, it would defeat the purpose of calling it the public library. But if we had different sections of books, music, etc., people could more easily find what they want / need, and no one would have to worry about being offended. It would not be fair to anyone in this world if we took away certain books and documents because someone was offended.

People in this common era have different approaches to the idea of libraries. Some see the library as a place to go, learn, express yourself and be free. Others think it is a place where there is a danger to minors and can be very inappropriate. These two opinions can provoke an intriguing argument. People go to the library because they want to either get away from it all or just be free and pick up a good book. There are many books to choose from, but you need to be careful when browsing. some books, while good, may be inappropriate at certain ages, and this is when controversy boils over. Parents think the library encourages the removal of inappropriate books, but that's not so true. It's all about the placement of the books, and that's what most librarians will tell you. They did not encourage the child to take a look, but they have every right to do so. It is also unknown that what is offensive to one person can bring joy to another person perhaps of a different race or ethnicity. I believe that those supposedly offensive books or magazines that parents complain about should not be taken out of libraries. There is a reason why these books are there and they are not posted there to be offensive; so why take them apart? I think one way to monitor these kids so that they stay away from books that their parents think might harm them is to establish a rule that a child must be present with an adult in certain sections. This will not only stop children buying books that are very inappropriate for them, but it could also cause parents to stop complaining and the controversy will end. People need to stop looking at the library as a place that brings negativity, but as a place to give joy to children. Remember that it was designed for those who love to read and therefore people may have a place to read it. Why complain? Find the bright spots in what he brings instead of looking down on it. Bring back the feelings of what the library gave you as a child.

Most books, movies, music, etc. Moderns do a fairly good job of placing warnings in the form of " @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 " sticks on their covers. But the books before this practice started happening @ MONTH1 are found to be more offensive than the books today. Why? Well, that's because a lot of books from the past use words that are now considered offensive. But these books, movies and music are not at fault as parents try to make them believe. There are examples of how each category is in today's society. Take for example the book 'The @ CAPS3 of @ ORGANIZATION1', written by @ PERSON1. In this story there are words that are used to describe the people of that time. Back when @ PERSON1 wrote the book it was perfectly fine to use those words on these people, but in today's modern world this is a book that was on the list to have been banned. It is offensive to use that word for people today, so parent groups and others are trying to take this book off the shelves in the hopes of erasing what has been done in the past. I don't think a book should be banned for its content, but rather for the way it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and culture of that era, then it shouldn't be banned at all. You have to read it. Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are films that just aren't aimed at a younger audience. People have to be of a certain age to rent, buy or watch these kinds of films “legally”. Few people listen to this system, even though it has been around for years. A horror movie is not suitable for a young @ CAPS15 who believes everything he sees on @ CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives @ CAPS15 nightmares or makes them less emotionally aware of what is right and wrong. It's the parents' fault. They were the ones who let their @ CAPS15 watch this movie in the first place. The film should therefore not be held responsible for @ CAPS15. If the film was aimed at a more mature audience, it should stay that way. And that brings us to the music. There is a lot of music in our time that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few “pure” genres free from the curse that is used in many others today. But kids, teens, and adults all find their favorite genre, and you can't change your mind then. The government has stated that any music with harsh words, horrific images in mind, gruesome scenes, and other material that is offensive to people must carry a sticker. The black and white sticker '@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2'. When parents see this sticker on the download @ CAPS7, @ NUM1 or whatever their @ CAPS15 uses, then they know it's probably not fair for their @ CAPS15 to listen. This doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it does mean that there is a small chance that their minds aren't tainted with " trash ". So in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain “ offensive ” material should not be taken off the shelves. Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't necessarily mean it's the same to another. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep kids from seeing them, and to help with the level of harshness that is given to society today. People will always say that books such as " The @ CAPS3 of @ ORGANIZATION1 ", " The @ CAPS3 of @ PERSON2 ", " @ CAPS10 in the @ CAPS11 ", and many more books like them should be banned. They will always object to films such as " A @ CAPS12 on @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14 ", " @ DATE1 on @ NUM2 " or " @ CAPS15 on @ CAPS16 " being taken off store shelves as this has given them nightmares as @ CAPS19 or it gives their @ CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight back and say that artists like @ CAPS17 '@ CAPS18, @ LOCATION1 and @ CAPS19 @ CAPS20 are not suitable for their @ CAPS15. Well, this model has been around for years. These books were made many years ago, these movies are aimed at an adult audience, not a youngster @ CAPS15, and these artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue over what should be on the shelves and what shouldn't, remember that maybe it was that parent's fault for letting their @ CAPS15 see it first. place.

What do you want your kids to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, pictures, and movies that we don't want our younger generation to see. It is @ CAPS1 that parents are so careful with computers and what their children have access to. Each situation has its pros and cons, but in @ CAPS2 cases, if you analyze the pros and cons, you can draw a specific conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run to do whatever they want, usually in the children's section. Let's face it, kids don't want to look at an adult book. Once the kids learn to read, you might have a bigger problem. As kids get older, they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading more difficult books, and watching whatever they want on the computer. I'm sure the first thing that might come to mind is censoring the library, removing horror movies, banned books excetra. It may be good at first, but what about adults who have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does that mean that if our society doesn't like a book, movie, or magazine, adults have to go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie instead of borrowing it for free from the library? public library. It might work, but if a kid is looking at bad things in a library, what will stop them from looking at them in a bookstore ? Another problem concerns prohibited books. @ CAPS2 of them are classics that previous generations have read in school. @ CAPS1 would we decide to retire these books now ? It gives the impression that the younger generations cannot stand it, or that the past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is writing that has stood the test of time. Does it stop here and now? @ CAPS1 would we take the classics? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in future generations, what is preventing them from being forgotten? Some parents of banned books will look and say, " @ CAPS1 would that be banned ?" I don't remember anything bad about it. @ CAPS2 of the time, the classic prohibited books were written for some time in the @ DATE1, @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 or the @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts like a history book to show us what it was like to live back when it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of foul language that people should get out of our schools, but they are missing the essential. It was like that back then so who are we to hide it? Does that mean I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided or placed in a section out of sight of younger children. Horror movies don't need to be taken out completely, just put them in a different section. If parents are worried about monetizing their children on the Internet, there is nothing stopping them from monitoring their children while they are using a computer. I think there can be cession in libraries, but sometimes our society goes too far. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations, we can make our country a safe and educational place to learn.

Have you ever read something that you found offensive, upsetting, or that drove you crazy? Do you think there are any certified books that should not be allowed in a library because of their content ? Nowadays, many books, music, films and magazines contain things that hurt society or convey bad images of certain social groups. In @ DATE1's company there are many different groups of people and many of them have their own opinions on how they view different things. For me, when I think of a library, I think of how all the people of different ages go there, how there are many different groups of people there, and what types of books are there. are there. Taking all this into consideration, I think everything should be allowed in public libraries, but I think there should be separate places for books, magazines, and movies that should be for adults only. I think this is because if you take out all the things that are " bad " or " offensive " to you, you might displease those who find these things interesting or who like to read them. In this case, people would no longer come to the library because they cannot read what they like to read or find interesting. In saying these things, segregating the books into age groups is a good thing, as the younger kids running around the library won't pick up something they shouldn't be looking at. I also think it would benefit them because if someone walks into the library looking for a book but doesn't really know what to do and goes into their age group ; then they can see whatever is recommended for them. From my own experience, I know that I have read books and watched magazines that I probably shouldn't have looked at because I was too young. That doesn't mean they have to take them off the shelves but maybe they should be put somewhere someone my age can't find them. So the next time you go to the library and see something that offends you, just remember that there are a lot of different people in this world who might find what you think is offensive, interesting.

Yes, there are a lot of books that contain graphic and sexual phrases, and there are a lot of worried parents who are worried about what libraries might let their children read. A good idea would be to put age limit signs in certain areas of the libraries, this necessarily means that the child will listen to this sign. We all know for a fact that pornography will stay away from libraries and stay where it is right now, so it's not an issue parents should be worried about. I think libraries should be divided into sections. There is a kids section, a teen section and an adult section, but I don't think the adult section should be too far removed from the teen section because when we are talking about adult books or magazines, everyone expects this to be one thing, porn. It should always be a type of book with some sort of censorship. There should be doors blocking each entrance to each section of books, and to access them you must show the librarian proof of age to be able to enter those sections except the children's section. The children's section is a section that all children can use because we know that this section of books would be harmless to children. I think that with that kind of security, it would allow parents to be less stressed and worried about the security and insecurity of their child's mind. There are tons of other ideas to explore so that you can try to keep books with some sort of censorship, but most of them are wacky and ridiculous. I think music and movies shouldn't even be in libraries, just leave them to other stores, better let stores take care of it rather than libraries. The librarian probably doesn't even know half of the CDs that are probably ripped anyway. It is therefore preferable that you do not have any at all. Think about these ideas that I just gave you. Personally, I think blocking the doors to access certain books would be a great plan to use, as it would block certain children from accessing those areas. Other parents or people might have their own ideas and it would be great to hear them or have some kind of bullitun about them in the city of the city.

Look, it's a plane, it's a bird, it's a ... harmful word. There have been many times that I have read a passage whether it is a magazine article, a book or a newspaper and I have come across some hurtful words. They @ MONTH1 don't all mean bad things to me, but to other readers they could. People have their own opinions on different points of view, so a word or passage might affect me differently than someone else. I don't think it's the material, I think it's the maturity level of the readers that makes the difference. This is how harmful words are turned into nouns and then the next thing peers call other peers that word. For example, the word "wetback" in the @ CAPS1 biography book, it's good to be there, that's when the reader calls it the wrong way, and they think it's funny and cool to go around and call someone that word, especially someone of that breed. This is when I don't think materials like this should be on the shelves, but then again it comes down to the maturity level. These words or passages can become harmful to someone who has not even read it, but because someone has taken the initiative to start calling someone by that word, or reporting this passage to them. Books can and are a great, reliable source for school kids looking for class projects, I think these are some of the topics in the books that turn these words into evil. Books about certain races can cause abuse in a school just because they read it in a book and think it's good, because the book describes a person that way doesn't mean it's good for the reader to start calling people by that word. Other topics such as " sex " in a book can also be poorly covered. Some teens think it's okay just because the characters in the book do it, so it's okay for them and their partner to try it out. Either way, with the book left on the shelf or taken out, there will always be an issue with name calling. It will therefore take something other than material removed from a shelf to find a solution to this problem.

Censorship is a very important thing to talk about. Some people think a book is too much about sex, while others think it is suitable for the audience. Sometimes people want other people to make decisions about what they read. People have to decide what to do and don't want to read and see. First, people think that other people cannot decide for themselves what to read. They blocked books because they thought it would show kids a side of things they didn't want them to see. The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 books were blocked because they had witchcraft and they were afraid people would start trying to do it. The @ CAPS3 grapes were banded because they were slavery. Even though slavery was an important thing, they still didn't want the younger ones to have it. Second, certain music and films should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express themselves. Lately, they've gotten to the point that drugs and " hos " are good for talking. A song I just saw was called @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7. Now if that doesn't send a bad message, I don't know if it's a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They show the violence that people only have in their heads. @ PERSON1 was a movie that showed off the top of my head a miner who had become completely bloodthirsty and killed whoever entered his cave, just because he could. Although we need to see the things people have on their minds @ CAPS8. I know I'll be more careful when I go out. In conclusion, @ CAPS8 is not a real yes or no. @ CAPS8 is always an exception to everything people say. This is why people have to decide what to do and not watch and read

Where do you come from? What religion are you from? What have you been taught? Almost anything that can be considered offensive. So should we take this stuff out of libraries? No, this stuff is everywhere. You can't get away from it. Today you can find so many offensive TV shows and commercials. For example, the ads for @ CAPS1 gum with this woman @ CAPS2, some people might find that offensive. You might ask " @ CAPS3 ", well, there might be a person with an illness who can't have that " clean feeling " and always has bad breath. This person might be offended by these advertisements. Another example could be TV shows, like @ ORGANIZATION1. Some @ CAPS4 and just other races are offended by this stuff. Does that really mean we should get rid of it? Everywhere people are offended by something, the world is not perfect. Even if we put out this type of offensive material in libraries, it could still be seen. So, what is it for ? If you tried to take it all off, like everywhere in the world, it would be crazy. There is no such thing as a perfect world, I think if there was, people would go crazy. For example, in the movie '@ CAPS5 @ CAPS6', the main character finds a city that is supposed to look like 'The @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8' or a perfect company. In town at first everything is fine, but then everyone is so perfect that they can't take it anymore and leaves. The best thing you can do is let these materials stick around, as there is nothing you can do to make them disappear from everywhere else. Plus, they help kids learn, if you keep them locked up and they don't know anything then how far will they go in life ? So should these things go away or not? What do you think?

Is there a song your parents wouldn't let you listen to when you were a kid? When you sang that song, did they yell at you and punish you because they told you many times before that you weren't allowed to listen to it ? How about a movie you wanted to watch because that was what everyone was talking about, but it was rated @ CAPS1 so you weren't allowed to watch it. That book on that shelf that you accidentally came across while doing a research project. Containing inappropriate language and terms. There are many media and books that parents would not want their children to read. But above all, there is the government which censors things that are happening in the world. Censorship can have good and bad qualities. In my experience, I have noticed that people who know less tend to be happier than those who know more. But if you are able to read and / or watch this censored material, you will see the idea from a certain point of view, and maybe you will agree with the person. Most news is about things that are bad, rarely good news comes. For example, if something happened at @ LOCATION1, where thousands of people were used to test whether lions liked to eat humans, the government would censor the information from people in their country for some reason. If there was a movie that was racist against the folks at @ CAPS2, the government would probably censor it. Things that look bad tend to get censored. I have noticed that people who read censored material feel special because they have read or seen something that was not meant to be known to the rest of the population. There would be a lot more freedom of expression if the censored material was not censored. People also tend to go crazy when they find out that material is being censored because they feel that something is being hidden from them, could be valuable information. While reading, I noticed that companies that practice censorship tend to have angry citizens. But on the other hand, if they believe it is for the good of society, then they accept the fact that it is not good for them. People also want the right to make their own decisions. In a censored civilization, they have no idea what is going on outside their borders and are usually clueless or being lied to by their government. Censorship can have good and bad qualities. People tend to be offended when material is censored, but it's probably for the best for them. Hidden information can be good or bad, but mostly bad, most people want to know the truth rather than the lie. Censorship is just bad in general, people should have the right to make their own decisions about what to read or watch.

I'm somewhat okay with removing books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material that might be offensive to someone as it might be racial or it might relate to something that isn't suitable for children to read. I think it just depends on the topic, maybe something could be offensive to one person and not the other, so people should choose what they read wisely. It wouldn't be fair to remove certain books from library shelves because people are interested in different subjects differently, so let's say a book has something in it that someone doesn't think is appropriate but another person thinks it is. this book is fine, it would not be fair for the other person to take this book off the shelves. But something that I don't agree with in books or magazines that are inappropriate is the pictures and comics, as children shouldn't be allowed to have access to any book, movie, or movie. magazine containing this type of content. But I also think that parents or an adult should first consider the criteria before allowing a child to read or see it. So it depends on what kind of stuff is in the book, movie, or magazine. Basically it depends on the person, if they don't like the criteria in any of these things, they shouldn't be dealing with it.

Do you think there are any materials that should be removed from library books if someone dislikes or disagrees with the topic or plot ? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion of what the book convinces readers? I believe that every person has a choice not to read a book or a magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive. “We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken away on their own. But if I have the right to take this book away from me - this work that I hate - then you also have the exact same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on ourselves for any of us. @ CAPS1 quote from arthur, Katherine Paterson, in my opinion I believe what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on a lot of things, if everyone had the right to take down a book that they didn't like or found offensive to themselves, there wouldn't be a variety of books to choose from. Sometimes I became intrigued by what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. Either they tell me it's a good novel or they tell me it was horrible. Then I read a few pages and thought it was pretty good. So if they had the right to take this book away, I would never have had the chance to read this book. I don't think people should be able to pull books off the shelves just based on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective on books. Everyone should have a wide variety

Have you ever gone to the library and while looking for a book, come across a book about slavery with strong language or teenage years that included alcohol, drugs, and sexual content ? In the library, you can find books for recreation, study, training, and books that are considered offensive to various people. People with children whose parents would be appalled by what their children read to adults find books offensive. Although there are things in the library that are deemed to be offensive, I believe that books, movies, magazines, and music that contain offensive things should stay on the shelves because the internet is no different from offensive things in the library. a library, most people ignore the vulgar and violent in the pages, and there are some fantastic books that some might find offensive. For centuries people have written and imagined songs, movies, and magazines. What was accepted "back then" is now considered inappropriate for viewers and readers. There are a lot of things in a library that, if not careful, could corrupt your children. Children who read about violence, drugs and other no-no's are what teach them evil. Parents and others have expressed concern about library censorship. Difficult enough as it is, parenthood doesn't need the help of books, movies, and music to influence evil on children. Children are the future and they need to be educated in the right way. An old librarian once told me that books must be cherished over the years because eventually they will be replaced by technology and all books, good or bad, will be gone. It is even difficult to imagine how technology is replacing various things in our lives and how it has changed since its popularity began. How does this relate to offensive books? Like almost anything, the Internet can be used for good or for bad. Parents are concerned that their kids read bad books but let their kid surf the internet, which is hard to say how many inappropriate sites he might accidentally or on purpose. Books, music, and other offensive stuff in libraries are minor compared to the Internet. Protecting children from libraries full of adult content should be the least of parents' concerns. Even though they are preoccupied with the minds of their children when they walk into a library, they can filter out what a child is looking at and reading. The internet is the real villain if anything is to be blamed for corrupting minds. Lots of people around the world have different tastes of what they like in a book. Good plot, good dialogue, interesting theme, drama, language, violence, drugs, alcohol, and sex are all ways that people find reading books enjoyable. Their own opinion of what is interesting is what helps them decide which books to read. Reading books is a passion for some and enjoyable books are a must for them. Without offensive books, people would find reading boring and not be as popular as they used to be. I don't know about you, but I like books that aren't boring. Most offensive books aren't boring and the action is what catches my eye and keeps me reading. There are great books that people have enjoyed reading for years and continue to read today. Even though they are offensive, they provide good detail that is necessary for a good book. Tom @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 are famous for writing horrible, violent and horrific books which would be called offensive to others. You have the choice not to read them or to read them. Books that deal with slavery @ MONTH1 are also deemed offensive like the book @ CAPS1. It does a great job of describing how things were in the slave days. Books, music, magazines, and music should not be taken off the shelves as they are essential for everyday people and reading. They are required by some to appreciate a good book.

Hi my name is mason and i am writing about whether we should take books out of ourselves etc. People have different views on different things. Books, books give different form of learning to different people. Personally, I don't learn from books as well as from the Internet or from TV, but books are nice to have every now and then. Everyone likes to sit down and read a good book every now and then. Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxes you in different ways. Some people can learn by listening to music, but I am not one of those people. It makes you get emotional, let's say you're getting ready for a soccer game and want to get excited about it, well, some music can get you excited for that game. When I sit down and watch a movie, I can learn from it because I have the patience to sit and watch it, to learn from it, but it's just me, others have different ways to learn, but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get straight to the point and waste no time telling you things you already know. Magazines are useful because they have short articles that get straight to the point too, and that's what I love about magazines and movies. While there are very few magazines that provide useful information, the ones that help a lot. So, I think music should be taken off the shelves because it doesn't really teach you much, but books, movies, and magazines help you to a point. It is up to others to decide whether music should be taken off the shelves, not just one person, because music can help others in different ways, not just in one way but in many ways as well.

I am a student of @ CAPS1. I wanted to let you know that there have been some great and interesting books that I have read in the school library and in the public library. The only problem is that there have been complaints from my friends and family about the books. Not only that, but I have also seen books that are not suitable for children to read. I just wanted you to know that because I kind of thought releasing books wouldn't be a good idea for them. I think so because without books, fewer people would want to read and not learn. To begin with, I wanted to talk about complaints that friends have made to me. One of them was that in school there weren't any good books to read and they wanted to remove most of them and replace them with the ones they liked. I thought if they did that they would be the only ones going to the library because there is only choice and not everyone. So what I'm trying to say is that if we don't have good books, the students won't go to the library. If they don't get books, they won't do well in school, which will affect school. In addition, the complaints were that a member of my own family saw a young girl looking at an unsuitable book in the public library. So instead of taking these types of books out, they should be placed in a room that is strictly off-limits to children. They should do it because if they were taken out, this book would never be used again. Another reason is also that if they were to be removed, another person might need information on the subject of the book and could not find it because it is not there. That's why I think these types of books should be in a special room instead of being taken out. Finally, as I had mentioned a little earlier, is that books are really important. This is why I am against the removal of books that are not appreciated by others. If a person doesn't like a certain book / magazine, they just have to ask for the book / magazie they want to read. By doing this, the book that is not being used could in fact be used by someone else who is interested in it. So if we keep all of our books, then more students and more people would go and read. In conclusion, people might say that it is better to take out a book than to keep it. Well, the way I see it, they're wrong because keeping them is better. It's better because someday these books can come in handy regardless of their age. If they were inappropriate books as mentioned earlier, they should be put in a good place. If there aren't enough interesting ones, then asking for one is another way to do it. This is why I think taking books off the shelves is wrong and they should do anything to not let the books go to size

There are things in this world that are relative. Censorship is one of them. Relative means that one person has a different opinion than another. Censorship is when a person or organization in a position of authority does not allow people to see things they deem inappropriate. A very important phrase for censorship is " the things they believe in ". @ CAPS1 is inappropriate for one person could be seen as visible to another. It should not be decided by a person or even a group who thinks they know that @ CAPS1 is socially acceptable or politically correct. Censorship in libraries is not a good thing. @ PERSON3 and @ CAPS2 walk into a library, and there is a magazine on the rack that shows a person standing on a record two hundred pound, twenty-four point record, a white-tailed deer with a gun in his hand. @ PERSON3 strongly believes in the need to provide for the needs of his family and the rights given to an individual in the Second Amendment of the @ LOCATION1 constitution. Even if it means killing an animal for its resources. For some, there is pride in harvesting an animal and knowing that they provided that meat. @ PERSON3 will see the magazine as an opportunity. He might learn tips from the magazine or find new equipment that he thinks might be useful. @ CAPS2 on the other hand is a curator. She thinks killing is wrong and inhumane. She goes to the store and buys her meat from the freezer. @ CAPS2 prefers not to know where their meat comes from. She will consider this magazine to be inappropriate. Again, the censorship is relative to who is viewing the material. Does this mean that just because @ CAPS2 thinks the magazine is inappropriate it should be taken off the shelves so that someone like @ PERSON3 cannot read, enjoy, and learn from it ? This choice belongs to @ CAPS2 not to read the magazine, not to the librarian. @ CAPS2 is responsible for its own opinions and choices. She is entitled to it. @ PERSON3 is also allowed. Leave the choice to the reader. In the book section, there are @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2. @ PERSON1 is a science and history fanatic. @ PERSON2 has a preference for religious books which explain the theology behind some of the things the world says and things of their religion. At the end of the row, at the top of the shelf is an evolution-themed book. @ PERSON1 believes this theory and considers the book interesting. @ PERSON2 looks at the book and thinks, "This stuff is not true. Why would anyone waste their time reading it. Does that mean the book should be taken off the shelf because @ PERSON2 won't read it. @ PERSON2 should just walk away. If he chooses not to, it depends on @ PERSON2. Leave that choice to @ PERSON2. In the office there are the librarians. They have their points views and opinions, and are also entitled. but books, music, movies and magazines that are displayed for verification should not be selected because he or she likes it or opposes it, but because someone might look up the information in this material. If given a choice, this material might not be available to the reader who needs it. Censorship is a terrible thing for libraries. It takes away material from people that can be useful. Censorship, like many other things, is relative. @ CAPS1 a person @ MONTH1 deems in appropriate could be considered quite acceptable with another person. Based on the moral values, character, and opinions developed with the progression of life, people have judged @ CAPS1 to be appropriate or unacceptable. This choice of watching this magazine, reading this book, or listening to this song should be left to them, not for them.

Have you ever thought that some of the things we read and bring back from libraries are not intended for young children ? Some materials found in libraries are sometimes not age-appropriate or even offensive to others. Not all books, music, movies, and magazines offend people or approve of certain things, but they also give children the right to learn things or know things that are rated too high and not. should not be learned in a library. Most of the music in today's society is inappropriate due to the content used like sex, drugs, and violence. Last fall, when I visited my school library, I came across a movie that in my opinion was not appropriate for school and should not be seen without parental verification. Everything about sex and drugs gives young adolescents and children the right to do it immediately, even if they have read, heard or seen it in school. when i walk around town and see teenagers doing things that shouldn't be done, the first thing he / she says is "i heard it in a movie". Most public libraries have movies, books, music, etc. on shelves which are inappropriate but which should not be welcome for young children. most librarians are busy and cannot monitor the entire library, but can make sure it is secure and away from minors. Most of the time, a child will read what looks interesting and funny. Today's books that tolerate violence have guns, drugs, and sexual content on the cover, making it hard for a child not to want to read them. In a school library @ PERCENT1 of the time, all books are age appropriate, but in a public library, it is not because the public library is not only for children but also for adults. some books shouldn't be shelves, but noted things should be. In conclusion, libraries should monitor what is checked out, no matter who it is from, and the ID should be requested.

Not all things in the world are strictly black and white. Each person is different, with different ideas. So when some people are certain that a specific word or topic needs to be restricted, there will always be another person to say the exact opposite. Sometimes what is considered " vulgar " can only be presented for educational purposes. Moreover, it has to do with something our country was founded on, namely freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Magazines, music, books, and movies are primarily for entertainment. Everyone who reads or watches something will understand it differently, and this will have varying effect. Let's say there's a @ NUM1 year old girl who just had her first day of high school. During lunch, she slipped and dropped her food tray. Later that day, when she is alone reading her favorite magazine, she reads an article about Embarrassing Stories, where a girl accidentally entered the boys' bathroom. Some parents @ MONTH1 find this inappropriate, but it made the young girl feel better about her situation. It's human to mess everything up and act like a madman ; we are not perfect by nature. So when we see mistakes made in comedies and dramas by any form of media, it is human to realize that we are not the only ones experiencing these events. To censor books and televisions would be to pretend that nothing bad is going on. That's not to say that a novel written about a brutal murder that contains sexual references should be given to a small child, but it shouldn't be taken off the shelf all together. The subject of censorship in schools is also very sensitive, especially among the youngest. As Katherine Paterson pointed out, if every parent had the right to take a book they deemed inappropriate, there would ultimately be nothing left. Many parents are uncomfortable with being taught things like sex education, but on the other hand, there are also parents who appreciate it. They do this not because it saves them time, but because some explicit topics - to some extent - can help someone mature if done in a controlled environment. Years ago, it was not uncommon to see censorship in the media. It could range from saying “ sex ” instead of “ sex ” or it could be something like extreme propaganda. There is a reason our constitution protects freedom of speech. No matter how well someone @ MONTH1 finds a topic, it usually has an informative purpose. Otherwise, it probably wouldn't have been issued. Choosing what is offensive or not is a matter of opinion. As previously stated, no two humans are exactly the same, and neither will their opinions. This therefore means that if one person in a group is allowed to dispose or censor whatever they deem necessary, it must be recognized that some of the remaining people will be dissatisfied. This is usually where people claim the law protects their freedom of speech. Ultimately, the media are largely for entertainment. It offers many shows and articles, with a wide range of topics. It shows that if someone finds something offensive, that doesn't mean they should rip it off the shelves and complain; it just means they have the option to look elsewhere

@ CAPS1 are all perspectives on censorship in our country. This is how our country is, we have different opinions about everything we do. But we have to live with it, @ CAPS1 there are many different perspectives coming from the old, the young, the parents and the children. In the @ CAPS1 libraries there are books, music, etc. that @ MONTH1 are offensive to people. But we all have different opinions so we can never listen to just one student. Or it would start a fight between people who disagree with him. I think the people who go to the library should be mature about what's going on in @ CAPS1, otherwise they shouldn't be in @ CAPS1 looking at whatever they want to read. The library is open to the public and has a lot of knowledge that it shares with us. But if we get rid of all the censorship, it negates people's knowledge. The books they would get rid of would be because of the children. Because parents don't want kids to watch @ NUM1 + material that isn't right for them, so they try to keep it hidden. I think we should keep the censorship because it would prevent people from knowing if we didn't keep it. And we should remind parents that there are some things in the library that are not suitable for the eyes of children and let them be responsible for what their children are looking at.

I don't think a random stranger should have the right to decide which books to allow in a public library. If they have a problem with certain items in certain books, they should report it to the library. The author who wrote this book has freedom of speech and is allowed to write anything he would like to write. If someone doesn't want their children to look at a book, or read that book, then they should just tell their child to stay away, and if they have raised their child correctly, he or she should follow the guidelines. boundaries that parents set. . However, I think there should be a line drawn on it which is too graphic to display in a public library. Some magazines containing graphic material are very educational, like @ ORGANIZATION1. On the other hand, I'm also not saying we should double the shelves of @ CAPS1 magazines. There is a difference between having books that educate children about other cultures and those that educate them about sex and explicit material. It is the job of adults to protect their children from such material. But there is another way they can do it, other than taking the book off the shelf. Even if the book is filled with drugs or nudity, the affected parent cannot just act on their own. The library owner is the adult who decides what types of books or magazines he or she allows in the library, not the patrons. I think if you are offended by a certain book in one library, you should bring it to the attention of the owner, or just go to another library. If the owner refuses to remove the item from the shelf and the material offends you to this point, you can go to court and argue your case before the judge. But you don't have the right to remove a book from a shelf that doesn't belong to you.

When choosing a book, music, movie, and magazines from the library it is always a tough decision because you @ MONTH1 are like me and want to read more than one book at a time. Books that are deemed offensive are more interesting than just boring books. So why would anyone remove books from the shelves because they were offensive ? When kids are choosing books from the library you want to make sure their kids are reading and you @ MONTH1 also want to check if they are educated. You certainly wouldn't want a small child to grab hold of an adult book or a book that is deemed offensive in some way. So have a section for adults and a section for children. When we walk into a library full of books, there is a great variety of books of all kinds. We would reduce the use of going to the library if the books were taken off the shelves because there would be no point in going there. If you can't find a book there, why go to the library? The last reason not to take books off the shelves is that people who can't afford to buy a book from anywhere obviously come to the library to borrow a book. So taking books with them would only limit their learning and not be of great benefit to them. The only reason I would find it acceptable to remove the offensive books and everything else from the shelves is for the sake of the children's good and safety. If libraries are considering removing offensive books from the shelves, they should have a public vote to see what everyone thinks about them. If they decide to take books off the shelves, why not just have an adult section in the library ? Anyone @ NUM1 years or older could be there. So make it easier to find a book and don't take our offending books away completely.

"We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves." Catherine Paterson. Katherine Paterson is an author who, like the quote from her, believes that some books should never reach children's hands. Does everyone believe the same, no. I am one of those rare people who thinks that no one should have the right to take a book away just because they find the book offensive. You are an old-fashioned woman who believes in old-fashioned ideals like no curse or violence. You, as this woman, take a book and read the first page, on that page you see swear words and decide to remove all violent or swear words from the library. The library soon becomes half empty because of a woman and her belifs. Belifs are a wonderful thing outside of reading and can make you what you want to be. Books don't have beliefs in my opinion. This is true for some books but a book where someone runs away from danger or soars into the sky, these are not beliefs, these are dreams and no one can crush offensive or non-offensive dreams. I compare books to dreams simply because they are dreams, the dreams of the authors who wrote them and who wanted to share that dream with the world. Telling a person that they cannot publish their book just because another person finds it shocking is to tell the author that your dream is offensive. If you don't want your child to share this dream book, then don't let your child take the book. You are the parent of the child who takes this book so you can protect him from the offensive danger it conceals just as you protect him from the dangers of strangers in the real world. Authors don't always write for the good of everyone. The authors do not write for a woman, a man, a child, the authors write for those who share a similar dream. If you don't share the same dream as the author, that's fine, nobody is forcing you to share sometimes dark and sometimes amazing dreams. Authors write because they want to write, to express themselves in a way that only words and stories can. Don't avoid a book because something offends you, @ CAPS1 a book is @ CAPS1 someone's dream. In short, you would never crush your child's dreams. If your kid wants to grow up and be a firefighter, you don't tell them it's offensive to people, then they can't. Why would you want to do something to someone else's dream that you have never met. Be a bigger person and allow that person to live there dreaming through a story. No matter the level of offense, you don't have to take the book and read it. the best way not to be distressed by a book that @ MONTH1 distresses you is to never read the book to begin with.

Some items designed to offend people should be taken off shelves everywhere. I am against any material that offends anyone or anything else. The top three reasons I'm against it is because it's wrong to offend others, offending others can lead to personal problems, and offending others or something else will end up tiring. Just write a book or a magazine, or make a movie just to offend someone or something is wrong. People should always treat others as they would like to be treated. For someone, doing negative lyrics about a person or something says something about the person who made that song. Maybe this person has some personal issues. In order for this person to ignore their personal problems, they are making fun of someone else. Offending others can lead to personal problems. How? 'Or' What? If someone talks about you regularly or offends you on a daily basis, people can get depressed. They may begin to believe that they are nothing. I remember an eighth grade girl telling everyone that I was a " garden tool " and would do anything to change. She also did a song, taunting me everyday about my appearance. In fact, she recorded it and distributed it to the school. People heard it, and like the followers, they started to taunt me too. I quickly became depressed. I got so bad I was suicidal. I thought the world would be a better place without me. I had to go see a shrink to get over these thoughts. What others do or say about you can have a bad effect on them. Last but not least, people will eventually get tired of hearing bad things about someone. The victim will be tired of being teased or argued. People would stop listening to this negative garbage. If people stop supporting these degrading things, then the author will have nothing more to write. The singer would have nothing to sing. Their careers will have fallen through because there is no future in offending others. There are many reasons why offensive materials should be removed from shelves in libraries, shops and everywhere else. These negative comments will get nowhere in life. As I brought out in my body, it is just wrong to offend other people, it can lead to personal issues and it will end up getting tired or getting old. Nothing good comes from making people feel bad. So, again, these negative materials should be done away with everywhere.

In my personal opinion, I think books that have stuff you don't want to read or find offensive should stay. It's not as if the person who takes offense should read it. Suppose you are at the library and see a book that you think offends you. You think the book should be taken from the library just because you think it is offensive, but you have to think for others. Just because you think a book is offensive doesn't mean everyone will think so. That's why they have age groups and grade levels that are set up so that a kid who loves picture books doesn't get stuck with a book that has swear words or other adult stuff. Same concept with movies, magazines, music, etc. Take this for example. I was walking around the library when I saw a book called @ CAPS1 the @ ORGANIZATION1, and I thought to myself that it looked like a stupid book and I wouldn't want to read it. I think they should throw this book away. Now let's think about what this rings true. It might be the children's favorite book and when he walks in there the next day he's gone. What about this, let's say you go get your favorite book and find out that someone found it offensive or someone just didn't like it as much as you did, so there it is. 'threw away. It doesn't seem fair. In conclusion, this is what I think about removing offensive books that some people just don't like. I think they should leave it there because we shouldn't delete it based on our personal opinion.

There are good books and there are good books. Some people find different books distressing about what they do. Others are like books that other people don't like. In a way, books are both bad and good. Good, because people start to read better after reading a lot, and bad because a lot of people don't like to read. I think when you go to a library there should be some unfit books for you to read. Kids go to the library, what if they pick up a bad book and develop horrible habits? Children and adults have very different views on what to read. Children want to read fairy tales etc. Adults, on the other hand, enjoy the mysterious stories about murder etc. Yes, libraries can allow people to browse any book they find interesting; But, what if this book was bad for kids to hang around. It's simple if you make sure you don't leave your books lying around anywhere, the kids won't pick up bad habits or find out something they're not supposed to know. Kids are noises, and they'll try to read your books, or see something bad in a magazine. In the library there is the children's section and the adult section. It helps in a way, but your kid can still find that bad book etc. at home. Parents may abstain from it for the safety of children's thoughts, or questions about this certain book, etc. that they found. It's good to just put things away when you're done and keep all the bad books etc. out of your child's reaction. Books are bad and good. You can find the information you need, or something that you really don't want to read or see. Books contain things that we sometimes need to know and that we want to know more about. If your child finds a book deceptive, make sure he hasn't read or looked at it ; and just hide it away from them. Ultimately, the problem will be solved.

Censorship @ CAPS1 you are trying to find the right book, music, movie, magazine, you @ MONTH1 meet some interesting ones. Should libraries ban certain books just because some are arguing over one page? The person has this ability to read this book or not. Banning books has been a huge problem in today's society and needs to be stopped. People should be old enough to pick a book they like and not have to worry, does this library have the book I want. They shouldn't have to think of @ CAPS1 this way when going to a library. @ CAPS1 you are thinking of some of the worst books, who would like to read them anyway. Lots of books that people think are bad just have one terrible word on one page. They don't think they are banning a book that's perfectly good for other people. @ PERSON2's '@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3' was a big fuss whether or not to put the book on the shelves. The book contained the word @ CAPS4, and some people were not happy with this sequence. The book was very well written and contained only a few swear words. If a few bad words prevent a book from being a winner. The book was such a great story and should be read by many people and should not be kept in a boxed storage room. There are many ways to prevent a certain age from getting a certain book. The library could put these certain books in @ CAPS5 own part of the library. Keeping the books in another part of the library might be a more appropriate way rather than banning them altogether. The book will still be censored for being in this section or not, but we will still have these wonderful books that we all love so much. What if there was a great informative book on how to do a certain task and no one knew how to do it. This book contained foul language, if the health and knowledge of the world were to drop due to bad content in a book, it might help us in the near future. Authors have the same rights as we do. They should have a say in how long @ CAPS5's own book is likely to be on the shelves. The government should not have a full say in this round of questions. The community and the author who writes it should have more say than anyone else. @ CAPS1 an author writes a novel which he thinks of the great content he puts in this great work of art which he does not think of, is it appropriate for children to read. The author loves to write and shouldn't have to think about all the concerns that he just shouldn't worry about. There's this book we read this year called '@ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 Are @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8'. This book had language that in my opinion would not suit others in some of the content that was in the novel. Now do I think the novel should be banned from a library? No, because he used the words in a very nonviolent way. @ CAPS1 reading it I felt the content didn't hurt me and neither did any of my classmates. @ PERSON1 was the author of this book and I thought she did a great job writing this piece of literature. So the next time you think about banning a book, think of all the warm hearts you could crush.

In my opinion, everyone should have the right to go to the library and get any book, magazine, movie, and music they want. People go to the library for many reasons: computers, books, etc. Having a public library is also convenient for people who do not have a computer at home. It's a public library, you should be able to go there to find anything you need in terms of books or movies. Everyone has different interests in their books or movies, and I'm sure people go to the library and expect them to have what they're looking for. Some people go to the library and can't find what they're looking for. Then people get mad because they thought the library would have it and not. But yeah, I think there should be any kind of magazine, movie, or book in the library that you need. I mean it's a library, they should have it all. People also have the right to pick up any book or movie they want. It's called freedom, everyone is different and everyone loves different things. There were a few times that I went to our library to find books or movies and they didn't have them. You'd think a library would have a book or movie about potty training toddlers, but it doesn't. I think they should have any kind of book, magazine, movie you want in the library. Yes some people @ MOIS1 do take offense but who cares obviously they don't want it so let it go get what you want. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean that other people don't like it. So no, I don't think that because some people don't like them they should be taken off the shelves. So no, I absolutely don't think that books, movies, magazines should be taken off the shelves. You are who you are and you love what you love no matter what others think about it as long as it is what you love. So in my opinion the library should be useful for everyone and leave books, magazines etc. on the shelves for people who like to read or watch them.

I believe there are some materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive. People like books with offensive language or content, people like to feel the energy or tone of the writer. Personally, I love offensive language, if everything was censored I would feel like everything is dull and wrong. 'Your @ CAPS1 ****** is cheating on me @ CAPS2 ****', @ CAPS3 you feel the wonder in the body. Now watch if I censor " Your cheating on me @ PERSON1 " it was boring and if you were cheated before you probably thought of ten different things you would have said differently and uncensored. If you are a parent who doesn't want their child to read or see this, you should try teaching or keeping your child away. Instead of deleting them, why not just move them to an @ NUM1 + section of the library. The @ NUM1 + section will warn kids and parents what they're getting into if their parents don't want them exposed to reality, that means they shouldn't be in this area. libraries are usually divided into sections, but if not, if you ask local libraries if they divide adult and children's books into library sections, they should tell you.

Censorship in @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, which is offensive to some @ MONTH1 is not to others. So how do we know, by expressing ourselves artistically, that we have gone too far? We don't and that's why censorship is such a controversial topic. In the music industry recently, there have been messages in songs and music videos that are not best suited for teenagers. Being a teenager is a time of constant upheaval in life, you have to make decisions that will define you as a person. When songs are about drug use and other crimes, teens see them as cool things and follow them because they see them as everyday activities that can't hurt but they don't know what to do with them. 'they're wasting their lives doing this, so I agree with the censorship in that sort of thing. In literature and art, things take on a more serious tone than in music and other media. With literature, it's about conveying thoughts and feelings about a story or another topic. In art, you express yourself visually on canvas or abstractly through other materials and shapes, but both ways you express your feelings and emotions. So censoring these would in turn censor a voice and emotions. When you suppress a man's voice and emotions, you end up with an empty shell of a person who will never fully experience life. As time has changed I have found that people have changed as well. When @ PERSON1 uses the '@ CAPS3-word' in some of his literary works, it didn't offend people back then, but now times have changed. Now, it's not normal that @ PERSON1 used that word, but on the other hand, rappers and the like can say it with all the other words in their music. so how do you know what is offensive and what is not? well, it's all from the point of view of the reader, the listener, or the beholder. Parents these days try to protect their children from the outside world and make it seem like they are just rainbows and butterflies by censoring things children might read, hear or see. in their everyday life. It does not solve the problems in the world, there will always be war, crime and death, no matter how hard we try to stop it as long as there is " good " there will always be. " Bad ". All loyalties aside, in my honest opinion, I think the censorship in @ CAPS1 is a bad idea and will never work to solve real problems with the world. It will cover them up just like the dialogue or the picture that they so want to go away.

While this is a new era of high demand for eBooks, hardback and paper books aren't quite obsolete just yet. Many people still love the old tradition of going to libraries and starting the quest for the perfect book. Plus, with a declining economy, this is the cheapest solution. But the big question is: can people find everything they want in their local library? For some people, this may not be the case due to library censorship. Yes, it is true that many libraries now censor a lot of things that they would think are inappropriate for the eyes of children. I agree that there are some things that should not be displayed on library shelves. Although some adults or adolescents desire more mature acts, these things should not be accessible to children. Children and their parents are among the library's most loyal patrons. Parents don't want their children exposed to explicit materials at such a young age. In addition, if libraries lose young families as clients, almost half of their clientele would be lost. So the next time you want to buy something that maybe ripen for the kids, you might want to reconsider going to the library. Instead, go to a bookstore and buy whatever you need there. Keep children in a safe and innocent environment

Do I think there are any documents, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive ? No, just because a book, song, magazine article, or movie is offensive doesn't mean we should have the right to take it off the shelves. Of course, we have the right to take this book down, but there are a lot of things that are going to offend people. Just because someone stumbles upon a shocking book in the library doesn't mean they would have to do so much work to get it off the shelf. It's not worth it for a single book that you could just look beyond and look at other books. If it was possible for anyone to just take a book off a shelf because they thought it was offensive, we would have a lot of empty bookstores. Because over there, people can and will be easily offended if something they believe, like religion, is ridiculed in a book they have read. We're all offended, but we just have to move on and find something different. We don't have to read this book, listen to this song, or watch the magazine. We have a choice, and the choice may be to move on and read or watch something different, more positive, or go through the process of taking it off and off the shelves. You never know that someone else might think this article in this magazine was perhaps beneficial or relevant. So it shouldn't be up to one person, but if an entire community has a problem with a book, I can see that deleting it may be an option.

I think some books in the library might offend some people. But some of these books have meaning behind it. I think there is one book that a lot of people like to read, and it's @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. The book uses the word '@ CAPS3' a lot and many people find it offensive, but why? There was a big argument that a lot of the book companies changed the word in the book to @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5. From my perspective, I think it should stay the same. Why change that now? Many English teachers use this book because it is about a white boy named @ CAPS6 saving @ PERSON1. It's not used at all in a bad why just using the terms the way they did in the olden days. The book is strong and shows readers a strong side of life. Yes, you shouldn't say that word, but also change it now, after it's been out to the public for a long time. The book wouldn't have the same meaning as if it were edited

Katherine Paterson has written about the real impact of censoring what is put in a library. In the quote, she mentions that if what each person finds offensive is deleted, ultimately nothing is left. The question " Should the contents of the library be censored ?" " Is a widely debated issue. There is a simple answer to this question. It should not be censored. Opinions about what should be censored, and why, vary depending on the type of person and their background. As Katherine Paterson said, “ We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you have the exact same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. @ PERSON2 pointed out that most people wouldn't think far enough to understand. The most logical thing is not to censor works placed in the library. As previously stated, once each person draws what they feel shouldn't be on shelves, the library will be just a building with no books. To prevent children from entering certain types of literature, films and music, libraries could have an adults-only section for these works. Many public libraries don't even have these types of items that would be so heavily contested for the simple fact that if the library doesn't even carry them, they don't have to worry about the issues. These public institutions are working for the best of visitors, and if there are any works that need to be kept from the children's section, there is no doubt that it will be taken care of in an appropriate manner. The subject of censorship is a very delicate subject to begin with. This returns to the debate on what exactly should be censored. The problem with what is "explicit" is that there is no black and white line. Does a book become inappropriate because a teenage girl gets pregnant over the pages ? In some eyes the fact that a teenager has imbibed a book makes it inappropriate, but critics will say that is life and protecting the world from reality blinds us all. Proper instillation of morals and values on the home front will help young citizens make smart choices, but expecting the world to censor itself for every individual is something that would never be possible. Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, but as Katherine Paterson said, if every person in the world deleted what they deemed inappropriate, there would be no more books. With this truth declared, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone. As the world turns, life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist. One can only learn that yes these @ MONTH1 things exist, but using better judgment the whole world can get along just fine without trying to remove anything "bad".

Do you agree with me that we should be aloud to read, listen or see what we want? I think it's unfair that schools have the right to tell us what we can watch, it's ours, it's America and we have the right to do whatever we want. I think we should have a choice to read it and if it's offensive don't read it because it might offend you but not everyone thinks it's volgare or rude and obsessive. I ask you in the newspaper to support me and fight the school and tell them what they should read aloud because it is not fair to censor good material just because crazy work does not don't like it. That's all I'm asking for is that you stand up and support me in this war on censorship.

I don't think any book should be taken away. I think if an adult or a child wants to watch something or read something, they should have the right. If someone were to go to a public library that allows people to listen to music and they can't because the song contains profanity, they should be allowed to do so. And if it bothers someone, the disturbed person can leave. If someone wants to watch a magazine and they can't because it's inappropriate, that doesn't matter. What if people wanted to watch a movie in a library and they can't because it's too violent, then the library doesn't have it. I think libraries should be able to have the inventory they want. And if it's too violent or the music is too dirty, don't let the kids get hold of it.

If I found a book that I thought would be inappropriate for others, I would ask the librarian to check to see what she thinks about the book (s). If she believed they were offensive, then she could remove the book (s) without any questions being asked. If she was in the middle of a book and didn't know whether to remove it, she could vote or count on that book and then go from there to see if it should be removed. The only way I can find an offensive book is if it contains pictures that are not appropriate for people to view and that also depends on your age. Another offensive object would be too many words involving foul language and / or racism. If I found a movie to be offensive, I would just ask that it be moved to a place that only mature adults should watch or certain teens. My opinion cannot remove an item from its place unless there have been several complaints about the book or movie and ect. Some movies and books should be taken off the shelves because young kids grab those movies and watch them and then go out into the real world and do these bad deeds that were on the movie. For example, if the movie / book was about drugs then some kids would think it was okay for them to do it because they saw it on TV. Some kids even get killed for going out and trying out those silly ideas they got from the book and / or movie. But parents also play a role in letting their child watch them, I think if they watched what their kids are doing then part of that is not going to happen. Music is another great thing that gets more and more out of control with offensive subjects. There is more foul language in the music as it progresses. @ NUM1 years old, it wasn't that bad, but it's getting worse. I think some music should be banned because of the violence and the sexual content it describes in the music. Some of the music that I listen to, I just want to run over it with my vehicle because the whole song was about drugs, sexual content and / or violence. I don't even know why an artist would want to write a song on bad content because he knows the younger ones will hear it. I think offensive music has an effect on the violence that actually occurs in society today because there might be racism. I'm not trying to blame the artists or say it's their fault, but I think they should think twice about their songs before releasing them so that everyone can listen to them. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there are things that shouldn't be on the shelves for our kids and kids to listen to and / or watch. I think there will be something done, but it will take time

“We can all think of a book that we hope none of our children or other children have taken off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this job that I hate - then you have the exact same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelves for any of us, ”says Katherine Paterson. Books and films around the world are censored and taken from libraries day in and day out for their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines are not to be taken off the shelves and that they are there for a real purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored as a human being should have their own judgment, parents of children have the right to exclude material from the child's life, and some material may be useful in and someone's life. a @ MONTH1 learns from @ CAPS3. Children everywhere are influenced by books, magazines, movies and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials affect the way children behave and act. However, I believe that a child should have superb morals and values to distinguish right from wrong. For example, if a child sees a porn magazine linger on a shelf at their local grocery store, they should know that no matter how temporary @ CAPS3 @ MONTH1 is, buying that porn magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents constantly teach their children what is right and what is not. They try to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol and tobacco spoil their health. @ CAPS3 does not matter if a child sees someone using drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They shouldn't be swayed by this because by using their logic they should infer that what is read or listened to is not always the right thing to do. Every day, parents of children have the right to exclude harmful content from a child's life. After all, they are a top figure in the child's life, and the child will always admire them for leading the way. In most local theaters, you must be seventeen to see a movie rated “ @ CAPS1 ”. Many cinemas allow a child to watch a movie rated "@ CAPS1", regardless of age, provided that a parent or guardian is present. Theaters feel that having a parent of a child would help tremendously because the parent chooses their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child watching the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to watch a hot movie, they can just say " NO !" » @ CAPS3 is that simple. If a parent thinks a movie is decent for a kid to watch, then go ahead and let them watch this material. Parental consent should always be a primary factor in determining whether or not a child can watch a particular movie or read a certain provocative book. If all offensive books and movies were taken off the shelves, we would live in a structured world where no one would learn more than they already knew. @ MONTH1 life can get pretty boring. Although some @ MONTH1 people find the books and songs offensive, others @ MONTH1 contribute from these materials. A child @ MONTH1 picks up a book, starts reading, and discovers disturbing thoughts he would never have encountered beyond that book. They would never have learned such things. Reading information like this creates an advanced social movement. Adults and children are getting smarter every day. Any parent will agree that they would like any opportunity to present themselves for their children to become smarter and wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books and magazines could provide this for their child. Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkeys for some children. They @ MONTH1 use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost in its animated pages. If more and more books are censored and thrown away, that equates to fewer books a child might have the opportunity to find. I read once that even @ CAPS4 classes around the world do not allow their students to read @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7's @ CAPS5. Teachers find this book too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair to any student because this novel is inspiring and life changing so they are definitely missing something. Also, movies and songs are provided for entertainment purposes only, so @ CAPS3 shouldn't always matter if it's raw. A child or young adult @ MONTH1 learns things they never thought they could imagine from the public materials provided. In conclusion, books, magazines, movies and music are an individual way of expressing yourself. They should not be censored because a human being should have their own judgment, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, no matter how crude @ CAPS3 @ MONTH1, can be used as a learning tool. If more and more material is removed from our local libraries, @ CAPS3 almost looks like authors are being punished for being unique. Our children will not be as exposed, therefore, they will not learn and grow from @ CAPS3. Do you really want our company to ban intellectual thinking just because they think some @ MONTH1 content is offensive ? Think of @ CAPS3

I believe blasphemy has a good and a bad side. The good part is the profanity is that it gives taste and texture to books, music and movies, it shows how a person feels most of the time, it is anger. Blasphemy can also change a person's behavior, the way people talk and act. Personally, I think profanity is a good thing and a bad thing. I like it in music and movies, but I hate it when people talk about garbage. I think they should take it off the shelves depending on the age of the person, for example three and thirteen year old books should not have profanity, but fourteen and over books can. The reason people should take it off the shelves is because children should lead healthy, blasphemy-free lives. They should have a good development of learning skills. Books and other content should have no profanity because children at a young age learn easily and if they accept the bad deeds of others, they themselves will be bad. The reason people should be aware of this problem is if you don't like profanity, then don't buy it. Also keep out of the reach of children. The main reason people swear is that movies and songs drastically change a person. Speaking with profanity in your mouth can change your life, but not having a good job going to jail raising bad kids who learn from parents' mistakes. In profanity @ CAPS1 is good for movies, it gives it action and drama. profanity are mostly negative words expressing anger and rudeness. We have a @ CAPS2 full of profanity, it's like a disease on a grand scale. Pass from people to children to their children. I experienced this the hard way because I am Chinese and came back to USA in @ DATE1, I did not know English. People swear at me all the time and all of this could be avoided if we had no profanity in our daily use of books, music and movies. I have learned a lot about people by the way they talk so I know who to stay away with. We should keep blasphemy but limit it to children. Profanity is like the ice cream that people want and others don't. People could choose there to put themselves in a life without blasphemy. people can do what they think is the right thing to do. I think taking it off the shelves for kids is the right thing to do, but not for adults. Because of profanity, people tend to get in trouble. For example, some people in use get pulled over by an officer for a low cost speeding ticket, but would then swear at the officer putting themselves in greater danger. All of this could be avoided if he had never said anything. Profanity could make a good motivational speech as well, I know that because I'm on the @ LOCATION1 football team. Before each match, our coach motivated us by giving us a speech to inflate us with blasphemy. So in the end what I'm saying is porfanity should say it, but keep it out of the reach of kids for books parents don't buy if you don't want your kids to see them. . Movies read the label on the back of @ CAPS3 and see the agae limit and profanity. Lock @ ORGANIZATION1 shows that contain profanity so your kids can't see them. If you don't want any blasphemy part, you can walk away from it. We all know there is nothing you can do about others who use profanity, but don't use it yourself and keep clean, do what you think is right.

All materials in a library are intended for the public. That's why we have public libraries. Children are most likely accompanied by an adult when they go to the library and are normally looking for books or activities that they would enjoy at their age. If a client in a library finds a book or article that they find offensive, it probably isn't an accident. Materials in libraries are for the public and should not be taken away just because some find them offensive. Children are very suspicious in libraries because they know that adult material is also in the library. This is where an adult comes in and watches the child. Some parents are not worried that children will see these pictures or read inappropriate information, but on the other hand, some parents do. If someone comes across information that would be offensive, they've probably been looking for it and know where it is. Everyone in a library has the right to take or read what they want. There is no sign outside the door that indicates that only certain ages can visit certain areas of the store. It is the decision of parents or caregivers whether or not to allow their child to visit the most inappropriate areas of the store. Everyone has different rules and those rules must be followed, but it is not the job of libraries to track and supervise these children to make sure they stay in their designated area. There is a place for everything in a library and most places are pretty obvious as to what kind of information is there. For example, more adult and inappropriate material can be found at the back of the store. The adult material is retained there to make it more private and more difficult to discover for the small children and to be a little more private for the people who read it. Children's books and films are usually placed in the front of the store, which attracts their attention more. Kids @ MONTH1 never know what else is in the store if they don't go and get it. Children should be accompanied by an adult if the adult thinks their child is wandering off in search of inappropriate material. Other material that might be offensive might not only be for children, but also for different races or cultures. Also, if a person finds this information, most likely they were looking for it. Everything is tagged in a library and something doesn't pop up out of nowhere if you don't look for it. The overall material in a store is public and for everyone who enters the store. Children should be supervised if they are suspicious and walk around the library. If someone does not want to find this information or thinks it would be offensive, then they should not approach the area where it is located.

In our society, many people and places take offense at certain things. In my opinion, libraries and bookstores shouldn't take things off their shelves because they might be offensive. People have the right to pick something up, look at it, and decide whether it's offensive or not. If a book or movie that someone wrote or directed could hurt them enough to panic and complain to the places that sell it, then that book or movie probably shouldn't have been made. I agree, something is offensive, but if someone you don't know wrote or directed it, then don't let them bother you. I believe that music is a way for people to express themselves. Honestly, I don't think music should be censored when sold in a store. If the material is intended for children or certain people, do not listen to it. If you need things to be censored because of words or topics just so you can read, listen or watch them, then maybe you should.                 

<START>

 

When it comes to my idea of having censorship in libraries all over the world, I think there are cases where there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., which should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books etc. that kids might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of all ages might find offensive as well. During my school years, I have come across many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., which I think should never even end up on library shelves. For example, I was looking in the library one day for a book that I could do my book report on, and just reading the spine of the book, I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things. . that I thought it would be inappropriate for someone my age to read. For librarians and other school workers involved in buying books, I'm sure they never even think twice that a book given to young children and teens would be inappropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases , every book has something that would prove them wrong. I also encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was considered a wonderful book, even for someone under the age of twelve. From my own experience reading the book, I have to say that these people are crazy and should re-evaluate the specific age at which they are selling themselves. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive, but also many magazines, movies, and music. There isn't usually a lot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries, but in some cases there is. For example, I met someone who was doing a report on pop culture and while researching music and listening to music provided by the library, they found it very offensive and inappropriate for himself. Other than that, I have found movies and magazines to be just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive. I myself would think teens over @ NUM1 would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teens and even children who read offensive books end up engaging in behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of. When the time comes for my children to reach this age, I hope they will never act like some of the children I have seen or spoken to. After realizing how much inappropriate / offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I recommend that they not only evaluate the type of books and other resources offered in the libraries, but I also realized that I really hope they will take care of this matter right away. Not only do I think parents all over the world would feel the same way as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read any books I have read or offered by my high school library. This is a very serious question that all teachers and parents should understand when recommending books to children and even teenagers. The world is getting more and more violent every day, and it's up to future children to solve this problem. In a situation like this, we don't want the minds of young people to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior. May this be a step in the right direction

I believe that everyone has their right to their own opinion. If a parent doesn't think their child should do something, don't let them. It kind of reminds me of how people are against the hunt if you don't like it don't. If everyone expressed their own opinion, the world would be a much better place. If I don't like @ PERSON1 and tell @ PERSON1 that I don't like him @ PERSON1 knows I don't like him so he won't talk to me anymore. So in a larger picture, if @ LOCATION1 tells @ LOCATION2 that we don't like them, they won't try to make friends with us anymore. so if everyone spoke in their mind, the world would be a lot better. If a parent doesn't like something like a type of music, a movie, or even a book and express it to their child, they'll learn that thing is bad. My dad told me it's okay to kill animals only if I'm willing to eat them, that's fine with me, but other people might not think it's fair. So I believe if you are not a hipocrite and live like you teach your kids that your kids will listen to you. Like I said before, my dad told me it was okay to kill animals if I wanted to or if I ate them. I find an exception to this rule cyotes (we have a lot of cyotes where I live and they can be harmful). I believe this is pretty much the only exception to the rule as cyotes are problem animals in this area. So if you don't want your kids to watch movies rated @ CAPS1 then block them on TV. It's the same with other things like magazines, books, and music.

Censorship in libraries is a big argument today. Many people wonder what is considered " appropriate " for our children. With several @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS2 factors these days, it's hard to find something that doesn't offend your culture. The top three reasons why we are unable to find a reasonable, but not shocking, book for our children in libraries include the beliefs @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2, and @ CAPS3. @ CAPS1 was a big deal at the end of @ NUM1 at the start of @ DATE1. Thanks to @ LOCATION2, slavery has become illegal in @ LOCATION1. However, there are still many racist comments, articles and films published today. If someone doesn't stop harsh comments then @ MONTH1 never stops. While it's not that bad today, that doesn't mean it won't continue to happen. Children do not need to see or hear racist comments about their race like many of their ancestors did. The harsh criticisms and comments of @ CAPS2's beliefs are also inappropriate for society, let alone for children to read. Books containing this are not considered suitable for children and should be placed in a different section of the library. As a teenage reader my greatest conviction and interest is to learn about other cultures to see what it would be like to live in another country. There are countless religions in the world today, many of which are used by their own god (s). I believe it is a great cause for children of the modern world to celebrate their own religion however they like. However, I believe it is not fair to make hateful opinions towards other religions. It is also something that children still have the ability to read. Children should not read fictional facts about religions and think in their heads when they assume that something is true about that religion when it is not. It is certainly a great idea to paste these materials in the @ NUM2 section. For now, children should be given material that they can easily understand and find interesting. It would be a great idea to create an appropriate fiction section for children and then an @ NUM2 section for children and / or adults. One idea to consider is that each local public library could have a meeting to decide whether to keep the library in an easy-to-access form or not. It's up to you to decide !

Each person has their own beliefs and disbeliefs when it comes to books, music, or anything in life for that matter. Let @ MONTH1 be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion @ MONTH1 not be bad in other opinionated opinions. Everyone will have their own opinion about a book, music, movies or magazines. This is why censorship is good in a public place like a library. Does this mean that we are saying that you cannot like what you want to like, listen to what you want to listen to or watch what you want to watch at home? No, by censoring all of this in public places like libraries or video stores you are helping tackle many issues and concerns that might arise in the future. Then again, censoring movies, music, books, and magazines in a library could also be a bad thing. Not everyone will like the same things or be interested in the same movies or books. At the same time, we can't censor anything that someone doesn't like. By removing something because a parent complains that their child is watching or reading a book that they deem too "vulgar", you are giving that right to any parent who complains that their child is doing so. It is not the responsibility of libraries to look after everyone's children, to make sure that they watch and read what their parents want them to do. Children will be children and they will do whatever they want to do. By censoring and removing things from library shelves, you're not preventing them from watching a movie they shouldn't be seeing, or reading a book they aren't supposed to be reading. Censoring libraries is like censoring words in movies, it does not prevent your child from hearing or learning vulgar language. Children today hear more vulgar words in school than in movies and on television. What does the word offensive really mean to a person? Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Like I said, everyone has their own opinions and perspectives on life and all that is in it. You can't take everything off the shelves because a parent thinks it's not fair for their child or other children to see, watch, or listen. We all have the freedom to watch what we want and listen to the kind of music we want to listen to. By removing things from the shelves that other people might like to oppose to others, you are immediately taking them as citizen @ CAPS1. Censorship on things like sex scenes in movies or maybe foul language in music is okay in my opinion. Take books off a shelf because you don't like the way they are written or you don't like the person who wrote them, or you don't like the kind of language the author has decided on to use is not right for me, you are pushing the limits of that one. Books teach children everyday things, books give children imagination. By taking books off the shelves, I think you are interfering with a child's ability to grow. Censorship is a good thing and a bad thing. It could hurt children or help their ability to grow taller. Censoring some things is a good thing, but like I said, anything that is in vulgar language should not be censored, or vulgar scenes. Sometimes, in order to grow up and live in this world, children need to read and see the things that we, as people, but in books and movies.

It goes in the direction of a personal thought. Some people may be happy with things, while others may disagree. Unless it is racist or sexist, no one has the right to say that something cannot belong. If someone doesn't like a book rather than walk away from it, don't wonder why it's there, someone else @ MOIS1 wants it. So I don't like this topic personally, but I agree to write about it. It's not a choice, just as it shouldn't even be a choice for people to say what belongs to where, unless it is rightfully held by the individual. I know there are a lot of things that I don't like, but I'm not trying to shake things up and ban them. This is where people want to read it. Also, the person who wrote or made the item would be shot (@ CAPS1 of sadness or rejection). In the sense of insulting a race and / or being sexist, if it's done in the book, it should be stopped and eliminated. People have a right to say that they are not happy with this, but if they just don't like the topic but others like it, then they should move on and not do the whole thing. a story. Now if the title @ CAPS2 says what the book is about, then walk away, ignore it. People @ MONTH1 are using it for research or something in the future. Now @ MONTH1 people are egotistical and just want what they need, so they either cause a huge @ CAPS3 or fight over stupid little things. These are the people who always gave them things, which I guess is the reason this topic was brought up. So these are my thoughts and beliefs on the subject of censorship. It doesn't matter where, in school or in a library, it is located there because someone is / was interested in the article. I know these are my thoughts and beliefs, people @ MONTH1 completely think what i wrote stupid, some @ MONTH1 think it is smart. It's just the culture you grew up in and @ CAPS1 in mind you are at the current time and place.

I don't think there is a need to remove offensive material from libraries. Some people @ MONTH1 find these things offensive, but I think others will be greatly offended if they remove these things. Take rap music for example. There are a lot of people who think that the lyrics of these songs are just terrible and offensive. Others think rap music is amazing. I don't think rap is very good at all, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that rap songs shouldn't be played on the radio, and @ CAPS1 shouldn't be sold in stores. The same could be said for those materials in the library. Some @ MONTH1 find them offensive, but others greatly appreciate it. Some people @ MONTH1 are interested in these topics. Just like some people @ MONTH1 are interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be fair for libraries to remove these materials from the library and deny rite-loving people from renting these materials. Another factor is the maturity of the reader. If the person who reads a book or watches movies that @ MONTH1 is offending is watching them for obvious interest, that's okay. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem. It all depends on how mature people are when they walk into a library. Library materials are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else @ MONTH1 finds these documents offensive doesn't mean they should be taken off the shelf. I can see why some parents @ MONTH1 are upset that their children @ MONTH1 see some of the things in the library that @ MONTH1 is not suitable, but all of the libraries I have had had a special space for children's materials. If the parents were concerned that their children would see questionable material, they could bring the child to this area. I don't think those documents which @ MONTH1 seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be grieved by something and it is not good to deprive others of these materials, even if it is offensive to some.

Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Libraries are offered to people for new learning opportunities and for entertainment purposes. Everyone has their likes and dislikes, no two peoples are the same. First of all, when a person visits the library, they should know that the books in it have been selected by the owner of the library. Therefore, it is their responsibility to put books in and out of the library. What the owner of a library will try to do is put a little bit of everything in it. What this claim says is that there are so many different types of writing that people have to dislike something. This is why the owner will add a bit of everything to his library. If someone has a book that seems to match their type of book, but after starting to read it finds it offensive to them, they shouldn't just throw the book all together, but they should bring it back to library and talk to the owner. People have the right to do whatever they want with a book, but if it is a library book, it is technically the property of the library. So if anyone is offended by a book, they should go talk to the owner, let them know their concern, and try to do something about it. In truth, they will not be the only ones with this opinion. It takes someone to make a difference. Books are not made for one person, they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy. People have their opinions and stick with them. This is expected to happen with books, they are all different just like people. The society everyone lives in is full of people with diverse opinions who are not afraid to express them. There is nothing wrong with expressing them either, in fact, it is better that way only because others can hear about a book and agree with that opinion or disagree, thus finding out what type of writing they really like. Yes books can be thrown away as of right, but the moment everyone starts doing it is the moment when everyone can't get their opinion out any more. Broadcasting an opinion is letting the world know if someone is on a specific topic. Without it, the world would be just boring to have nothing to say because people would all share the same opinion. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed for several reasons. ~~ @ PERSON1

Need help with censorship in @ ORGANIZATION1 (I changed the @ ORGANIZATION2 of this story I heard from my grandparents because I couldn't remember the real one. It doesn't really happen at @ ORGANIZATION1 I think.) To the folks at @ ORGANIZATION1 ORGANIZATION3 I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with @ ORGANIZATION2. Nothing too serious I guess. . It seems that booksellers are censoring tons of books and other material. One of them that I really need for an assignment on the @ CAPS1 movie. They say they are censoring what I need for the mission because it's too bloody and scary for some of the other readers. There have also been complaints from parents, saying their children have had nightmares for weeks after the film. To that, I said correctly, can I still use the computers out there to get information. They said they had already blocked all inappropriate sites. I don't have internet at home so you can see how it will be in school. So I tried to get @ CAPS2 to decensify everything they've already censored. That way I could just get them to censor all the weird things that adults rated at @ ORGANIZATION2. This way, no child will have more nightmares. I also started the idea of segregating all @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS4 by age group, such as children, teens and older teens. To that they said okay but they were going to keep the classic @ CAPS4 and @ CAPS3 The @ CAPS2 said they @ MONTH1 try my idea and see if it works which has been censored over the years. To that I said okay, but after seeing the house in a big way, the censor list was like a nightmare on at least a hundred book pages. I was too scared to see how long the other lists were. So, seeing that it was too big for me to take care of on my own, I asked most of the other volunteers to help me. Then put up posters at the school I attend to see if someone else is willing to help me. So far there hasn't been a lot of progress in the listings, so I would like to ask if there are any readers reading this article. I could definitely use your help as these are very long lists. I @ CAPS8 all of you for reading this article, if you are not able to help see if there is anyone else you know who would also be willing, @ CAPS8 You.

I think if there are books, music, magazines, etc. shockingly, they should be put in a section of their own, or librarians should keep them up to date and if anyone needs / wants them, they should go to the foreground in order to get them. I also think that if a young child or teen cannot see, read or hear this stuff then they shouldn't be there.

Have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was inappropriate? Did you want to ban the book from the library where you got it ? Well, a lot of people have been through this and a lot of them wanted to have more sensitivity in libraries, but we can't always do that. Maybe that book you just let go, deeming inappropriate for everyone to read, is someone else's favorite book. You @ MONTH1 never know, but maybe someone might think your favorite book isn't appropriate. There are a lot of different people in the world and they all have different opinions. So instead of banning them, how about libraries and schools detecting them. Censorship seems to go without saying, but a lot of people don't think about it. We can't just turn a blind eye to all the inappropriate books, but we can at least censor them. Censoring them can be as easy as putting a label on them or creating a different section for these kinds of books. The labels should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book. People don't have to get rid of some books altogether, but they do have to recognize that young children might pick it up and start reading it without knowing it isn't really for them. Parents have the right to check and monitor what their child reads. Although if you get rid of the book completely, people get rid of other people's free speech as well. No one has the right to determine which books are not suitable and which books are, so no one should have the right to simply remove certain books from the shelves. Instead of banning books or complaining about them, people could try a rating system for books. When buying movies, people often check the rating of the movie to see if it would be suitable for their child or even for themselves. This is what we could do with the books too and maybe there won't be as many problems with the books. It sounds simple enough, but people need to take action and start doing something about it. You @ MONTH1 can't make everyone happy, but at least people can be better informed about the books they read. If everyone can help make our libraries and our school more censored than all libraries would be much happier and more adventurous places.

Offensive materials @ CAPS4 are rubbish, but I'm talking about libraries and what's inside. Books, music, movies and magazines @ CAPS4 can offend someone, but not everyone. Removing these materials from the library shelves because a few people consider them to be offensive material is not a good idea, because if they find them offensive then someone is appreciating it somewhere. Not everyone will find an offensive book, song, movie or magazine and for this reason no book, CD, movie or magazine should be refused to the public in any library. My friends liked reading @ PERSON1's books but I didn't like them, but I didn't make them stop reading because of it, just like 'TO @ CAPS1 A @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3' @ CAPS4 be offensive but if you find it offensive, don't read it, outright. There will always be a person who doesn't want their child to watch a certain movie or read a book @ PERSON1, but that's not a good reason to remove material from the library shelves, let people read what they want to read, watch what they want and listen to what they want, there is no good reason to remove a book from the library shelves. We all have the right to read, watch and listen to whatever we like. Asking someone you've never seen to remove a book, movie, or magazine from the library because they find it a little offensive is like getting fired for not having much. silver. Many books around the world @ CAPS4 are considered offensive to at least one person and that person maybe two people are not allowed to tell anyone what they cannot read. Censorship in libraries is a horrible idea because not everyone will read this book or listen to this CD. Having a chance is all we need to read a book or listen to a song that could change our lives, for better or for worse, it should be our choice to read what we want. Any @ CAPS4 material should be considered “ offensive, ” but most of it is not offensive, just what people don't want their children to read. Offensive or non-offensive content cannot be reported by a few people but by an entire country. What one man considers offensive another man sees as a life changing. Anything can make someone change and to be that lucky we should have the freedom to read whatever we want. If you find a book offensive, remember it you had a chance to read it, now give someone else that chance.

The world today is filled with rasicm and criticism. Whatever we do is right or wrong, no in-between. Whenever you go out to eat or shop, you may hear offensive comments or pictures all around you. The newspaper, the news and the internet make events look worse than they are, if they refer to certain people they find them offensive. If you are looking for a good book to read, a movie to watch, or music to listen to while lying in bed, you choose what interests you. As you browse through the selection, you will see and recognize titles or images that offend you. I know when I do that I take the object and look and see what it says on the back. Somehow someone is going to find an offensive movie, music, book, or magazine. Let's say we remove anything that is offensive to people from all stores. What would be on the shelves? Nothing, @ CAPS1 has the right to write about anything they want, singers have the right to sing whatever they want. In @ ORGANIZATION1, everyone has freedom of expression. So libraries can't take something off the shelves just because someone @ NUM1 is offending. This is the purpose of different kinds of music and reading, so you can read and listen to whatever you want. Each @ CAPS2 has the choice of what he takes and listens or reads. If someone finds something offensive, they should not pick up the item. Then when that person complains about it, the bottom line is that it was their fault that they read it. There are going to be some offensive things about race, culture, appearance, and weight. It's just outside of life and how people act anymore. There's just a time when you have to be the taller person and ignore it and move on. So, no, I don't think offensive books, music, or magazines should be taken out of libraries or stores. We have the choice to choose what we read and listen to.

I think if the books, music, magazines or movies that you have in a library are not offensive, then they have a right to put them on the shelves. There is nothing wrong with having music and magazines in a library because if someone doesn't like to read but likes to listen to music or doesn't like to read books but likes to read magazines. I think it's good to have movies too. a book, movie, magazine, or music was found and it was offensive, then they should be taken off the shelves. can use them.

books, music, movies, magazine, ect. should not be taken off the shelves just because they are offensive or because children can get their hands on them and repeat what they have read, seen or heard. they should only stay because these so called “ offensive ” items that we have obtained can teach us very useful things such as what to do and what not to do and teach us our history or the history of another country. it's true that there are things in a library that children shouldn't see yet, but what's stopping them from having a look anyway? there are people who crave this offensive knowledge but are repeatedly told that they are not old or mature enough to handle such things but in more ways than one and it has been proven that some people do 'flourish better with truth which contains violence than it is hidden from them. without these things kids will never know what is really going on in the world around them and will be too shocked to do anything if they find themselves in the middle of something dangerous and without the correct knowledge of how to manage it or where to go. this is exactly why offensive things should stay in the library.

I think everyone has the right to hate or abhor Cetian works, but only the author of the work has the right to remove it from the shelf. The reason why not everyone can remove an artwork from the shelf is if one person hates the artwork but everyone loves it, then imagine how people who love the artwork must feel when 'they hear that it has been destroyed. Can you imagine how the author of a work would feel if thousands of his works were destroyed with no thought for others ? I can and I feel horrible just thinking about it, so I think that's why only the creator of anything should decide whether their work should be saved or destroyed. With these reasons I have discussed with you, please consider how everyone feels before destroying anything, whether it's a book, movie, song, or even a child's dreams, consider how they would feel if something of them was destroyed.

Dear Reader, Do you believe that certain books, magazines, films and music should be removed from library shelves if they are deemed offensive ? Many people around the world are asking the same question today. Some parents think they should be taken out, but others argue they should stay. I'll tell you what I think. As a citizen, I know some parents argue that certain magazines and books should be removed from the library if they are found to be offensive. Well, if they did that, there wouldn't be anything on the library shelves that would be closed. I mean, I see where some parents are coming from, some of these things are offensive and not suitable for kids, but if you don't want your kids to see it, just keep them away from that section of the library or don't bring it, you go get the book or magazine they want, and then you bring it home for them. In today's world everything is offensive to someone in the world, I mean everyone has their own opinion of what they think is offensive and what they don't think is offensive. So, ultimately, if you were to remove anything offensive from the library, it would be gutted. I want you all to read this quote and really think about what the author says, “ We can all think of a book that we hope none of our kids pulled off the shelves. But if I have the right to take this book off the shelf - this work that I abhor - then you have exactly the same right and everyone else too. And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us. (@ PERSON1). I don't know about you, but that really sums it all up for me. The truth is, you can't always do what you want, you just have to live with it and try to make it better for you and your family. If you read this article and really listen and consider what I'm saying, I think you will find that it would be much easier for you to act like the offensive books and magazines weren't there because if you try to get them removed, you won't even be able to go to the library anymore. sincerely the one and only, @ PERSON2

I think library censorship can be a good thing, but it can go too far. Removing films and magazines with unnecessary offensive material from the shelves might be a good thing. If these are removed, I don't think people would care that much. Removing these little things, however, could become a bigger problem. You have to decide how far is too far when removing items from the shelves. It all starts with a bad magazine that has a bad image of a movie star doing something offensive with surrounding text that is needlessly critical. A parent sees their child reading this in the library and they don't think it's appropriate, so they complain and the magazine is pulled off the shelf. Then an offensive film pops up and it is pulled from the shelves. Pretty soon everyone comes up with minor complaints about a lot of different things and almost everything has someone wanting this banned. Even if there was a limit set on what can be prohibited, people would still complain until what they want to happen. If the government has all of these complaints, it could simply shut down libraries to avoid examining every “ offensive ” piece of literature, film or work of art . The initial goal being to block offensive material ends with realizing that everything is offensive to someone. Even what might be considered a great job by most might be viewed as an abomination by some. Ultimately, a library shouldn't have the right to censor anything. The things that should be censored are a very small percentage and not worth the risk. Books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others. Libraries were created to give people the chance to be inspired. The library should not have the right to evade the reader's hand.

What are you doing @ CAPS1 ? A very big battle for many people is whether libraries should allow offensive material to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a really big deal. For those who care, their take on the matter is that offensive material should be removed from library shelves. Personally, I think it should be acceptable for " offensive " material to be on library shelves through @ ORGANIZATION1. What is the offensive conciter? Each person has their own opinion of what they think is offensive. For example, a young child @ MONTH1 thinks the word " stupid " is a swear word while some older people think it is not a swear word. If we removed all offensive material from libraries, there would be nothing left @ CAPS1. You @ MONTH1 think @ ORGANIZATION2 is a great book, but if you tell someone who thinks @ ORGANIZATION2 is wrong, @ MONTH1 thinks having @ ORGANIZATION2 on the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a different view of what is offensive, no one @ CAPS1 will ever be able to have a non-offensive library. A group of people @ CAPS1 cannot agree on what is and what is not. There are many websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to these websites and organizations to find out what they should personally look at in the library. It shouldn't be the job of libraries to say what you can and can't check out. Everyone is responsible for their actions. If a person wants to read a book or movie that some people find offensive, so be it. It's a free world. Some people @ MONTH1 do not approve of their choice, but again they have the right to read this book or listen to this music. In conclusion, let me clarify: no one should be able to say what you can and cannot have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or a book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read this book. In reality, the question should not be : " Should we take books, music, movies, magazines, etc. out of the library?" ? The question should be : ' Should I read this book, watch this movie or listen to this music?'. It's everyone's choice to read a book or listen to a @ LOCATION1. We are not responsible for what others do. It is not for the library to be the mother of all its patrons. Let there be libraries!

I believe offending books should be taken off the shelves. Some books are offensive and some are inappropriate. The librarian could get rid of the books, so little kids can '@ CAPS2 get the wrong book. Movies rated “ @ CAPS1 ” and above should be deleted. Anything with an " A " rating should be removed, libraries are a public place to rent and return, buy or sell, or to exchange movies, books, etc. health. Anything that is inappropriate could be censored with a black marker. The old library I used to go to had all the slang, cus words etc all marked with a black sharpie. Some of the movies were rejected from "@ CAPS2" rating for all of the above, magazines, also had marks on the pages, censored slag in the magazine. Music in the library was blocked, some of the music was not blocked, and the rest was the censored part of songs. Libraries should do the same as the old one.

Dear journal @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 my name is @ PERSON1 and I am a student attending @ ORGANIZATION1. I go to libraries a lot, and the things I see there shouldn't be there. Like the movies. They're fine, but they're all sitting together. So that means I'm a young woman. I see things that I know my mom wouldn't even approve of me watching. They censored movies right there. Sometimes I even browse the shelves and see the type of books my mom wouldn't even look at. They censored books in libraries like it's a book on @ CAPS3 or something. I have conversations with some of the workers sometimes, and they don't see anything wrong with little kids or teens looking at censored stuff. However, not everyone thinks this way. I don't think or think that there should be censored books in the library for children to be able to look at. It is not fair at all. When it comes to music, I agree with music in libraries because a lot of people listen to different kinds of music. As long as the music is something positive, but there are all kinds. You just have to pay attention to the music you listen to in a library because there are young people everywhere. There are kids around @ NUM1 in there, and younger too. They wouldn't know how to react to a song about killing people or shooting them somewhere. Then you never know what parents wanted them to know at a young age like that. I don't think real bad and bad music should be played in @ CAPS4 libraries. I don't believe the censored magazines should be there either. I really believe magazines are one of the main things censored in the library. There are also a lot of books. They shouldn't be there at all just for the sake of the kids and parents. They don't need to grow up fast, they need to enjoy life while they are young. And looking at censored stuff doesn't help at all. In conclusion, I really think something needs to be done about all of this censored stuff. Lots of people complain to @ CAPS1 when they come to @ CAPS4 libraries. What I'm asking of you is to help our @ CAPS4 libraries get these nasty things out. They can even create their own side of the libraries with stuff that is censored only for adults. I know this is the right thing and I know a lot of people agree with me. People only want the best for their children, and a library with a lot of censored stuff doesn't seem like the best. It just means they start badly. Sincerely, A student who believes in change

Everyone has a preference for literary works, such as books, magazines, movies, or music. Different types of these literary works are important to each person. If everyone had the right to completely remove a work they disliked, then no work would remain. Therefore, I believe that no material such as books, music, films and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places. Everyone has unique ideas, needs and preferences. A few years ago, I had a classmate who had different ideas than a myriad of people about religious persecution. He hated the idea of mixing people of different religions in one place. He wrote an article with all his ideas on how the world should work in terms of religion. He tried to publish it, but was unsuccessful because his work was considered offensive. Even though I don't agree with his ideas, I don't think his work should have been rejected. There could have been people in the world who agreed with his thoughts and were interested in reading them. There might even have been some ideas in his article that could have helped countries solve various problems. I think it is unfair that his article was rejected. People have different needs depending on what they need to accomplish. For example, I was reading a book the last @ DATE1 about a girl doing a racism project. She went to the library to look for a book on apartheid at @ LOCATION1 but could not find anything. She asked a librarian if there were any, but the librarian told her that books like these were considered offensive in this local library and that she should look elsewhere. I think this is unfair because the girl @ MONTH1 had nowhere to go to get information about her project. She should have had the right to access the information she needed for the project in order to avoid its failure. Another reason why no book should be deleted is simply because each has unique preferences. Around the world, there are books that some people would appreciate more than others. Literature should be able to be used for entertainment and convenience. If I went to a library now, I would find many selections that match my ideal novel or magazine. Every person should have this right. If people started removing materials that offend them, then there would be nothing left on the shelves and no one would be allowed to have access to the materials they want. In this world, diversity exists everywhere. People want, need and want different things and always will. Literary works are just one of them. If people start eliminating offensive material based on individual frustration or annoyance, then no books will be left on public shelves. Therefore, materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should never be removed from public places. These things are necessities for the world.

I THINK IF A BOOK IS FOUND OFFENSE THEN YOU SHOULD NOT READ IT. BECAUSE IF SOMEONE ELSE LIKES THE BOOK, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO READ THIS BOOK. MAYBE THIS IS AN INSPIRATION FOR THEM, MAYBE IT WILL LEAD THEM TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING THEY WANT IN THEIR LIFE. WHEN SOMEONE GOES INTO A LIBRARY, NO ONE CAN TELL THEM WHAT TO GET, THEY WILL MAKE THAT DECISION HIMSELF, SO WHEN A BOOK IS OFFERED TO YOU MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRIGHT THE AUTHOR AND TALK TO HIM. ABOUT THEIR BOOK. THINGS YOU MAY ACHIEVE BY USING THE AUTHOR IS A LETTER IN THE MAIL STATING THAT SHE IS SORRY FOR HURTING YOU WITH THEIR BOOK, ANOTHER MAY BE A VISIT FROM THE AUTHOR IN PERSON TO TELL YOU WHAT 'HE OR SHE IS SORRY FOR THE PAIN HE OR SHE BROUGHT TO YOU. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. ALSO NO, I DON'T THINK THE BOOK / BOOKS SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES BECAUSE JUST MAYBE IT WILL MOBILIZE SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD OF SETTING THEM. THE END.

“ Do you believe that certain documents, such as books, music, films, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive ? " @ CAPS1 these items should be removed from shelves if found to be offensive. First of all, they should be deleted because some people @ MONTH1 are offended by them. Some @ MONTH1 talk about race, religion or gender. No one wants to be criticized in a book or whatever. For example : rap music, all that is, it's just people wondering what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people @ MONS1 are offended, and I'm sure no parent wants their child to listen to this nonsense. So take them off the radio. Second, if a child picks up a critical book or film, or if that article can have a bad effect later on. They might start to criticize people for being different. Some books are about religion, some people just can't help their religion, they were born that way, so they know it and don't want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves. Third, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a same sex woman, and in this movie they were laughing at her. No one should be judged by the sex they like. She was very offended. So take them off the shelves. Penultimate, magazine writers take pictures of celebrities and cut them about three sizes smaller than they actually are and put them on the covers of fashion magazines or whatever. Why not just put this celebrity in there based on her actual height ? Some @ MONTH1 are offended. So just take pictures of celebrities and put them on the magazine at their actual size or take them off the shelves. In conclusion, in some of my observations and readings, some people quite often take offense at being of a different race, gender or religion. So I think some documents like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive.

Do you think libraries should have the right to remove books and movies from shelves if they find it offensive ? In my opinion, I don't agree and I think they shouldn't be able to take them off the shelves. A lot of people have different thoughts and opinions and I will spell out mine in the next few paragraphs. For starters, not everyone likes to read or watch the same types of books or movies. Some like romantic, spooky, mysterious and there are many more selections. Instinctively, if a person reads something they don't agree with, that doesn't mean the next person who reads it won't like it either. Sometimes I like to read books where people get hurt and sometimes get killed, but @ CAPS1 someone else is reading it, they might think it's horrible and very offensive. Another reason is @ CAPS1 I go to the library, expect to get the book I want to read and not what other people like. I once went to the library and was looking for a romantic book to read and couldn't find it. So I went up and I asked the lady at the counter and she said they didn't have it anymore, and I asked why and she told me that a lady thought it was wrong for children to read. In my opinion, maybe this lady didn't even like romantic books. They shouldn't be limited to what a person believes. The next reason is that the library put the movie or book on the shelf in the first place because they thought people would appreciate it. The writer or producer wouldn't be very happy if they found out that their movie or book has been taken out of the library because they find it offensive. Just give the book a chance and see how everyone likes it. I understand if everyone thought it was really offensive to take it off, but not just one person. Finally, my belief is that if they had the book in their library at some point, it should just stay there until it gets old and collapses. The library is open to all types of books, not just boring books. So I think the books shouldn't be taken off the shelves, they should just stay as they expected. If they don't like the book or movie, then suggest other people's family not to read it or have them read and see their reaction.

As you step into the heavenly sanctuary that is our library, you have opened up to a vast wealth of knowledge that is available to you with the click of a mouse, the push of a button or the turn of a page. There are those of the privileged few, however, who are under the paradigm that not all of this information is for everyone's eyes. They think he should be locked up, like it is an eyesore. Let me approach this point of view with retaliation and disgust on several levels in the following document. I am a musician. Music is my passion. My creative gears turn forever. Often times, I look to the works of other artists for inspiration, and the only place to get that music is, you guessed it, the library. How disappointed am I when I find that the music I want has been removed because it was self-explanatory. It wasn't the lyrics or the rude message that I was looking for, but the beautiful melodies and harmonies therein! It is not good to isolate the media without first seeing the good they contain and the strong feelings they should convey. We @ MONTH1 reject the World's Greatest Novel on the basis of racial disagreement or witchcraft. We @ MONTH1 are throwing a soulful song because of his lyrics. We @ MONTH1 trash a movie after only reading the title, without even giving it a chance. Is it right ? Even now @ MONTH1 are the ones who refuse to read your newspaper due to their disagreements with only one editor. It's not a good harvest in my good sense. I implore you, as a public, as people of sound mind and strong heart, to reconsider the censorship of those works which have a clear and true message and were forged for the good of our humanity. All things have a story to tell. A friend of mine once told me that there are three ways to absorb things that we find unwanted. We can reject, we can ignore, or we can absorb and interpret. Rejecting doesn't leave you smarter. Ignoring leaves you in fear. However, in order to absorb, you acquire new knowledge, whether it is a new culture or a new person. Everything should be taken with a grain of salt. Let’s observe something that we find immoral and then take the time to understand why it’s immoral, because these are the things that define us. If you don't see what is right and what is wrong, who can tell what is truly ethical? We need background material in our libraries, for our exhibition and for our exploration of new knowledge in our modern world.

No, documents should not be removed from libraries. First of all, most books, movies, and music are the best way to support different things. certainly the best means. Like a movie, some people like to see things in order to understand them. Because it takes time for some people to see instead of reading or listening. wrong way of having the wrong kind of thinking about something that makes it offensive to them. Like music is a great way to understand what someone is trying to say or convey. You need to take the time to really listen and find out what he's talking about. you never leave your mind here what they said. Some people leave a word or two to make you think of the song differently. So before you judge, listen to the whole song. A book, one of the best ways to understand where someone is coming from. A book is like a short life. If you judge a book by ignoring its first two paragraphs, you will never make sense of it. With a book, you have to give it a chance to search your mind so that you fully understand. A book can tell you a lot of things. So some people find it offensive. These types of materials should never be removed from laboratories. These things are great ways to figure things out. So if you take something offensive, try another way, maybe it's a better way for people to understand it. Without this material we would never understand, discovering anything in the world

When you think of a book, do you think of happy children's books or mysterious dark books? What if I said offensive books? Most of the magazines, music, books, and movies you take off the shelves today aren't as happy or mysterious as you think @ MONTH1. When I think of a movie that I want to watch, I think of something that will please me; not something I'm going to put out in the middle. What if you pick a movie that @ MONTH1 looks good on the cover and you read the back cover and it sounds good, but when you come home to watch it with your little sister or your little brother, it is exactly the opposite. You give it back? Do you turn it off and waste your money doing nothing about it ? Offensive books, movies, music and magazines should be removed from the store. If you're not going to finish it, then why is it there? I'm not going to watch or read a book if it won't make me feel good as a person or make me feel good. If people can sit there and write it down, act it out, or act it out, then we should be able to express our opinion on it whether it's good or not. People have feelings, if they are to be hurt by something that we should be enjoying, take them off the shelves. Do something about it. We should all be successful in doing something for others, and if not for ourselves.

There shouldn't be any sensitivity in library books, just think about how many great literary works no one would be able to get because they didn't meet your standards. People might not be able to read some of their good books. Would you really want to take this from people? If my argument hasn't changed your mind, you should at least put the detected books behind the counter.

I don't think there are certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off the shelves of a library if they could be deemed offensive. It's good to be unique, and no matter how inappropriate a topic may be, it's still factual and useful for learning. If anything, they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says something like “ adult content ”. @ CAPS1 repeats itself, and this quote reminds me of times in @ CAPS1 where we have to learn from our mistakes no matter how bad the topics are, like @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 in the Deep South. What about @ CAPS2, when @ NUM1 million @ CAPS7 were killed because they were @ CAPS7. @ CAPS7 @ MONTH1 finds these books offensive but that doesn't mean @ CAPS2 never happened. There are many offensive and contradictory images and stories about events that happened during @ CAPS2. Even though this is a very depressing and horrible subject, it is still good for our @ CAPS20 to learn what happened. And other categories should be read as they can help @ CAPS20 understand right from wrong and prevent them from making big mistakes in the future. The @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 started from @ DATE1 until @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14 @ NUM2. The @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 wreaked havoc on everyone in the @ LOCATION1A, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south most @ CAPS19 treated @ CAPS17 @ CAPS18 like dirt. They wouldn't let them into their schools, clubs, or churches, they were rude to them, and most horrible of all, they lynched them. There was a set of @ PERSON1 called '@ PERSON1', which was pretty much a list of @ PERSON1 to treat @ CAPS25 as unfairly as possible. If a kid picked up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings they would remember it all their life, and if that picture really bothered them they would have grown up all their lives, they would realize that what @ CAPS19 did to @ CAPS25 was unethical. Some books and magazines in the library are really self-explanatory, but we can't house our @ CAPS20's all their lives. Parents should sit down with their @ CAPS20 when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What will parents do when their @ CAPS20 goes to school and hears other @ CAPS20 talking about topics like sex ? @ CAPS20 might have a bad idea of sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents have never sat down and explained to them what sex is. I'm not saying go let your @ NUM3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by all means, but when @ CAPS20 hits a certain age their parents have to step in and talk to them about uncomfortable topics like puberty, sex and babies. It's time for parents to stop hiding the truth from their @ CAPS20, or hovering over their shoulders like helicopters. If @ CAPS20 doesn't learn the truth about the real @ CAPS13 and how many evil and manipulative people there are in @ CAPS13, when they go to college, they won't be able to defend themselves. If @ CAPS20 doesn't learn about @ CAPS1 and everything that has been done, it's kind of like we treat books like @ CAPS7 and @ CAPS17 @ CAPS18 have been processed. Just because these books are different from the others, we're just going to get rid of them, just like we tried to kill all of @ CAPS7 and @ CAPS25 because they were different. And it's wrong and inhuman

Censorship in libraries occurs when a librarian has the right to remove certain material, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library, if the item is inappropriate. . I believe that libraries should not have censorship. Personally, I think it should be in the library if it could have that power. If it's a library where there are always smaller children, then I think they might have the power of censorship. In conclusion, it should be the responsibility of the parents of the little ones to make sure that their child's book is appropriate for their son or daughter. Now let's say if this was just a normal library with both a mix of adults and kids, then I'd say there's still no need for censorship at all. First for the most part, because it is your choice of the article, if you think it is offensive then don't read it, watch it or just listen to it. Second, it wouldn't be fair to people in the library who like a certain item, but can't use it anymore just because someone thinks it's offensive. Plus, people were just starting to say that they thought this article wasn't suitable for the library just because they didn't like it. Finally, members of the library would have the same rights as librarians. So many members have such different feelings about the items, that so many different items would be taken off the shelf, that in the end there would be no more books. In conclusion, personally, I don't think censorship is necessary in libraries. This would not be necessary because the parents of the smaller children would have to be responsible enough to check the child's items, and also because there would be so much conflict with the items taken off the shelf and the number of items removed from the shelf. There for, I believe that censorship is not necessary in libraries.

I know some people find certain books offensive, cruel, or racist, but most of the time people write @ CAPS4 because that's how they feel or what people want to read. Books are a privilege and we should be able to use that privilege. People need to learn that it's okay for books to be a little hard sometimes. @ CAPS1 isn't the most user-friendly place ever, and books can help spread it with less difficulty than experiencing @ CAPS4 firsthand. I know all books should be left on the shelves because just because it's offensive to someone doesn't mean you should remove @ CAPS4. For every book, someone will find @ CAPS4 offensive because of something. If the cause is if it is offensive then all the pounds should be gone. If anyone has taken the time to go out and write and book and make sure everything on @ CAPS4 is correct then why should we stop them from letting people read @ CAPS4. They have the right to write @ CAPS4 and we have the right to read @ CAPS4 and no one should take it down just yet. If anyone has written a book on hollocost, people are very offended by it, but they are not trying to get rid of @ CAPS4. so why should a book be any different because it's not a big event like @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. It seems so upset that people who go to such lengths to get rid of a book just because they are offended by @ CAPS4. I think they just need to suck up @ CAPS4 and move on. if they don't like @ CAPS4, then don't read @ CAPS4. So someone who wants can not take that away from people who want to read @ CAPS4. I remember a time when someone wanted to read a book in their library and he said, "Oh you can't read this because @ CAPS4 was deemed offensive." @ CAPS4 got me to say that they would decide how someone else feels about a book. @ CAPS4 makes me so angry that they decide how someone feels about a book. they must be magical because I didn't know they knew how someone else feels about a book or anything for that matter. we have books here that are kept behind the librarian's desk and if you really wanted to read this book, it's behind her desk. and I'm okay with that because at least they have @ CAPS4 that people can read if they really want to. This is what I think should happen if they have books that they think are too offensive to people. At least try to make an effort to be right as citizens of @ ORGANIZATION1. Let's take another aspect about money here. the book you so badly wanted to disappear from a library has most likely been paid for by you, the taxpayer. So you and a lot of others paid for this book and now you want to waste that money. It just doesn't make sense that you want to waste this money after paying @ CAPS4. It just makes me wanna say wow do you really wanna be this upset by a book. Does @ CAPS4 make you feel better because you got pissed off about a book and now it's gone. Good for you mission accomplished. All you did was get mad and wasted money. People just need to look at the big picture, not just themselves, but others as well. When they pick up a book because you've been offended, it offends me. It offends me tremendously because now you have ruined something that didn't need to be taken apart. This is how I feel about this topic. I am very upset that people are doing this and going to such lengths to ban a book from a library. If you wrote a book and people did that to you, how would you feel. I know you would feel like dirt for someone to do this to your hard work. People just need to calm down, smell the roses, and forget about the things that don't matter. Take a step back and think for a second and say, " Will it really affect me if I take this book off the shelf ." @ CAPS4 also drives me crazy that the library bought the book and now it's gone, just as the money has gone to the waist because the book just went missing. This is how I feel about getting rid of the pounds.

Do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines and other materials from shelves because they personally disagree with the content ? Censorship in libraries is a subject for which the answer is not clear. Some people think it is their right to dispose of books, music and movies with what they think is “ offensive ” material. Others think library censorship is bad, that people should have access to whatever they want. Censorship is simply a means of preventing the knowledge of those who wish to know more about worlds outside their own. In @ DATE1's company, there are no limits. The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary and musical art, but it can also create material that is not suitable for all age groups. Censorship of libraries is one way to keep this " inappropriate " material out of young and curious eyes. However, what @ MONTH1 is unacceptable for children to see @ MONTH1 is fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person strongly believes that @ CAPS1 created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or movie that supports the theory of evolution. If a parent doesn't want their child to watch @ CAPS2, they would rather their children not see an @ CAPS2 disc in the kids section for their child to see. If a person has a deep grudge against @ CAPS4, it is unfair to others if all @ CAPS5 content is removed from the shelves of a library. If a person does not wish to have access to certain "offensive" subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to them. But it is not in their right to hide it from the sight of others who @ MOIS1 wish to learn about said questions. Writing is a form of self-expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form one's own opinions and thoughts when not exposed to the opinions of people outside their community? It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain topic just because one or two other people object to the content. If books and films containing information unacceptable to a person have been removed, then everyone has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. Eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another. It is one of the beauties of being a citizen @ CAPS6: freedom of expression. By living at @ LOCATION1, one has the right to read or learn whatever he wants. Censorship prevents learning from those who want to. Parents are perhaps among the biggest supporters of library censorship. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they don't want their child to see a devil worship movie or the @ CAPS7 era doesn't mean that the parent has the right to prevent everyone else from seeing it. Children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage openness and acceptance from others. Libraries are a source through which young people can learn about the religions, beliefs and customs of the outside world. It shouldn't be up to parents to decide what gets on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library. In conclusion, it can be said that library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have the right to read, listen or watch whatever they want. While it is acceptable for parents to protect their children from certain subjects, it is unacceptable for these same parents to prevent other members of the community from learning. The freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, “ … And then we don't have any more books on the shelf for any of us.

Why do we have books that are considered offensive ? If they're inappropriate, why do we keep bringing these books, magazines, movies, and most importantly, music into the world ? Let me tell you why, because the folks at @ LOCATION1 have unfortunately gone over the service time of @ CAPS1, @ PERSON1, @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 and many other non-offensive shows. But with the shows, books and movies airing today are highly inappropriate for young viewers. @ DATE1 @ TIME1 the cartoons are over, at least the good cartoons like @ CAPS4 and @ PERSON3, @ ORGANIZATION1, @ CAPS5, ect, those cartoons, that I was watching, that taught me to be @ CAPS6, @ CAPS7, and @ CAPS8 passed out. With the cartoons that are supposed to be good for kids, all of them show @ CAPS22 the same and that @ CAPS22 @ CAPS9, @ CAPS10, @ CAPS11 and all the other @ NUM1 deadly sins. They show them without explaining anything that might help the child in life, and that @ CAPS22 @ CAPS12. We can @ CAPS23 take books off the shelves, make directors quit directing, rappers quit rapping or quit pornography, but we can restrict it to a point. It will still be there in weather @ CAPS22 at the black market or in adult stores. Fortunately, there are ways to let your kids watch these shows. Restrictions on TV, make offensive books, magazines in a library a restricted area that no one can enter unless they are @ NUM2. There is @ CAPS22 a lot to say about the music out there. This can be and @ CAPS22 very offensive. I was born and raised with old school country music and unfortunately country music has gone to the dogs. Sorry to say but the music change started at the start of @ LOCATION2 @ CAPS13, with the hippies. As they all jumped on @ CAPS14, @ CAPS15, and @ CAPS16, they brought the new @ CAPS17 and @ CAPS18 to life. So he's been here for @ NUM3 years, @ CAPS22 @ CAPS23 is leaving. Anything we can do @ CAPS22 hope our kids will @ CAPS23 turn on the radio @ CAPS22 tuned to that shit and say "@ CAPS19 that sounds like good music". Along with pornographic magazines, they've been around since @ PERSON2 was at its peak. He @ CAPS22 @ CAPS23 is going to stop whatever we're doing. All we can do @ CAPS22 is blocking him out of our lives. We can try to keep it out of our children's eyes, but it will help @ CAPS23, they will always be known to this world. I think we should move these things to another part of the library, which only adults can access if it can be done in the library. Then we will move on to the music, then to the shows. Remember it will always be there, whatever we can do as @ CAPS20 @ CAPS22 tries to keep it out of the reach of our children. We can't stop it but we can try to keep it out of our eyes. With the will of @ CAPS20, this MAY be done. FAIL @ CAPS22 @ CAPS23 @ CAPS24 @ CAPS25 !!!

Libraries @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2 ? This world is unlike any other world, but some of our ideas are blocked because they are offensive, it is obscure. There are a lot of things that are offensive in a library like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Now libraries are a place where people can relax and grab an @ CAPS1 book to read. When they come across this very offensive book, why put it back. Say something and tell the principal that this book is too offensive to be in a library. There are kids in the library who might be looking for something to read, they @ MONTH1 stumble upon a very inappropriate movie. Things like that shouldn't be in a public library. As a citizen @ CAPS3.S, I think this stuff should be removed for the shevles. Why would they be up there in the first place, what is this world turning into. Some of these books are now due for censorship. Because of all the words @ CAPS2 in there, kids could learn all that bad language. How about some of this music, don't you think some lyrics can be offensive to some people. When rock stars, rappers, etc ... write lyrics there, they don't think about what other people think of them. They might just put the worst languages in their songs, they don't care, they just want the money. Why not write a letter expressing your concerns. Things in libraries like books, movies, magazines, etc. should all be checked and blacked out. Some of them shouldn't even be displayed in libraries. There are kids in the library now, why would you go this far to put things like that in a public library. Take a magazine for example, a magazine has stuff that talks a lot about sex, drugs, and other stuff. Some people might like it, but for a twelve year old boy to pick up something like this and start reading it. For me this is wrong, I don't know anyone else, but it shouldn't be displayed in a library. Now I went to a library before they found anything inappropriate there. But I really didn't think about it, but when I saw an eleven year old boy reading about drugs, sex and violence, it was something he could understand. He sees it in a book so why not try something in a book. There are some shocking things in this world these days, but putting things like that in a library is horrible. This is where censorship comes in by editing a lot of stuff in the library. People today and today don't care, but they should start to care more. It's just my opinion why I think it's wrong to put all this @ CAPS2 stuff in a public library. I think it's something kids don't need to see what you think about it

I believe if that book, music, or magazines is offensive and people don't like it, then maybe they should get out of the library. There are a lot of things that people love to read and listen to too. Maybe for those who don't like it, they can go to another library. There are many around us. If a person didn't like what they saw in this library, then why go back ? This might be offensive to some people, but not to all. So if people try to fight to remove them then the people who love them are going to be angry because they like to read it and they are having a good time. Like I said before, if they don't like it, there are a lot more libraries out there that probably won't have it. Libraries should be able to put whatever they want on their shelves. They could put it behind their back and whoever wants it and go and ask for it. Or they could go put something and do it where you know what's out there and if you don't like it then go for it. There is more than one shelf in a bookcase, if you don't like it then don't go there. If there is an inscription, there will be a reason for you to go there and take offense and complain about it. You also need to think about others. People who like it and go to libraries to read books, listen to music, rent a moving house, read magazines, they can't do it anymore. Then they'll be crazy and that's just another fight. Would anyone have this much drama, I wouldn't. It would be too much for me and Hanle. People are now these days. No one will know what I would do if it weren't for books, music, movies or magazines. How would you feel if you lost this? Probably not too happy. I believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should stay on the shelves in the library. Just because a few people don't like it and want to fight for it, really should sit down and watch what they're doing. There is more than one library in this world. If you don't like the things the library puts on its shelves, go find a new one. It's not worth fighting and spending all that money on what few people have these days just to fight over what is on a library shelf. Not even worth it. Like I said before, you don't like it. don't look at it, read it. listen, nothing. Stay away and you won't be offended.

Do you believe that certain documents, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive ? No I don't think these items should stay on the shelves for the appropriate ages. If you are over eighteen you should be able to choose whatever topic they want. If you are under eighteen, there should be an age requirement and also require parental consent. For those under the age of eighteen, when they get a library membership they should have to verify their date of birth and what their parents are asking their child to be able to read, play or watch. Libraries and bookstores should rate magazines or books, just like movies. This will promote less anger of parents towards their children who listen to music or read inappropriate books, magazines or video games. Now, if bookstores sell these books to underage children without parental consent, legal action can be taken. It would be pretty much the same as selling alcohol or cigarettes to a minor. Based on my observations with my little brother, my mom chose to let him play inappropriate video games. For example, these games consisted of violence, sex, drugs and foul language. As a result, I notice that my brother does not obey or treat my mother with the respect he should. He also misbehaves at school all the time. This is just one example among many that I know of. Even if the parent allows their child to watch offensive movies, play inappropriate video games, or read certain books that are not suitable for their age, they should still be of a certain age. Some parents make bad parenting decisions, and that will reflect them later in life. So my overall opinion would be no. Keep books on the shelf for people who are mature enough to watch, read, or play. If they limit the sale of these items to minors, these kids @ DATE1 won't have as many crimes together. There would be less violence, crime or drug abuse. Keep all of this in mind. @ ORGANIZATION1

Today in the media there are a lot of things that can be considered offensive. Movies, books, songs, and magazines are some examples of where someone might find something offensive. I believe that everything that is put in the media has a purpose. If someone thinks something is offensive, I think they should just remove what they find offensive and not take it away from everyone as well. When a song artist comes up with a song, there is a reason why they put what they do in their songs. Sometimes they do it to make the public understand. When someone finds a movie offensive, there's a reason it's like that; it is to send a message. If people find the film offensive, they just shouldn't submit to it. If they don't watch the film, they will have no reason to be offended. Some books in libraries are deemed offensive to some people simply because they do not agree with what is in them. If there's something in a book that you don't agree with, don't just pull the book off the shelf and throw it away. Other people might enjoy reading this book. If the book is thrown away, no one will have a chance to read it except the person who threw it away. I do not believe that media deemed offensive to part of the public should be removed. Not everyone finds certain things offensive in the media. Again, everything that is put on the market and in the media has a purpose; its goal is to make others understand.

Some books, magazines, music and films should not be put on the shelves of a library. Children can learn rude or unpleasant things that their parents might not find right for their child. There are some things that can be offensive in a library, such as prejudice books or music. Often the music uses swear words or states certain views on politics. Libraries need to take control of this issue in the right way. Getting rid of the material is not the right thing to do. Libraries need to better monitor certain sections of the library. They could do this by not letting the children leave their parents. This way parents can know and control what their children see. Then there is the matter of offending people. These problems could be solved simply by placing signs in different places of the bookcase. These signs may be in large bold letters indicating " Some things in this section may be offensive ", " @ CAPS1 control is required beyond this point ". Libraries should be more aware of what people think about the way they are organized and presented to the public. Libraries should put themselves in the shoes of the public, to see how they would like some of these things to be shown to their children. Also, look at things from the perspective of how some things might be offensive, to resolve issues. Once, while in a library, I was offended by a book title that was against my religion. After seeing this, I thought if there was a sign or something around me warning me, I shouldn't have seen it. Other things like this happened in a library like once my brother rented a movie that my parents didn't approve of. But with the way the libraries are set up and controlled, my brother was able to rent the film and sneak it past my parents. Other children like my brother could do the same things, only worse, like looking at an inappropriate magazine or reading certain books that parents would not approve of. These types of events have to stop before something really bad happens. Libraries need to take control and show that they know how to present things to the public in the right way. The actions that are happening in libraries today are not doing well. Installing signs and requiring @ CAPS1 control can reduce or even eliminate these unapproved occurrences

Offensive things should be removed for many reasons which will be explained later. Things in magazines should be appropriate for people to see. The first reason they should be taken off the shelves is that it might offend someone important like the president of @ ORGANIZATION1 or @ CAPS1 in your state. If the topics in the reading material are offensive to someone, they must say something in defense. If they don't speak, no one will think of changing anything. What I don't understand is why people would let this ridiculous stuff be put in magazines, music, and movies anyway. Even if the films are a little different. Movies are mostly just ideas made up by people. So if people are offended, it's just to start. To offend well things in books, the author probably has a reason for it. It can be something offensive, but people should know about it in case it has to do with someone you know. For example, in the newspaper I read an article about our current president. @ PERSON1 was asked about his birth certificate. People didn't believe he was born at @ LOCATION1. Personally, I think he was actually born in the @ CAPS2.S. But of course, they saw his certificate proving he was a member, so the mess should be dropped and forgotten. It was unwarranted at the start. I wonder what went through his head when someone asked him this question. I'm sure someone would have seen it before they even became president.

What if someone finds your favorite book offensive? Inappropriate materials should be kept out of the minds of young children. On the other hand, you can't protect people from things they should know or already know. Everyone has different things that they think are offensive, so one person might think a book is so bad that it should be recalled from the shelves, but another person @ MOIS1 doesn't see a problem with that. Children should be protected from materials that @ MONTH1 injure them in some way. Children do what they see and hear, so they are likely to try to copy harmful things they read. Bad influences can even be magazines with celebrities caught red-handed or doing bad things and young minds see this as "cool" and @ MONTH1 tries to follow suit. Children and young people see and hear much worse things at home, on television and even at school than in some books. Children need to be protected, but you cannot protect babies' lives. They will be introduced to many bad influences in their lifetime, but it should be the job of parents to teach their children to say no and stay away from bad things. Children can learn much worse from anything in the library just by sitting at home. Libraries are places of public use and the public covers a lot of different types of people and someone will always find something awkward with somting or the like. People have different views, beliefs, and religions, and books on these may be offensive to some, but the lifestyle of another. As The Quote from Katherine Paterson, said that if we take every book or material that anyone finds offensive from the shelves, there will be no more books in the libraries. Yes, there are books which are not always very presentable to a certain group of people, but they should be allowed to be read if someone wants to read them. It is not the job of libraries to be biased against certain books because someone does not agree with it. The books should be of a wide variety like the people who read them. Children are also protected from books if they have learned the morals that allow them to make mature choices.

I believe that any book or movie that is in the library is in the library for a good reason. The world is full of things that are going to hurt and make a person feel bad about themselves, and there are things in the world that will make you feel like you are on top of the world. Yes, there are things that children can see and are not expected to see, and these things are not usually on display for the student until they reach a mature and responsible age. Life is full of things and as children grow older they will learn, show things that parents find uncomfortable. Such as : books that show people with disorders, books about romance, movies with swear words and sex scenes in movies, violence, some parents don't @ CAPS1 even want their kids to see a simple kiss on the cheek. Which I find really weird because things like this are going to happen in life. On the other hand, if your kid is doing things they shouldn't @ CAPS1 be doing, then okay. Take the theater. I also agree that a child @ NUM1 should not @ CAPS1 be viewed as sex and show what women have and what boys have on their bodies. Their minds shouldn't @ CAPS1 even be fixed on this. Books, movies, shows @ CAPS1.v should not @ CAPS1 be deleted because they show what life is like and what will happen when you get older.

Debates are an integral part of our society today. Everyone has an opinion about how things should be in the world, and no one is necessarily right. Books that show how other cultures behave, which to the people described in the book @ MONTH1 seem offensive, are important because we as people need to absorb other cultures as much as possible. Our businesses are located in other countries, many people living at @ LOCATION1 speak multiple languages, and people have the right to read things that @ MONTH1 is in fact offensive to one race of people. Businesses thrive in other countries. Much of the income in our countries comes from our factories and companies in other countries. @ LOCATION2 is a place where a lot of business is happening for @ ORGANIZATION2. If we as @ CAPS1 can't find out more about @ CAPS2, how can we learn their business methods and way of life ? To @ CAPS2 these @ MONTH1 books are offensive, but to us they are learning tools describing the @ CAPS2 culture. Being bilingual is a trend that millions of people adhere to. High schools require that we learn a foreign language, even if these are just the basics. Schools are doing this so that we can go to other workforce countries. Learning their language and habits comes from books. The Mexican people may not like the way we portray them in our stories, but it is necessary to learn more about them. In @ ORGANIZATION1 there are all kinds of freedoms that we use freely as @ CAPS1. Free Speech says we can say whatever we want when we live at @ LOCATION1. Books are not excluded from this rule. I'm sure other countries have offensive books about us. It is a common theme all over the world. Businesses thrive in foreign countries, so we need to be able to read books about them, even if they seem offensive. Learning new things is something every school teaches and there should be no limit to what we can learn. If a book has vulgar language and sexual scenes, it should be removed from the children's section of the library, not completely banned. It is the same with other populations of people. They can't take offense at what we have to say because worse has been said about them than we can possibly put in a book. Learning is a necessary tool in our society and nothing should be restricted.

Books are very important to our society. They hold a special place in our hearts and contain much of the knowledge of our world. Everyone has their own opinion of what should and shouldn't be on the books. I totally agree that little kids shouldn't buy a book that has explicit content that they shouldn't be reading. However, some people including myself have looked at or bought books and then realized what exactly was described in those books. I don't believe that anything with certain content should be taken off the shelves. I can think of many books that could be considered offensive and that are still on the shelves of many school and public libraries. All books on @ CAPS1 and even @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, such as '@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5's @ CAPS6' can be taken in the wrong context. These books contain language that is not appropriate for children. But we still see them on our shelves. Why? Because these books, and many more, are very important to us. The books should stay on their shelves because, as Katherine Paterson skillfully put it, "... And then we don't have any more books on the shelves for any of us." @ CAPS7 means that if everyone took out books that they thought were personally offensive, there would be no books. Books are essential for learning things. We have put all our knowledge into it, even hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago. When @ LOCATION2's libraries were burnt and / or destroyed, we thought our knowledge was gone forever. Thank goodness for the backup system that no one had known about in @ LOCATION1. I myself have read the @ ORGANIZATION1. I believe it wholeheartedly, but I know people who don't believe in @ CAPS8 and have taken some of the things that are said in @ ORGANIZATION1 to take personally. I believe @ ORGANIZATION1 is the most important book in the world. Without @ ORGANIZATION1, no one would know the wonderful things our @ CAPS8 above has done for us, and what they are doing for us now. However, some people may take what @ ORGANIZATION1 says offensive when it comes to gay people and divorce. But would we allow gay people or divorced men and women to take @ ORGANIZATION1 off the shelves ? Of course not ! If we did not allow them to take this important book down, then why should we allow other books to be taken down? Books are so important to us and our world. They hold the knowledge of our world, and they hold our hearts too. Think about what our world, our knowledge, our society would be like if we didn't have these precious things. Can you imagine it? I can not. Books are one of the most important things we have in the @ CAPS7 world. Just because someone finds something offensive in a written assignment doesn't mean everyone will. Books, if they are offensive to anyone, should be kept on our shelves for our future generations so that they @ MONTH1 learn and grow on our knowledge of our past

In today's world, children are exposed to a lot of inappropriate things as of late. They hear things from their older siblings, see uncensored programs on TV, hear words in music, and even learn things from books. The question is whether or not libraries should get rid of inappropriate books, movies, music and magazines. Children can read whatever they want with their parents' permission, but in today's society some parents just don't take the time to worry about it, absorbed in their work. One way the company can deal with this problem is to set age limits for books. There were times my mom wouldn't allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that I wasn't ready to learn. While I'm lucky my mom cares what I read, some parents don't. This is why an age limit would be useful to keep our youth modest. Librarians, or a national book association, might decide whether a book's content is suitable for a certain age. This would allow children to read about debauchery issues that they shouldn't know about. In addition, @ CAPS1 books should be more readily available. These types of books teach good morals and how to live a good, full life. In schools across the country, many @ CAPS1 authors are not in public school libraries. By putting these types of books in libraries, students would be more aware of them and most likely would be interested in learning from them. Another problem that libraries face is music and movies. It's nice to be able to go to the library and watch a cd or even a movie. But, some of them have terrible language and scenes that are not suitable for children. What can the general public do about it? Well, demand that all music and videos with non-generalized content for children be removed from libraries. This would prevent children from seeing and hearing actions that they should not copy. There are ratings on movies for a reason, so why not use them. Anything above @ NUM1 must be undefined in libraries. If the movie has content that a child under the age of thirteen shouldn't see, then the movie should be released. Magazines also provide a source of learning. Some are very educational and give students ideas for inventing a new invention or a way to help others. But, some have content that is not suitable for children. So, like books, magazines should also have notes. The @ CAPS3 magazine, for example, has articles that are too crazy for students to read. Magazines like this should be placed in an adult-only section where students cannot view them. Magazines also feature images that in recent times would have been illegal to publish. But, in today's standards, they can be put in magazines. These magazines should not even be allowed in libraries in our country. America's standards for what is okay to read, watch, watch and listen have changed dramatically. Children learn things they shouldn't know until a later age, at a very young age. Society must place strict restrictions on what is fair and what is not for children. Personally, I think there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch, read and listen to. My parents were very strict about it and ultimately I think it benefited my learning process. Also, I think libraries should get rid of books that once would have been a shame to read. Parents today are not as in tune with what their children are doing as they have been in recent years. Thus, society must impose a strict rule on what libraries offer and what they do not.

It will be a test to see if people finding anything offensive in a library or in music should be censored. It's also about whether you think it should be taken off the shelves because some people find it offensive. The way I look or my own opinion is that they should censor most things in libraries and music, but not get rid of them because someone finds it offensive. If you think about it, those unspoken documents like books that some people find offensive might be an appropriate book for someone else to relate to as they grow up. On the other hand, they should be more careful about it so that when young children listen to the radio or read a book, they don't get the wrong idea. We should censor things but only to a certain extent and not overdo it. In the long run, this could help with a cleaner, safer population, as these are things that censor people who don't hear the bad and only hear the good in life. You never know you could make a big difference by doing this. The reason I wouldn't want to go out and censor everything is because you can't stop everyone from doing it. You can always try it, but that's one of the main reasons I wouldn't try to get rid of it, as a sertan person might find it offensive. I can understand that if you take it off yourself that someone finds it offended, but only move it to wear it, no one will find it offensive. I'm not saying it's wrong to do this, but I think it could and probably would make a lot of people angry. But hey what can I say what the government did that we don't like or can't do nothing about it. And that's all I have to say about it.

Books, movies, magazines, music, etc., constitute a large part of our entertainment system in our lives today. Whether informational or just for entertainment, there are many forms of entertainment that can be found in your local library today, whereas in the past most libraries only held books. Although our entertainment today is very different from what it was then and will be very different from what it will be in the future. In today's society, books, magazines, music, movies, etc. can be found in your local library and contain many different types of material. Some documents could be informative about our solar system or about the human body. Another material could be an action, horror, or love filled fictional story. Some documents might also be filled with true, inspiring and inspiring stories. Anyway @ MONTH1, these types of things @ MONTH1 are more offensive to some people than others and @ MONTH1 is not suitable for younger people. Certain books, films, magazines, music, etc., containing offensive, inappropriate or rude material should not be banned from libraries simply because younger than adults should not read them, or because those who do not dislike the material believe that this material does not belong to the library. In general, most libraries are quite large and organized in different sections throughout the building. One area can be for fiction books and another for non-fiction books, another area can be reserved for children's books and another for magazines, movies, music, etc., all based on different types and genres. Just do this for documents that should only be read by adults, not children or adolescents. Take the books that @ MONTH1 contain offensive material, or @ MONTH1 is not suitable for people younger than adults and place them in their own divided section in the library. When a book in this section is checked out, just request an @ CAPS1 from the person checking that book to make sure they are of legal age. It can also apply to movies, magazines, music, etc. which are placed in this section. Some materials found in libraries that @ MONTH1 are offensive to one person @ MONTH1 are not offensive to others. Removing these offensive materials from the library will not benefit everyone, and @ MONTH1 will disappoint some people who do not find these offensive materials. Placing these certain materials in their own section is the best way to go for the benefit of everyone. As you can see, just because someone @ MONTH1 finds certain content in magazines, books, music, movies, etc. to be offensive, rude or inappropriate, doesn't mean everyone is doing it. . It also does not mean that you should completely remove and dispose of all materials that contain offensive or inappropriate material. Dividing these specific materials into their own section and regulating who @ MONTHS1 reviews them is really the best way to go. It is best for everyone, so those who want to read this material can always go to their library and check out that book, magazine, etc., and those who do not wish to have anything to do with this material worry about find offensive or inappropriate material, as they will be in their own divided section

I think there are some documents that shouldn't be taken off the shelves due to censorship. Different sections of the library should be offered. Everyone has different opinions on what they like to read or watch. You must do what you want at your own risk. I think the censorship shouldn't affect the library. The library should offer different sections, so a children's side, a teenager's side and an adult side. The kids' side should have books that only kids should see by age group. Kids shouldn't have to worry about censorship because they shouldn't be offered something that a librarian wouldn't want them to see and they should only be able to check it out. on their side of the library. A teenage side shouldn't have censorship because a lot of kids know a lot of things they shouldn't, so it wouldn't affect them that much. Books that teens read are more likely to have bad language and inappropriate things. Teenagers when they read or see things don't really influence them that much. The music teens listen to, they already know what most songs are about, so why only offer censored music in libraries ? Why would you want to try to delete something when it is already known ? An adult side shouldn't have censorship, adults should be able to read, watch, and watch almost anything. Adults are the ones who see and hear everything. It would be pointless to get rid of things on the shelves. They already know a lot. Why get rid of the books other @ MONTH1 read. It's a library, so it should just offer things that would increase intelligence, not decrease it. Censorship is unnecessary, you must do whatever you want at your own risk. Things in movies, books, magazines are all over the world. Why try to block out negative things when they are all around you. If someone finds something wrong, so be it, there are a lot of things that worry them in today's society. You choose what you want to read and make your choice for yourself. If you are able to read it or if it is the right decision, check it. You enter the library at your own risk and choose the criteria or selection you are going to choose. The library is full of different options and a plethora of different likes and dislikes. If you don't have to watch something, it's up to you to get what you want out of it. Everyone likes different things like movies, books, magazines, and music. If the library had censorship, it would lose a lot of material because of the opinions of people who didn't care about others. Everyone likes different things and wants a wide variety of things that they like. The library is where you go when you need books, movies, etc. Why close someone's opinion the selection of books, and if it was the only type of selection or he likes to read book. I think the censorship shouldn't affect the library. The library should have different sections for certain age groups. Books, magazines, and music in the library should all be at your own risk to view them. Everyone has different oppions in the library. Censorship would be a bad decision if they implemented this decision. The library would not offer as many things and probably less things would be checked. Therefore, I think censorship should not remove books from library shelves.

I personally think of certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not have to be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. First of all, how do we define offensive? Is it something that discriminates against a certain group of people? Is this something that creates negative attention? Is this something we don't like? Anyone can walk into a library and find something they didn't like, but that doesn't automatically mean it's offensive. National Geographic magazine often has pictures of naked people, as does @ CAPS1 magazine. So which one should we put the censorship on? The answer is we don't put one in because it would start a big argument which is offensive and is not. This would cause a conflict between two different parties. It is only offensive when we make it offensive. We don't have to watch something we don't like. We all have a choice and we can choose not to pick up something that we might consider offensive. The @ ORGANIZATION1 @ MONTH1 does not get along with the @ CAPS2 but if the two were in a library with their two sacred books on the shelves, they cannot say that one person's book is offensive to another because it does not agree with theirs. We sometimes forget that we have the amendment that allows us freedom of speech and of the press. We @ MOIS1 don't like what a person posts but it doesn't make their work offensive as it might be to a certain group who like them which is not offensive to them. Everything in the library has a purpose and if it doesn't fits our purpose, there is no way it offends us. The library is a place for books, music, movies, magazines, etc. We come to the library to consult books for research in order to learn. We also go to the library to read the last book in a series. Putting censorship on these things wouldn't allow us to do that. We can't finish our research project because someone thought a book was shocking or we can't listen to the new @ CAPS3.Dre album released because some people think the lyrics are too shocking. Putting censorship would bother the general public more than not having censorship, because if everyone can check what they want from the library, everyone is happy.

We all hope that one day our children won't choose a book or magazine that they aren't supposed to read. Children don't know any better. But why should we have movies, books, etc. censored, because of their little children everywhere. If I had the right to keep the books, etc. on the shelf, I would. I think we should be able to have uncensored books on the shelves. If everything was censored, we really wouldn't have anything to read or watch. To have censored everything is just not fair to everyone. Anyone should be able to watch whatever they want without having to be censored. If people's favorite movies or music were censored it probably wouldn't be so fun for them anymore, they'll probably stop watching them. I don't believe they should have censorship in libraries. Some materials like CD songs are sometimes mildly offensive, but that's just life. If you think it's offensive, don't listen to it. That doesn't mean they have to take it off the shelf. Maybe other people like that kind of music or etc. That doesn't mean they have the right to remove it because of it. If they did, it's really unfair. Children these days see more and know more about what they are not supposed to know, such as swearing. If a kid sees swear words in a magazine in the library and their parents get angry, it's in the magazine. The parent shouldn't be really angry and take this offense, and think it shouldn't be theirs. The library should not have to censor the cause of this incident. Children will hear it or see it again sooner or later. I would keep the right of librarians to have things uncensored, if I had the choice. These are a few ideas that I think they shouldn't have to censor movies, music, etc. in the library.

Libraries have a variety of materials ranging from books to movies. Most of them are intended for a general audience, and many people can read or watch whatever they want. However, some of the literature and other materials that you find @ MONTH1 in libraries are not intended for certain people, such as young children. Censorship takes material that these certified people shouldn't read away from everyone. Many people want censorship not only in libraries, but in many aspects of life. Censorship is not inherently bad, but it restricts people, who would normally have access to a certain topic, to a general category. Not everyone likes to read the same thing as someone else. Other then likes and dislikes is the problem of the offensive. Everyone finds something offensive. Just because you find something that speaks to a bold statement doesn't mean you have to persecute someone who cares about the topic. Because the question of protecting children from something they shouldn't read yet is simple. Libraries often have sections dedicated to children where children @ MONTH1 choose the appropriate material for their age group. More often than not, I like to read what I like more than something that is forced. Censorship takes away the pleasure of reading. By not having censorship, everyone will be happy to be able to read what they like. It also allows a variety of books for a variety of people.

The author writes about removing books that adults don't want the book to be the end for which they won't have a book. They take out books that contain rude words or pictures. Well, I don't really think they should take them out because they're interesting to some of them. Well I'm not a fan of reading, I don't really like to read, but I have to do it anyway and I don't think it should come out. I don't really think it should be removed for some reasons, it is better to have them so that children can read and learn the pictures. Some books are not that bad for kids as they are for elementary school kids, the only books they like are those with pictures. The @ CAPS1 school and college kids love the kind of chapter book and interesting book. Parents would like them to have educational books that will help children learn new words and school related stuff. The books that adults want are the kind who like to have a lot of knowledge and school related stuff. They want children to learn what they read. But yeah I don't think they should take the bbok they have off they should just leave them for the kids because at least they are educational for them. Thus, the adult would have more students to lean on

I don't think materials like books, music, movies, and magazines should be taken off the shelves if they are found to be offensive. I think this is because people have different views and opinions on certain types of things, with region, culture and sexuality. Some people can be defended by this, but others can be informed and learn new facts that they did not already know. People will not see it the same way. Everyone has their own way of life and thinks differently. If a person felt the book was offensive to them, they would remove it from the shelves. One by one people would find other offensive material and what does that leave us with. More books, music, movies and magazines. Let's face it, everyone has different goals, values, and goals, but taking material off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridiculous to me. I'm saying if they find it offensive, don't re-read the book or the magazine. Feel offensive for a movie, don't watch it again and in the same way as music, don't listen to it again. Easy like that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines, we wouldn't be as smart as @ CAPS1. American is being free and having the right to say what you think. So putting materials off the shelves is not the answer

Yes, we should keep books, music, movies, and magazines. Magazines and music may not be a good thing for some of us as people have to use music to discuss work and magazines help us come up with topics for class work. why would anyone take books or anything that helps us in life, then the person who wants to take a book should live the books or whatever from them alone. So for this yes, we should keep books, music, movies, magazines on the shelves. We have to start fighting for what we want and as we want it shouldn't be known to decide what is good for us.

I believe that books, magazines, music, movies, etc. should be removed from a shelf if a person wants to read the book or magazine. If someone else wants to read the book or magazine, they will just have to wait until the book or magazine is put back on the shelf. If another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie, they should do the same as well. Sometimes you just have to sit down and think about what books, magazines, movies, music, etc. are for, and why are they on the shelves if you can't read, listen to, or watch them. The book and the magazine should be read and not just sit and display. Music should be listened to and movies should be watched. The reason I agree that magazines and books should be taken off the shelves is because they were made for your entertainment. A book or magazine is also designed to grab the reader's attention. Another reason I think books or magazines should be taken off a shelf is to learn new things. An example of learning new things is when you go to school you take the class book, you learn different things like math, you learn history or you learn different things in English class. . Magazines and books were created so that different people could pull them off a shelf and look at them even though they only want to look at a picture if it has a picture. The reason I think music should come off the shelves is to listen to different music such as rap, @ CAPS1 & @ CAPS2, gospel or @ CAPS1 & @ CAPS2 and soul. Also, I think the music should be taken off the shelf because it was meant to be heard. Certain music can teach you what is going on in a person's life or what is going on in their head. Music can inspire people in different ways. Music is a part of life and most of the people in the world like to listen to it different people who inspire them. The reason I think movies should be taken off the shelves is that they are meant to be watched and not just to sit back and let the cover of the movie entertain people. Movies can also inspire different people to do different things, such as becoming an actor as well. The films tell different stories such as life stories. Movies also give people something to do when they are bored. Finally, remove the movies, magazines, books and music, but put them back so that other people can enjoy what you have read, watched or listened to. Watching movies, listening to music, and reading magazines and books can help people in life and @ MONTH1 also inspire people. They were made for very good reasons, so don't put them on just to be displayed. Take them and use them for good you want to regret in the long run. You will be surprised at the different things you can learn from reading, listening and watching.

Different from everyone @ CAPS1 Do people find the little things offensive? My opinion is that everyone has their own idea of what may be offensive to them. There are so many little things that can be offensive like books, movies, and music. It's not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf, you might think it's offensive. I find it a bit rude to discriminate against someone for their belonging. Books can be a way to learn new things about someone. I think sometimes books can tell you more than a person in their own words can. There are so many books that they can be a little offensive to people and even to children. I know a parent wouldn't love to have a book on the shelf about '@ CAPS2', when they get @ CAPS2. It's definitely not a good thing to read, but parents really think about it. Don't you think we like kids need to know what @ CAPS2 really means? A book can tell us the right way or the wrong way, but we can learn from it and you don't even need to talk about. Movies are similar to books, in a way you can see what he's trying to teach everyone in action. I know some movies are awful just like @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. It's a horrible movie to watch but we really need to know what really happened to people. And even if a teacher says you have to see it with your own eyes to believe it. A great way to watch the film and learn from it. Music has many ways of being offensive to people, but singers are their way of expressing their own feelings about things. There are so many singers like @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 they use a lot of swear words in his song but this is how he conveys his own feelings to others. Even if the song is offensive to you, it is more their opinion, just as we all have a different opinion from others. My take on feeling offensive is that we are all different and have an opinion about it and we have to respect it. Especially if I wanted to learn new things and someone doesn't want to tell me or show me that I would like a book or a movie to learn. And parents just because I read a book, or watch a movie, or listen to music about bad things, don't assume that I'm going to do those things that I just want to learn about it. I wouldn't want someone to pick up a book from a shelf, especially if I want to read it. Remember this is your own take on the book, not everyone is different from you

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. The peculiarities of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of information on the places to go and the lack of water. This was a problem as he needed water for his trip and directions had to follow.   

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in a negative way. He was in the desert, which is dry and hot. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). Also, the temperature was hot and made everything hot around it, “the brackish water faling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees "(Kurmaskie @ NUM1). Since he was in the desert there was no escape from the sun. The text reads:" The sun was starting to hit "(Kurmaskie @ NUM3). The cyclist was all alone on the road with no one around him either, so he passed out, no one could help him. "and the growing awareness that I might fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day" (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). “About forty miles off the pedal I came to the first 'town' but that morning it met the traditional definition of a ghost town.” (Kurmaskie @ NUM3). The settings in which the cyclist was riding were not good and therefore affected him negatively ; causing him to be dehydrated and tired at the end.

Everyone travels to unfamiliar places. Sometimes we get lost and ask locals for directions which @ MONTH1 is not a good idea. The frame affected the cyclist. He had a perfectly good card but asked older men who seem like they haven't been out in ages. The old men apparently did not get out because they gave the cyclist the wrong direction. My advice would be to not listen to anyone, regardless of their age, if you have a really good card with you. Also try to know where you are going at all times. "Yes sir!        

<START>

 

I believe the rider's characteristics affected him because he was impatient and trustworthy, he took the old man's advice to take an hour of his time taking a little cat, if he stayed true to the mep He wouldn't be almost in heat but his impatience got the better of him so he took the shortcut. After his experience, he has new statistics ?? to the deputy and not trusting people who have not seen changes in recent years.   

<START>

 

The frame affects the rider because the frame was different, the story wouldn't make sense. The frame of the story is not dry with ghost towns scattered around. When he reaches the first "town", he sees "A dilapidated one loses several rusty pumps and a coral which cannot contain the lame mule". If the scenery had the problem of no water, then there would be no conflict in the story, "In the story the speaker says ' I was traveling through the high deserts of California ' which are very hot and dry, and he said " This causes the problem being that it is hot and dry if the scenery was a forest at @ DATE1, it wouldn't have as much of a problem needing water, which would make it much less exciting story.      

<START>

 

Many features of the frame affected the rider. For example, it was extremely hot and dry. Moreover, it was almost deserted, almost all the places it passed through were deserted. Its set features were a ram shackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that didn't stop with the slightest movement. an idea of how the cyclist feels.         

<START>

 

The cyclist was crossing a tower when he stopped to ask for directions. These old men told him to take a shortcut and he did and got lost. He was in a ghost town in the desert. In conclusion, the desert is hot.

The effects of the cyclist is if he does not change. it hurt a lot of people because they @ CAPS1 don't care about the rider. I'm one of those people who doesn't care because it doesn't affect me or anyone I know. It's a big deal to write to people, some of them @ CAPS1 are blowing stuff up. They talk on TV and on the radio doing whatever they say is made up. I don't think I see it. This @ CAPS1 is not for black people because it didn't do anything to us. We really don't care about the effects of the cyclist.

The essay " Rough Road Ahead : Staying Within The Posted Speed Limit " describes a man's bike ride through California. Now California is very hot during the summer which is when the cyclist is riding. This parameter greatly affects human travel. It was very difficult for him to finish his race. He drank most of his water at the start of his ride, so he's very dehydrated. The text reads: “The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. " As you can see, the framework makes the bike ride of this man very difficult.          

<START>

 

In the story, “Rough Road Ahead: Staying Within the Posted Speed Limit” written by Joe Kurmaskie, depicts how certain conditions can affect a rider. The cyclist was cycling through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but during his trip he encountered many difficult conditions that made it difficult to access. First of all, the desert was very hot which made getting around very difficult. For example, the text states: “ The sun was beginning to strike. ” @ CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drains energy from a person. Second, the ride was very long and therefore the rider struggled to save water. For example, man drank so much water that he almost ran out; “The water bottle only contained dehydration which can lead to death. Joe Kurmaskie's story, “Rough Road Ahead. Staying Within the Posted Speed Limit,” depicts how certain environmental conditions can affect a rider.

Authors' “shortcut” setting greatly affected its performance and strength. whether it's the hills, the heat or the barren landscape, all three have taken their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water also drained his energy. The flat road was replaced by short hills. The hills were a difficult thing to cross since Joe was drained of his energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building appeared. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too aroused with what I thought was my last burst of energy. I maneuvered down the hill. The author overcame all the problems encountered even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this article to exaggerate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston Churchill once said: “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to keep going that counts. I think @ PERSON2 agrees.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider! The cyclist crosses the hot desert. This means that he needs a lot of cold water to stay hydrated. The longer he rides in the hot sun, the more he sweats, the more likely he is to become dehydrated. If he was riding in the rain or snow, it might slow him down as well, as he would be cold and his muscles might get stiff and not be able to move as fast. This is why the setting affects the rider a lot.     

<START>

 

Many characteristics affected the rider, such as heat and lack of water. The cyclist drank a lot of water throughout the story and ended up having little water left. "I calmed down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." This shows that he was not prepared with enough water for his trip to Yosemite. Without water, he would die of heat. “Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt, and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke.” This indicates that he @ CAPS1 is in danger of not having enough water in his system. Features like water and heat affected him throughout Not having enough water could cause him to lose more sweat and the heat causes him to lose even more sweat which can cause heat stroke. extreme.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. Initially, when the cyclist crossed the road with the big snake in the middle, he was very worried and very uncomfortable. In addition, the desert and nothing around gave the cyclist abandonment and no help when he is in difficulty. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait shop and people are there. The characteristics of the environment greatly affected the cyclist during his journey.

The characteristics of the decorative " Rough Road Ahead : Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit " Joe Kurmaksie greatly affect the rider and made it through many trials he would probably have been avoided. The former cotagers told him about a path they thought was right, but was difficult and did not lead him to the right place. The features of the setting are described as " the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills ".      

<START>

 

In the essay Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit, author Joe Kurmaskie uses the characteristics of the frame to affect the rider. The cyclist is affected by these characteristics because he sees the same scenery (the dessert) for several kilometers, he has no water and the road has a lot of hills. The rider might be affected by seeing dessert and no change of scenery for a wahile. When you watch the same scene for hours on end, you can start to tire and get bored with everything. So that makes it very dirty and bored. Also, the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains were cold water. Not having water in the dessert could make you dehydrated and may pass out.

Many different characteristics in a setting and determine the outcome of an event there. In the story, Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed the posted speed limit, the route of cyclists has been affected by some weather events. The heat was an extreme thing that showed him down and in most cases kept him from reading his maximum capacity level. In addition, the time you are in this place greatly affects the rider. Finally, the type of road and the amount of terrain it has to cover afterwards affects its performance. Overall, the setting can be a determining factor in a journey through the lifespan.

The setting of the story affects the rider in several ways. Since riding in the California desert, he's always been very hot and always thirsty. On top of that, the area it rides in seems to be pretty desolate. He only finds old abandoned buildings. He can't find anyone. No people or cars or any sign of modern civilization. It makes him a little pissed off, as if something is happening to him no one will know. This is especially common when it becomes dehydrated. In this way, the rider is very affected by the frame.        

<START>

 

In @ PERSON1's “ Rough Road Ahead ” story, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. One way the setting affects the rider is, in the wilderness, the rider drank more water than before. For example, the text reads " I knocked my water bottles quite regularly and traveled to the high deserts of California in June." You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest. If you are riding a bike, be aware of the parameters around you as they will affect you.       

<START>

 

Certain characteristics of the frame affect the rider. First off, the rider took old advice from codgers to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was of no use and ultimately did not help her. Then "a tar-like substance oozed out" from what was to be water. Then the terrain turned into “ short rolling hills ” which didn't help, his bike got better. Finally, "weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake," slowed her down. All these roadblocks in the background affected the cyclist.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame that affect the cyclist are lack of water, outdated information and hills. If he had up-to-date information he probably would have gotten water from a town that is not empty or nearly empty like a "ghost town" as the cyclist put it.

The rider has some problems if he is running and the wind is blowing then there is a problem and he has to follow the rules of the road and ride on the right side or on the road.

“Don't exceed posted speed limit” had a rough set between dangerous things and death-defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination. He had been given the wrong directions which almost killed him. He was traveling in a desert and claimed the temperature was @ NUM1. In addition, the cyclist had to ration his water because these were ghost towns that our character was passing through. He used the nature skills he once learned and started sucking pebbles that keep the spirit away from thirst and uses the saliva to cool your throat. Throughout his adventure, everything prevented this young man from fetching water and going faster each time there was water. He had survived and would never take shortcuts again        

<START>

 

An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the water lock in a ghost town just in Eliterat. He fried the water but a tar-like substance came out and it tasted like a battery. When he left he had to cross a rough road which he could not cover so quickly due to the condition of the road.  

<START>

 

The cyclist had a hard time getting to Yosemite National Park. It was because the sun was there, and it was mid-June. I was so hot the rider dehydrated faster than he would on a cooler day. When he pumped the handle of the old rusty water pump, he said the water felt "somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees." The rider also had to deal with a lot of "short hills" which was much more difficult to cover than flat roads. On top of everything else, the roads were in very poor condition so you had to watch out for pebbles on the road.     

<START>

 

The cyclist in the story is initially confident in accepting help from the elderly and doesn't seem to suspect that something is wrong when he first starts. The way the men have run it seems to go for its water supply is all in store, and the first dirt mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it's supposed to be. The next "town" he reaches has nothing to replenish his dwindling water supply and he begins to feel troubled. However, he was told that the next town was not further away, so he continued. Then the scenery changes drastically, the flat roads turn into hills, the sun beats hotter and hotter - it really looks like a desert even after the tumbleweeds have passed ! The cyclist continues despite his severe dehydration. Next thing to come is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him out for having no water. He continues however and finally sees a store where he can get water. The changing landscape shifts the cyclist from confidence to worry, despair and finally relief.

Well I would say it's time has everything to do with it because bad weather makes you tired and upset and easy to anger so now it makes you upset and then stressed out.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in two ways. These paths are physical and mental. The physical way in which the characteristics affect the rider is the terrain. If the roads are long and winding, it could tire the cyclist. They could also become physically tired if the slope of the hill is too steep. When it's you against gravity, it can be exhausting. Temperature can also be a crucial factor in a cyclist's physical ability. No one wants to feel like they are in a sauna when riding a bike. The cyclist and also be mentally attracted. If the terrain looks deserted or something that looks like a desert, the rider instinctively thinks “ dehydration ” and “ dead ”. If some people saw dead animals or bones, they would think they might die. If they saw a vulture surrounding them, they would be afraid and think about death, but the worst part is knowing that all of these things are in one place at the same time. Here's how the tuning affects riders                

<START>

 

The sets of the story were breathtaking. As the cyclist rode, the sun was starting to hit him. The cyclist started to sweat from the heat and therefore drank most of his water. Now the cyclist was suffering from severe heat, sweat and dehydration. The California desert is a great place to live, especially in June. Fortunately, the cyclist arrived at a camp and found some fresh food and water, before finally continuing on his way to Yosemite National Park.     

<START>

 

As the cyclist travels to Yosemite National Park, he encounters many features of the area that affect him. First, he takes instructions from old guys who don't know a thing about changing cards because they never leave their porch. At first this affects him in a positive way, as he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, the effect turned negative later as it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed. Another characteristic that affected him was spoiling the decor which looked like a desert area. The heat prevented him from cycling and he also drank a lot of water. This then led to him becoming dehydrated. One positive effect was when he found the bait shop, where he rehydrated and got new directions.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of this setting affect the rider in several ways. The setting is a dessert so common knowledge you know it's going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot, the cyclist needs more water as he becomes dehydrated. And when it runs out of water because it is dry, the mouth becomes dry. @ CAPS2 because he is in the dessert, he sees sometimes dangerous wild animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously snake @ CAPS1 Diamondbrock, which I believe to be poisonous, @ CAPS2 "because" of the extreme heat of the dessert , he realizes that he had ??? risk of falling due to heat stroke. @ CAPS2 the writer said the dessert has short hills and a rough road ??? would leave the cyclist exhausted. Due to this terrain, the path of the cyclist affects.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in different ways. One example is that the scorching sun hitting him made him very thirsty. Another feature is the rough road which has worn down the rider and made him tired. My final example is the old juice factory with the image of a refreshing cup of juice that made the rider feel like they were giving up because they thought they would die of dehydration. These are my reasons why the characteristics of the frame affect the rider in different ways.

Understanding, realistic, mode-all is how the frame affects the frame. If a book has a good frame, then the book can be good enough. When you have a setting, what they're trying today is more understandable. And if you have a good frame, that makes it more realistic. So when you read it you won't be discouraged, story mode kicks it all off, because books usually have their ups and downs. This is why they are chasing fashion.

The setting of the story affected the rider by making him dehydrated which could lead to heatstroke. "I could fall from heat stroke" shows that it was hot and that he felt bad if he could have fallen from heat stroke. 

<START>

 

The terrain during the cyclist's journey affects it greatly. For example, the first terrain he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and calming. The author said: "I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face." It shows that he was full of energy and happy. However, the reader can predict that the trip will not remain so joyful, as the rider is essentially in the desert during the summer, where it is extremely hot. Next, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that has sucked life out of his body, especially because he ran out of water. The cyclist said: "Sometimes life can seem so cruel", pointing out that the cyclist's mood has gone from enthusiastic to tired and desperate. This change in the mood of the terrain can be related to real life, as obstacles are included, in which the person has to persevere and be strong to overcome, which the cyclist ultimately did.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the story have a great effect on the cyclist. One feature of the setting that affects the rider is heat. At first, the story says that the pines made the cyclist cool, but eventually the forest turned into a desert and the heat that fell on him made it difficult for him to cycle. Another feature that affected the rider was the lack of water. As he moved away from his starting point, the cyclist drank a lot of water. But when he needed to refuel, the water was brown and warm, so the rider didn't take any. The lack of water and the heat formed a giant obstacle that could have killed him, but thanks to great determination the cyclist got through this unsettling time.

The narrator of this story goes through a difficult journey emphasizing hope, the challenge of physical pain, despair and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings in which they take place. For example, after taking advice from old people on a campsite, he headed for the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his trip could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or been in a place where towns weren't several miles apart. Also, at one point, he hits a snake on the road. It could symbolize a decision, who had to go and how that would affect the outcome of his trip, or maybe the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet, he should use it. The irony continues as he dehydrates and the flat terrain becomes hilly. If that hadn't happened, he might have been more successful and healthier on his trip. The setting of this story of men is necessary to have an intrigue and to have the humor that it possesses. If he was in town, for example, he wouldn't get lost and stuck, so he wouldn't have a story.          

<START>

 

The frame of the story changes several times. It starts in an area with rivers and pine trees. Then the cyclist arrives in a city. After that he is pounded by the scorching sun and along a hilly road. With little water left, the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink. The setting was what made it difficult for cyclists to travel.

The characteristics of the parameters affect in the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit", it is morning and everyone is still asleep and he wakes up in the morning for something to do when he goes to the first place , he thinks they're all old and crazy, and he thinks the place needs fixing because the houses are collapsing. Then go and see those wide piles of hills. inconclusion, I would never do all the riding he did.   

<START>

 

The scenery affects the cyclist as he is in the desert without water and does not know where he is going. The old men on the porch have given him wrong directions now that he's lost in the desert. The cyclist finds the will to keep moving forward and finds help along the way. There he finds another old man who offers him directions but he says he has a map   

<START>

 

The setting of the story greatly discouraged the biker. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and begins his journey, he notices that there is " no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind ." He uses words to describe how things turned out when he says, "The water bottle only contained a few mouthwatering sips." He describes with exhaustion how difficult his journey becomes. He describes the intense heat of the Californian desert while pedaling, "a long crippling hill". The terrain did not make it easy to drive at all. The weather factor, the rolling hills and the lack of water weigh it down heavily. If he had been on level ground on a cool day, he would have been the first good.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. The scorching sun that hits him makes him sweat and make him thirsty. Bumpy roads and hills make him work harder. The abandoned places make him lose hope. If I had been confronted with these obstacles, I would have been affected in the same way. As I believe any human would be.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. The characteristics of the frame, or of nature, affect the rider because they exhaust him. The cyclist goes to Yosemite town but some guys gave her a shortcut. Across this shortcut are the hills and the heat and lack of water. @ CAPS1 describes it by saying, "I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited." @ CAPS1 is glad that there is a building in which @ CAPS1 could get water. Also, @ CAPS1 has wiped the sweat from his eyes which means it's hot outside and @ CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. Therefore, the characteristics of the setting affect the rider.      

<START>

 

The three most important characteristics of the setting that affect the rider are the terrain they travel, the towns they pass through, and the availability of water. The ground on which the cyclist rides is important because the rougher the terrain and the more hills there are, the more energy he has to use and the less distance he can cover. @ PERSON1 rides well until he has to roam the hills which consume his energy, depletes his water and divides hope. As he nears the cities, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the city will be unable to bring him relief. When he pumps water that tastes like "battery acid," his hope again diminishes. Seeing the bait and fishing tackle store, he knows he can get there and when he gets there he can recover. These three characteristics are the ones that affect the rider the most.

In the story of "bumpy road ahead: do not exceed posted limit", the setting affected the rider. In the middle of the desert during the summer, the cyclist was running out of water. The old men gave him the wrong directions, so it was mostly the old people who thought he was dying. The rider survives but the heat and the season he was riding he will probably bring another bottle of water next time

Some of the characteristics of the frame affect the rider, as the road was bad, there were bumps all over which made it a lot harder and it also took a lot of force. Also the two hundred degree neighborhood after that becomes a road with a bunch of hills

In the story, many different parameters have affected the author in different ways. At the very beginning of his journey, he stumbled upon a ghost town. He reacted to the characteristics of this setting with humor and hope. “ I laughed, checked my water supply and continued. He still hopes he ends up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a pitchfork in the horse. He grew worried when he saw that no nearby city was yet in sight. "This sight was disturbing" when the features of the following scenery caught his attention, he was desperate and devastated. “At one point grass crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @ CAPS1 factory, all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. "I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean." @ CAPS2, when he reached the fishing camp he was relieved "I had an overwhelming urge to look for Gary and Wilber, kiss them and buy some bait."

Ghost towns aren't exactly the most inviting place for a cyclist with a lack of water supply. In "Bumpy Road: Do not exceed the speed limit", the cyclist is affected in several ways by his surroundings. Starting a hot day with bright sunshine starts off as a good thing, with her mood still chilly and cheerful expressions playing on her face. But as he advances, he recounts how "the sun was beginning to beat" expressing his remorse for having listened to the old men who led him on their "shortcut". Along the way, he arrives at his first disappointment, a ghost town with "a dilapidated store, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the dullest of bucks." @ CAPS1 he tries to pump water from the corral but gets a "battery acid" flavor and is forced to continue with little to drink. It affects his mood for feeling sorry for himself and getting angry with the men who put him in this situation. In the end, however, he is relieved when he comes to GARY & @ CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he "had an overwhelming urge to search @ ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait". His gratitude goes to men he doesn't even know but because they were the light at the end of his long dark and very exhausting tunnel.

The tuning characteristics affect the rider. It was hard to happen to the first city for the author. For example, “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ”. The road the author was traveling was rough. The @ CAPS1 example is " A flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills ". The whole road was rough and rugged. That "The water bottle only contained a few invigorating sips." @ CAPS1 does not have a lot of water. It was really hard.

The characteristics of the sale greatly affect the cyclist. One factor that would affect the rider would be heat. In addition, because of this factor, he is probably suffering from a lack of water. He's probably very sexy because he's the only one cut in the middle of nowhere for what feels like miles. Another feature of the tuning that would likely affect the rider is the thought that there will be @ MONTH1 a car around this next turn. If he can't see around the next corner, he doesn't know he's coming. The cyclist might also be thinking about when the next city will appear.

The frame puts a lot of stress on the rider. The biggest problem he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist "traveling through the high deserts of @ LOCATION1 in June". He had been biking all day and was going to run out of water soon. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank "smelling water somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees." The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the rider was the terrain. " The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills " is the main problem the cyclist faced. These changes of terrain played in the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills forced the cyclist to work harder, thus using more energy. Fortunately, the terrain also had a positive effect on the rider. The stones he found on the ground helped keep his mind away from thirst. Many factors of the setting have negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure.

The narration of “Rough Road Ahead” a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story. Changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his trip and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite National Park from none of the old men, his first encounter with his surroundings recognizes its merit and need for water. The text reads " I had sheltered my water quite regularly ... the high deserts of California in June ". Disappointed, the supply of water to the roadhouse from the pumps was not sufficient for his consumption, only forcing him to connect elsewhere to quench his thirst then, he depleted the hills by exerting more energy, he on its way now everyone still needs water. His spending lost its speed as thoughts of his crippling dehydration distracted him. He had come his challenges making his was in a bate store as the heat beat him mercilessly. The change in his surroundings put his health to the test and created an obstruction that almost deterred him from his goal.

The frame affected the rider a lot. One way was heat. It was so hot he was starting to get dehydrated. He continued to drink his water, until he ran out of it. Another reason is that the road turned into hills, which forced it to use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he didn't see any signs of living creatures except for a snake @ CAPS1 how the frame affected the rider.

The characteristics of the parameter " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " affect the main character of the cyclist. The cyclist is cycling "through the high desert of California in June". So naturally it can be hellish that it isn't and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist passes through a ghost town and a pump that releases "a tar-like substance followed by brackish water", he lacks his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills, tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist has the impression that " I fell from heatstroke on a beautiful day in June ". He discovers that an old grape juice factory is no longer in operation, causing more anxiety and disparity. I was frozen over and a desolate landscape of snow-covered trees made me think I would never be warm again, like a cyclist whose surroundings made him feel like he had died of dehydration. So, as we can see. The staging of this news affects the cyclist.

The settings that affected the rider were actually the ones you don't want to be near when you're out of the water and tired of pedaling. The weather and location affected it a lot as there was no cool breeze in the air in June in California. He was in the middle of flat deserts and had no idea where to party and where civilization too so he could get water. The quote “ old people who haven't left the confines of their front porch since Carter was in power ” has helped you realize that taking advice from old people who are not going anywhere is a bad idea. " The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills ." This quote shows you some characteristics of the terrail that affected the rider.

In the story “Don't Exceed the Posted Speed Limit,” author Joe Kurmaskie tells you that there are a lot of things you have to go through before you get there. The example is when "he stops and asks for directions for Yosemite State Park".

I think the frame characteristics that affected the rider were the terrain "The flat road has been replaced by short hills" this shows he is warm and unsettled by the change in terrain. He also falls alone. Even though he was in a ghost town. " Summer time " was shaking in the dry honeycombs of my detouring brain, "he felt he was slowly dying. See a mirage. But through all he had hoped for, the author also wants may we have hope and keep going even when things don't look good, keep moving forward, never look back and always be positive and enjoy your surroundings.

Heat, dry, flat - all are characteristics of the environment that affected the rider. As the cyclist drove through the desert he noticed how hot it was and how quickly he would become dehydrated. I was also very dry and he started to get nervous about his thirst. The flat terrain shows how there is nothing around that could help the rider, which scared him. The story also mentions that it is a ghost town

The characteristics of the setting affect the cyclist by the way the author started to speak and the way he sounds at the beginning of the story. When they both look at the photo, he seems to sing cecilla, then ceo. For the story and goo continue the links reads.

In the story “ Don't exceed the posted speed limit ” by Joe Kurmaskie, there was a lot that affected the rider. Like water. He didn't really have good water to drink because of where he was. '' When I tried a drop or two, it tasted like battery acid. '' He could not drink the water because the acid from the battery in it could have made him very sick. In addition, the unstable roads he had to take made things difficult. '' Bumpy roads ahead '' Riding on unstable ground can be very difficult to do. So just these two examples, the water and rough roads made the frame characteristics have a decisive effect on the rider.

In the 'Rough Road Ahead' test Do not exceed the posted speed if many characteristics of the frame affect the rider. At the beginning, the cyclist passes by the river which he will find again later in the journey. As he moves forward, the heat and lack of water begin to affect him. He also finds a water fountain that pours hot water with the flavor that has been closed for a long time. The rider is affected by many characteristics of the frame.

The tuning characteristic affects the rider because the roads are too rough. If it goes too hard it could break down and the water was a problem. He sadly said " when I tried a deep or two it tasted like battery acid."

The cyclist is especially affected by his lack of water. At the start of his race the cyclist is confident and strives to achieve the joys of @ LOCATION1. He longs for " cool pines and rushing rivers ... " (@ NUM1). Later, when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain, he begins to feel exhausted as he depletes his water supply. A little relief comes to him later after a long climb up a hill until he sees a closed juice factory, almost appearing to have been put there to tease him. His destination filled him with relief and pride, knowing he would survive the arduous journey.

The arrangement effected the cyclist in a big way. Snakes were blocking his tracks, and the lack of water made his pursuit difficult. He felt like he could fall from heatstroke. His surroundings and the old man's information made his ride very difficult to continue. Overall, his settings had a big effect on him.

The cyclist was well prepared for his adventure but warm enough for a change of senator. When the old men told him to take a difficult path and his tire setting changed for the worse. After that he was almost supercharged by devastating hills and dehydration slowly took hold of him as well. He had hardly packed enough water or supplies for a change like this and he would regret it later. The hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and mankind merciful it was even worse for him. This is how the change in setting affected the rider.      

<START>

 

The setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case it was a cyclist. As it was June, it turned out that the weather was bad outside causing the rider to lose more body fluid due to his constant, sweat-producing movements. This makes water a staple. Also, as he passes by, he comes across a sign that says: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD : DO NOT EXCEED POSTÉ @ CAPS1. As the road was more difficult to drive, crossing it on a bicycle is not much easier. Another way the frame affected the rider was the road blocking serpent, which he viewed as a diamond back.       

<START>

 

The fit characteristics really affect the rider due to the condition. For example, the weather is hot, it will slow down the person. And if it's perfect it will allow the person to go at normal speed. And the roads, if the road is bumpy, it will slow them down. And if it's smooth, it will speed them up. You see, it really depends on the state.

The setting greatly affects the author. It is first found in a California desert in mid-June. It is very hot outside. This makes the cyclist very tired. There are a few cool pins, but they help a lot. There is also no place to find water for very long. The narration states, "I calmed down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state" (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). for most of the story. The rider didn't know how far to go until he hit @ CAPS1 or water. There was also no one to help him if he had to have heatstroke.

In the story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the characteristics of the setting affected the rider. For example, the cyclist cycled for miles with the weather in the deserts, a little water and fatigue. The cyclist had to face many difficulties while trying to move from one point to another on his bicycle.    

<START>

 

The setting of this story greatly affects the attitude and adversity of the cyclist. The cyclist's path crosses the Californian deserts, dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict in the story, the danger of the cyclist getting a heatstake. In the reading, the author says, “I knocked my water bottles fairly regularly.” If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author probably wouldn't drink as often and would not be dehydrated. The ride would not have been so dangerous for the cyclist if the climate had been different. Another element of the scenery that affected the rider was the terrain. In the reading it is written: “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills. " The rugged road not only put a strain on the body of the author, but also its spirit. While driving, the author thinks: “I was racing at 20 km / h exhausting the water. Thinking about his thirst would only increase his thirst. The small change in terrain had a big impact on the authors' journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. It is only until the end of the story that the cyclist meets another human. Until this point, he was on his own, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the frame had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have had help from other people, which would have made his race very easy. Also known that no one was going to help him played a big role in the author's mental state. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting hadn't been hot, harsh, and secluded, the rider would have had an easy trip, and the story wouldn't have been so exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. When the cyclist crossed the desert, he had to be dry, old, dirty “…. I came to some sort of pitchfork, a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the larger mule greeted me. This side was disturbing. “When she wanted us, the rusty water pump-like substance seeped out and the water appeared to be NUM1 degrees. “Less than three kilometers from this next section of the course, I notice that the terrain is changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. “ It made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride a bike. This would tire the cyclist more. As the cyclist advanced, he became more and more tired and his water supply diminished. It was trying to keep my balance as he continued to roll

How the setting of the place affects the rider is that one dries up, a rider would be ridiculous as he should not be in a dry place. "which means it was really hot and dry. Second, the animals there would be dangerous. A cyclist would have to ride in a place with diamond-backed snakes, it says in the text" I worked hard . skilt, he really looked like a diamond back "which, if he really had one, would be really dangerous and the rider should not ride in those type of dangerous places no matter what type. This is how environmental settings affect the rider and how bad is it for them to ride.

The characteristics of the setting affecting the rider by the ground would change the terrian a lot, making it difficult to ride at the same speed throughout the ride. In addition, the lack of water made it difficult to concentrate. I think the characteristics of the frame affect the rider because people think they are worse than they actually are.

The setting affects the rider in several ways. The setting affects the rider as the weather is very hot and humid causing them to sweat which consumes energy as their body tries to stay cool. In addition, the setting affects the rider as there is no water, so in addition to sweating and being low on energy, he has no water to refuel his body, which makes him makes it very difficult to continue.

In this story, the cyclist crosses a desert in California. This is one reason why there is very limited on the water supply. It is really hot, which would force him to drink a lot more water. He had started his journey in the morning so that the sun was not as hot as it was in the middle of the day. Then he started to get a lot more sonny. So with the sun comes more heat. The rider said, “The sun was starting to hit. It would help readers understand what time it was and how hot it was. It was morning, so he didn't realize it, but as the afternoon wore on he realized it and started to get dehydrated.

The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic effect on the author. The effect was bad rather than good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had a limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the sweltering temperatures. Another feature which had a great impact on the author's well-being is said to be the lack of water in the pumps which he accidentally stumbled upon while tasting. Finally, there would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when the perpetrator attempted to obtain water. There was also brackish water in it which tasted suspicious of battery acid.

The cyclist travels through a difficult part of California during the hot month of June. The author describes part of part of his journey; "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." The heat of the sun and the lack of water around make the cyclist worried about his health. A little further on in his journey, he realizes how badly he might feel if he doesn't find water quickly. The author writes: “the growing awareness that I might fall from heat stroke.” As the rider runs out of water and there is no sign of life around, he begins to smell that he @ MONTH1 will never cross the desert to Yosemite National Park. The author describes this: “I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean.” The setting of the cyclist's journey greatly affected the way he viewed his journey.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because of where it sits. The biker is at a campsite in California. By saying that you could feel that it is a dusty place. Also, when the story goes that the "city" had been abandoned. It also tells us that the rider's location is a deserted place without many people or places to stop. The story is also about a snake on the road. A snake on the road says the city is wanted I could say this “city” is deserted because here people don't go to cities that don't have buildings. There was a snake on the road, so the city must be empty because here the streets are busy and there are no snakes on the road.       

<START>

 

The frame greatly affects the rider as it is he who rides " short rolling hills " and around a " ridiculously large snake ", and because it is hot, he can suffer from heat stroke at any time. . So yes the author is concerned by the setting

The effects of the characteristics around them affect them by hot bikes, so the bikers need water and it also affects them by the roads are so rough that they cannot just ride. Stight so they have to get over the hills and it affects them as the cycles are very hard to land from a jump.

The characteristics of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something of impatience, but the characteristic of the sort he is using to make it desperate. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices the sweltering heat of the sun during the first attempts at the trip, he checks himself out by saying, " I did notice it [the sun], the cool pines and the steep hills of Yosemite had my name is written everywhere. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the journey and the sun would take on him, he cleared the morning with the hope and hope of arriving in Yosemite. The more the rider noticed the sun, the more he drank until his water supply seemed weak, scratching like an old rusty water pump that he hoped to be replenished, but the taste of bitter battery acid pushed on the cyclist to stop drinking. at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists had seen a sign for Yosemite at NUM1 miles his morale would have risen, instead he saw a sign for " Rough Road Ahead " which did nothing to help him. If the terrain were more poporsed, easier to tread on and in abundance of water supply, the air of this passive would be more hoped for that in such desperation the frame characteristics caused grief to the rider instead of 'to hope.

 The cyclist of the news " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " from @ PERSON1, is greatly affected by the state of the terrain around him. He crosses the extremely dry and short desert, running out of water. However, since it is such a dry place, he cannot find one.

In "rough road: do not exceed the posted speed limit, the characteristics of the setting affect the rider. Many visual characteristics create a very deserted area that makes your head hot. For example, in paragraph five, they use many adjectives to describe how abandon the place was. Words like run down and rusty. Plus, the frequency with which the lack of water was reported made us think about how hot this California desert must be. Plus, the heat was overwhelming. Makes the cyclist believe he was witnessing a miracle when he saw the fruit of the Welsh juice factory.The choice of visual words in this story are words to describe what affected the cyclist.

In the passage, the rider had about @ NUM1 different settings. One of those parameters was the rough terrain he had to cross where there was a lack of water. Another setting the rider had to go through was the hill-like terrains. first place. These two characteristics had a great weight on the strength of the rider's body and his mind. But with confidence, determination and the relief of success, he was able to overcome obstacles.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was also hot. The text says, "Somewhere around two hundred degrees. It affected him because he had no water to drink. Another example is when he had to defeat the tumbleweeds and snakes. Text says "tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake". It was an obstacle he had to overcome. Another example is that he was deserted. The text reads: “ No one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. "

The setting in the rider characteristics is that if it is too hot or too cold it could affect the way the rider rides. If it is too hot, the cyclist will burn out much more quickly. And if it's too cold, cyclist @ MONTH1 would get sick. Also, if there is too much wind, it will go much slower if it goes in the direction of the wind.

The characteristics that affected the rider were many. One thing would be the lack of water. In the text he said the pump gave out water that tasted like battery acid.

The frame and its characteristics greatly affect the rider. He is in the desert and all the cities are abandoned. Additionally, he's now hitting a sign that says “ Rough Road Ahead… (kurmaskie, pg @ NUM1).

The frame characteristics affect the rider giving him obstacles to overcome when he has to go down winding hills, he should slow down to be able to maneuver the hills and not lose control of the bike. The heat he faced would cause fatigue and dehydration. If you are exposed to the sun and heat for long enough, you can get sunburn or heatstroke. Heat stroke can be fatal to anyone, especially those with heart problems. Dehydration can also be fatal. If the cyclist does not see any building, he could not tell where he is and he could get lost because of it. Getting lost will also lead to dehydration, fatigue, and heat stroke.

The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but as he travels through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the desert. These buildings create a sense of succession in the cyclist and can be followed by the despair of finding them abandoned. The land without characteristics also creates a feeling of loss of hope in the cyclist, which makes his ordeal even more difficult.

In 'Rough @ CAPS1 Ahead', the characteristics of the rider's frame and environment greatly influence him. Because it is located in "the high deserts of California in June", the climate is hot, dry and miserable. Another feature of the scenery that affects the cyclist is that it is in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles.

In the short story, the rider was affected by the frame in several ways. The author was short of water throughout the story. "The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips." There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He must have traveled a long distance. "Not two miles in the next section." He got tired quickly. In addition, the terrain was not good. "I noticed the terrain was changing, the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills." It becomes more and more difficult to continue his ride.

The cyclist was so determined to see pines and cool lakes, that when he saw dirt, a snake and no source of civilization worried him. More emotionally, what he didn't see frightened him the most. He saw windy rivers or trails hidden under all kinds of trees. He didn't see anyone or any nice little forest creatures. Instead, he just saw the same color of rusty dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he began to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and doubted for a moment if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the dilapidated Welch factory building, he was even more upset. Fortunately, he found civilization when he came to a fishing supply store. It definitely boosted his morale. Once he had saved his thirst problem and made sure he was alive and hopefully would stay, he sat down before setting off again in search of his destination.

The characteristics of the frame are not very good for the rider. It's in California in June, and it's very hot. It's pretty much a desert. When he stops to take water, the pump he finds has no more water except for a few drops. Plus, the few drops he gets tasted like battery acid. It is therefore not very good for the cyclist.

In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the author changes the mood by telling us not only what the cyclist feels, but also by describing his surroundings. As he leaves the "reservoir compground" he feels pretty good because he has just left "the serenity of an early summer evening and heads for" The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite ". It is in a beautiful setting and this affects the rider as he anticipates another. However, when he moves to the" ghost town "and" the sun starts to hit "he is less confident and becomes more dubious. as to men's advice. However, he's still optimistic, ultimately it's funny that it used to be “a little flourishing place.” Then, when the rider comes to “a dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a coral”, he know that things are bad and @ CAPS1 water. However, all that he is a "tar-like substance", then move on, not having a choice. When he comes to " rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously big snake ", this affects the rider in letting him know that things are going for the worst and that he can either give up or keep moving forward. I doubt it could get any worse, and so will the cyclist. Finally at the end the cyclists enter a rather modern bathroom ”and things return to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better.

There are @ NUM1 characteristics of the setting that affect the rider on his ride. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and there is no one. Due to the lack of water, this characteristic really affects the rider. He will need water in all to move and complete his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up dehydrating and causing him to die in the middle of the street. Therefore, water is a characteristic that affects the rider. Plus, he's in the middle of nowhere. There are no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations, so where he can stop and if he had money he could buy around @ NUM2 or @ NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks.

Settings affect riders for a number of reasons.

The setting of the story affected the cyclist by going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The rider was also running low on water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty card.

In the text, the characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. For example, the text says, “There was no one in sight, not a building or structure of any kind. This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Second, the text read, “ In an ironic twist, the building was abandoned years more easily, judging by its appearance - it was a Welch grape juice factory. This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people inside and he got excited. Finally, the text reads: “ @ CAPS1 GRAPE AND FISH CAMP ” The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness to find a place to have a drink. The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the feelings of the rider.

The characteristics of the frame made the rider's run longer and more difficult than expected. When the rider first rode the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his journey, the “ flat road was replaced by short rolling hills ”. The rider continues to pedal even though he has been slowed to 12 mph. The hills made the journey slower and more difficult because of the hills. At the end of the hills, he must have done it " on a long and crippling hill ". The word "crippling" is used to show the physical effect the hill had on him. Hills were a feature of the setting that made the rider's ride longer, more difficult, and more physically demanding.

There are many features in the frame that affect the rider. For example the rough road. Another example is tumble weed and the snake affected the rider as well. In conclusion, these are the reasons why the tuning affects the rider.

The sun, the number of kilometers, the people are all reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun hit him every time and the cyclist seemed to be complaining that it was so hot. Also, he said he really didn't seem to notice in his mind that it was affecting the rider. Then the number of kilometers traveled by the cyclist affected him mentally because people kept,

The setting is like a desert without water or civilizations around it. This makes him more worried because if he dies, it will probably be known for days or weeks.

There are several characteristics that the rider has encountered, and all of them have affected the rider. For example, "several rusty bumps" is a quote from the text explaining that it did not roll on smooth ground, but on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also, he was extremely lacking in water, he was running out of water, he couldn't even exceed the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have gone 55 mph. “ Bumpy Roads Ahead Do not exceed the posted speed limit ,” is another quote expressing the dangers of the race he was risking. All of these things made the rider uncomfortable, dehydrated and very tired.        

<START>

 

The setting for "Rough Road Ahead: Not Exceeding the Posted Speed Limit" was a very important factor in the story which was in fact the root cause of the protagonist's problem throughout. First of all, he started with the big hills he had to climb, which required him to work harder and tire quickly. Then the big deal was the June heat, "and the growing awareness that I could have heatstroke on a beautiful June day simply because" the heat was so bad because it got it. It was hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and this gave the almost inevitable great risk of heatstroke and death. The heat also made the abandoned juice factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. "A shortbread photo of a young boy pouring a glass of refreshing juice into his mouth was still visible." @ CAPS1, in the unbearable heat without water and @ CAPS2 knows how many kilometers there are left by bike, it really made him feel like the saddest and most unlucky man in the world. The setting as a whole seemed almost designed to make the protagonist suffer not only from the natural elements, but also from things that just seemed to taunt him for it.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as it is difficult to go far on a bike when the place you are riding is dry, deserted, calm, hot, cold and direct. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if it says "there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind". This would make it difficult for a cyclist as you need a good supply of water and it is difficult to keep when there is nothing around. 

<START>

 

The cyclist chooses to take an old abandoned route to @ LOCATION1. The course had in some places no building to see making the cyclist lose hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the road making him all alone. So if something happened, who would know. During his adventure, he ran out of water, which made him dehydrated, which didn't help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider. The text reads: "The sun was starting to beat" (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The scorching sun made the cyclist sweat. He was losing water. It made him faster. The text says. “The flat road has been replaced by short, rolling hills” (Kurmaskie @ NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to climb exhausted him. He was getting faster. The text says. “I fell into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply in the sink” (Kurmaskie @ NUM3). The modern bathroom had good cold water. This allowed the rider to drink it. The water has replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain his strength. Then the cyclist could continue.

In the simple "DO NOT exceed the posted speed limit" this is a clear cut for survival as it looks like this man is fighting to stay alive. As I know riders pedal for hours and sometimes hundreds of miles he was riding where green grass and cool mountains collide, the tone and feel of the test would be completely different. He uses phrases like "... two hundred degrees, brain damage, birds would pick me up clean and heatstroke. @ CAPS1 all makes me want to read further in the essay to see s 'Will he be fine at the end of his trip ? I know what it feels like to run out of fluids because I have chronic dehydration. I couldn't imagine riding a bike and seeing only the hissing of the desert and the passage of the grass. It sounds like a terrible experience. If he was in a cooler, more colorful place, his experience wouldn't have been so horrible.       

<START>

 

The adjustment affected the rider in several ways. One way is in the story when he said it was very hot, that he could get dehydrated and could possibly have heat stroke, so the rides were windy. This could be a problem because he is tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just go straight ahead and get lost even more. It's all about how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider in the story.   

<START>

 

The characteristics of the "Rough Road ahead" parameter affect the rider. First of all, the weather causes most of its problems. Considering the cyclist was cycling in a California desert in June, the temperature must have been in the @ NUM1 range. This causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he declares: " I had hit my water bottles quite regularly " The heat therefore causes the cyclist to drive excessively and lack water, as well as the objects that the cyclist meets travel affects him. For example, while driving down a rough road, "a ridiculously large snake blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me." This saves the biker and probably scared him. The cyclsit is greatly affected by the characteristics of the story setting.        

<START>

 

The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact was in June, he was in the wilderness and the lack of water was what almost led to his own downfall. This hot desert setting seems hostile and I'm surprised he lived and was so lucky.

The characteristics of the decor had misled the cyclist. When he had left for the first time the city where the old men had advised him, the cyclist had high hopes because a glance and a serene appreciated to see very? of the struggle.

The setting affects the rider to a large extent. He finds it difficult to continue his journey. He started to lose hope, get tired and think he was going to die. The parameters played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around it. He had very little water and more places to go. He then encountered a large snake, which made the situation worse as he was afraid of no one around to help him. If he had followed his own instructions for the old men, he wouldn't have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip difficult without water, people, cities or buildings around him.

The characteristics of the “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ” test frame greatly affected the rider. At the start of this man's journey, he was confident in his abilities. "I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face." The rider was prepared for an exciting day and the frame supported that feeling. "The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them." @ CAPS1, as the setting started to change and his water ran out, the rider's attitude changed. He was "traveling through the high deserts of California in June" without much water and began to feel hopeless. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared, he fell into despair. "At one point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really looked like a diamond back that blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me." He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this scenery, he lost all hope of survival. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, having no more water, on those short rolling hills and under the extremely hot sun. The rider was affected by the characteristics of the frame, going from confidence, hopelessness and hopelessness to relief, the frame changes caused his attitude change throughout this trip.

The characteristics of the setting in " Difficult road, do not exceed the posted speed limit " significantly affect the rider. First of all, when the cyclist sees the grape juice plant, he remembers that he has no more water and that he even doubts that he will live. The text states: “ … a youth pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I lowered my head " (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The text later states: "At one point, tumbleweeds crossed my path ..." (kurmaskie). This indicates that the cyclist is feeling depressed and is primarily affected by these views. It could and would later ruin his self-esteem and think about dying.

The setting for the essay did not really help the author on his journey. There weren't a lot of structures on the way. Either that, cities say, "a ghost town". @ CAPS1 it could not have reassured the author that things were going his way. It was also very hot during his trip. The author says he "travels through the deserts of California in June". Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month, so it must have been extremely hot and humid. @ CAPS1 this must have taken its toll as he never saw anything really reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait shop. So the frame must have affected his confidence and his energy level certainly.        

<START>

 

The characteristics which define the effect of the cyclist are very clear in the case of this test which resene when @ CAPS1 the signs indicating " Rough @ CAPS2 in front : do not exceed the posted speed limit.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. In the essay it is written: "This place may have been a prosperous little place at one point - say, before the last world war - but that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town. . " This statement can affect the cyclist as he fears that if he runs into problems there will be no one to help him. This statement can also mean that they fear they are on the wrong track. In the essay it is written: "A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a coral they couldn't have in the larger mule greeted me." This statement just gives the rider the impression that this particular town is juice, and that no one has even been known to live here for years, @ MONTH1 to be decades. The different characteristics of the cyclist's journey in the test, many would fear the result, if they dreaded the journey too much and turned into "old timers" who had never left their porches, in order to experience such things.

The characteristics of the scenery affected the cyclist because, forty miles in the desert, I reached the first "toun". The desert scenery affected the cyclist because the cyclist, because the cyclist appeared on the road when the men with the settings came and affected the cyclist. The man was very mad. His water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. Large rings of dry sweat circled my shirt, and ?? he ?? this should fall out of the heat on a gorqeas day in june just because i listened to a man who was out of their ??? ???, ??? to hard.

The cyclist trusted a man who didn't know much about the world, he thought the guy would know how to get to the place he was looking for. The cyclist took his advice, he thought he would be there very soon so he started drinking his water very quickly. He realized that he had no more water and that the park he was going to was not nearby. The cyclist was frustrated and angry, he was now crossing the desert which made him layered and dehydrated. He passed this road which was a rough road with tumbleweeds and snakes which he continued until he sowed the company "@ CAPS1 Juice". He rushed in, went to the bathroom and drank the same water. When he got out an old man asked him if he needed his way, the cyclist said no.

During the passage "Do not exceed the speed limit", the cyclist endures many tests. One of those countless difficulties was the setting he found himself in. While lost, thirsty and exhausted, he stayed the entire time in "The High Deserts of California in June". This shows that the temperature has been unbearable most of the time. The cyclist would tire and become dehydrated faster than usual. Also, the surface it was riding on had many steep hills, as it says when it says "on a long crippling hill", it shows that the hills took a lot of energy to get up. And finally, the author says that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. This shows that if he needed help, there was no one to help him. the frame affected the rider in a negative way.

In stories, do not exceed the posted speed limit, there are very descriptive settings. In the stories, these settings have a big effect on the rider. With these parameters, the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first parameter described to you is " the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written on them ." This setting gives you a vivid picture of where the rider is heading. This setting also creates a kind of happy mood. That the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further into the cycle race that he noticed a change in terrain, "the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills." @ CAPS1 the cyclist lacks water and becomes very tired. Seeing it just crushes his mind. @ CAPS1 riding hills hard, but coming down hills knowing that something good is waiting for you on the other side of the hills. These two very different parameters give off very different sensations. The first one makes you think it's going to have such an easy and enjoyable bike ride. But that all changes when he reaches those horrible hills. The thought of having traveled miles of hills hurts your legs. On all the characteristics of the frame, an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by a beautiful spot.

In the story " Do not display the speed limit @ CAPS1 ", many characteristics of the frame affected the rider. The most difficult problem encountered by the author was the lack of water. "I pumped this handle for several minutes but the water didn't calm down and tried a drop or two it smelled like beaten acid. When @ CAPS2 left for the next train @ CAPS2 came onto a road that said "Bumpy road ahead, do not exceed the posted speed limit. The tarrain became more bumpy and difficult to cross. The determination the rider left at @ CAPS2 affected the regret that he hadn't listened to the old men who didn't think they knew what they were talking about. Due to the fact that they never left their porches. As you can see, the most defined setting affected the rider either physically or mentally.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider with his mood and what happens when he travels through the desert to a town. For example, his mood changes when the old man asks him for a map and his attitude changes by the caution of the new one, the new road he has taken and then the terror when he thought he was going to die "I was going to die and the birds would choose me own ”so pride when the old man asks for a map and the author says “ I own a really good map ”But as he travels to Yosemite the setting changes when he goes to a desert type of place then goes a bait shop at rest, then probably on its way to its destination.

“ Do not exceed the posted speed limit ” by Joe Kurmaskie showed that the characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider. First of all, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle. It affected her because if they had been in a car or on a bus much less energy would have been consumed. Second, the cyclist started to run out of water. This adjustment didn't help as they were on a bike which kept them hydrated. Another setting that affected the plot was the Deserted Cities. If they hadn't been deserted, everything would have been better. These characteristics greatly affected the rider.

The characteristics of the setting affect the cycles in such a way that it affected its altermmation to continue. For example, after @ NUM1 miles he looked at the " dilapidated plane, several rusty bumps and the corral… This sight troubled me." In the desert, its water tasted like "battery acid". He also goes on to say that it was a "test of my inner spirit". He also indicates that he went with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds. This passage shows the obstacles that he had to go through and that he did with a little confidence. Although his situation was somewhat unbearable, he continued to strive.

The setting of the story affects the rider in most of the story. The heat made her hot and thirsty while the trip gave her a lack of energy and even a craving for water. In paragraph @ NUM1, the writer says that one of the hills was “long and has. ” The hill was exhausting it and draining what was left of its energy. The setting in the story was the biggest party if the road was flat and bumpy while the temperature was

The adjustment can easily affect the rider in several ways. The area the cyclist was in seemed abandoned, which doesn't give this person a good idea. If a city has been abandoned or a road has been abandoned, there will automatically be no noticeable building structures for a period of time. In addition, the shape and shape of the road seemed very dangerous for the cyclist, not only because of the narrow and rocky path, but also because of the wildlife. In the text it is said that a poisoned diamond-backed snake was directly in front of the cyclist. This example explains how wildlife can become a more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether hot or cold, the rider was limited to water and being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the rider. The conditions of the frame of the frame in which the cyclist was found became a disadvantage for him.

The characteristics of the frame have an effect on the rider. He's going to be doing this bike ride through the deserts of "California in June." This will obviously have an effect on him because it will be very fast. At one point he said, “ The sun was starting to hit, but I barely noticed it. " @ CAPS1, does having all these ghost towns bothered him because no one else was there and he was starting to get out of the water. The weather outside was starting to affect him, and he said, “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage…” you. If he was in a different setting, that feeling of hopelessness wouldn't be in the story. This is how the setting affects the rider.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. One feature is the weather. When a rider is traveling, the weather can greatly affect the setting. For example, if it started to rain, the roads could become very slippery and dangerous for cycling. The cyclist and his bicycle could crash and die. Just because of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important because wherever you are different animals are doing different things. If the rider knows the animals around the area he is riding, he could stay safe and not be injured. It's better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing what will happen next.

As the characteristics have changed in the frame it becomes more difficult for the rider. At first, the rider started off quite easily. He had flat, smooth roads to travel. It started before the sun could. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite, my name wrote it all down " He kept his mind out of the sun and it helped him." Then he came onto a freeway which made it a bit more difficult. I noticed that the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. " So he had to pedal harder and tire him out faster." " At one point, weeds have crossed my path. Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. "By the weeds falling, it meant he was in the desert during a hot period. So he had little water left and he was starting to get dehydrated. C ' was a difficult task for him to overcome. With the changing terrain it becomes more difficult for him.

In the story, there are a lot of affects that the cyclist has to deal with. He has to go through a lot of bad things just to finish. The cyclist should beware of a rough road he is taking.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider. He was driving on a route he had little confidence to end up anywhere. It was the first time I participated in this race and had no knowledge about it, which forced the rider to rework. The temperature was very hot, where there was little shade, the sun was beating down on it. The road was very discouraging. All the rider wanted was water and the road kept tormenting him with false hopes. In the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get was mud and water that tasted like battery acid. Then he arrived at an old derelict building that approved to be a former Welch grape juice bottling plant . The cyclist seems to be approaching something to drink, but is left with nothing.

During the bike ride, the unbearable conditions changed his attitude when he first starts up, the reader may feel frustration with the elders and directions.

The “ Rough Road Ahead : Do Not Exceed The Speed Limit ” rider list has been influenced by the environment in several ways. The most evoked characteristic in the environment was the lack of water. The cyclist was going to die because there was no water and he was really dehydrated. Another characteristic was the heat. It was really hot where the narrator was riding his bike. When @ CAPS1 is hot, the heat dehydrates you. The narrator was therefore pushed to extremes because of the heat. Plus, everyone was gone from the towns, so every town he came to haunted him until he got mad at the tenants he spoke to and got really frustrated. The flat, smooth road gave way to hills, making it more difficult to drive. Finally, the serpent of the road affected him because he had to avoid it. All of these things affected him.

Joe Kurmaskie's "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" is truly a man against nature story. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and the relentless sun. He first notices the sun, above him, expected in California June, but no less. Next are rolling hills and elevation tilt, going up a hill means your body is working harder, burning calories, and getting its much-needed water supply. Then there is the man a lot of torture. A speed limit of @ NUM1, if he got bad 12. And even worse, a billboard " a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth ", it really touched his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach.

If I had the choice to cycle in California or Vermont, it would be a no-brainer to cycle in Vermont. The temperature in Vermont is reportedly much cooler than in California. In the story, the cyclist complains about "large rings of dried sweat" and the possibility of heat stroke. It is proven that when the temperatures rise, you tend to lose more water from your body. If the rider had traveled to a cooler site at a different time of year, he would not have struggled with dehydration on his bike ride.

The characteristics of the setting of the story greatly affected the cyclist. In the morning, when he began his journey, he was impatient and determined to reach his destination. Although it took him forty miles to get to the first "city," he didn't seem to care. “ Yosemite's worst chills and tumultuous rivers had my name written all over it, ” that's what crossed his mind once the sun started to hit. This means he didn't mind it or was unsettled by it at the time. But the further her journey went, the more hot and less plentiful water she had left. After he passed a few "disturbing sights", because they were abandoned and there was no one around, he started to worry. The cyclist got to the point where he said he was sucking pebbtes, in order to circulate the last saliva he had in his mouth. In his despair, he finally saw a sign of hope that gave him the strength to carry on. When he arrived at GARY AND @ CAPS1 FISH CAMP, his emotions and spirit changed from gloomy to grateful.

The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes that he became dehydrated and describes: " the sun was starting to hit and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ". @ CAPS1's struggle for him was crossing the path of a "ridiculously large snake" and "trying to keep his balance in his dehydrated state. Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme heat, and hitting a pump to water, find the water unfit for consumption and “in the vicinity of zoological degrees.” @ The problem with the CAPS1 parameter for kurmaskie was that the area seemed deserted and he had to continue for a kilometer until this that he could find a place with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate.

The characteristics of the frame continue to affect the cyclist because first his hope and then he relishes his despair. He laughed when people gave him the right directions and now "It was a sad, desperate laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel bad for myself." said the cyclist, referring to the first city. The reason this affects the rider is that at first he was fine, then he got thirsty and bad things happened. that's how it affects the cyclist.     

<START>

 

In the story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", written by Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics of the frame affected the author in several ways. One feature was the hills. The speed limit affected the author because he felt he was moving too slowly. In the story, when it says "I was doing a water depletion @ NUM1", this is proof     

<START>

 

This is how the setting affects the rider. One is the hot, dry heat of the California desert. It made him hot and thirsty, which made him run out of water. The scorching heat of the desert had made water a substance he could not drink from the well. The water bottle contained only a few tempting sips that weren't enough to quench his thirst. The scorching heat that would force birds to pluck it dries up all of these examples, making it difficult for the reader to follow the advice of the ancients. It made him realize that the time comes wisely and that young people can make stupid mistakes. The heat had only made one trip for her inner soul to survive. This is where the setting affects the most cycles.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider mainly because he was in a desert. There were no shops, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long, and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn't have much water to drink.  

<START>

 

Many characteristics of the frame affect the rider. Several main features include the city of loading cars. it's not really cities anymore, and the water pump. These two examples gave him hope, but neither gave him relief. The city he first saw could give him water, but everything was dilapidated and weakened. “I came to the first 'city'. This place may have been a prosperous little place at one point ... refer to the @ NUM1 War of Words. He says the city could have given him more water and energy, but it seemed like it was over for this city. In addition, he cycled through a much needed water pump. He tried to pump water but was unsuccessful. "I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water was not cooling." A working water pump would have been huge for him, giving him more strength to ride a bike. However, again this was very misleading           

<START>

 

This is how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider. An example is " the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills ". It changes the effect because by saying it will show how tired he's going to be or the job he's trying to do on the hills. Another example would be the “ high deserts of California in June ”. It is to say that it is hot outside and very tiring. I think that means because in California it is very hot and in June the “daylight saving time” is very tiring. This is how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider.           

<START>

 

The characteristics affect the rider because of the way the road is made. If the road is downhill, the cyclist can ride faster. The road might be up the hill, so it @ MOIS1 is going slow. There could be a possibility that the road contains stones or grass which could be difficult to cross. So the effect of the cyclist depends on how the roads are made.    

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider because the worse the characteristics, the more water he wants. For example, in the essay it says at one point some tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous big snake blocked the majority of the sidewalk in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds, I think of drought because it's like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of the heat because it's the time for the snakes to come out when it's hot. The cyclist therefore thought of the dryness of his throat and the dryness of his environment making him want water. Another feature is when he saw a shortbread image of a young boy pouring a glass of refreshing juice into his mouth, which probably made the cyclist wish he could drink this refreshing drink.

In "Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit", riders were affected by the characteristics of the frame. She was first affected by the old men who gave her a "shortcut" for her trip to Yosemite National Park. Then she was hit by a ghost town that had no water to give her. Then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rocky road that had some tumbleweed and a huge snake that was quite difficult to cross. Then, in the end, she stumbled upon " Gary and Wilber's Fishing Camp " where she decided to make decisions on her own. All of these things in the frame affected the rider in a negative way, with the exception of " Gary and Wilber's fishing camp " which saved her from dehydration.         

<START>

 

In the new “ Rough Road Ahead ” the rider was faced with many problems. One of them is the tuning function. I believe this has a great effect. The setting is in a dessert, which is very hot, there is no water around and usually no one lives in a dessert. @ CAPS1 is that there was a lack of water. In the text it says: “The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. @ CAPS1 The book setting that affects the rider is that it's June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist finds himself in a dessert traveling many kilometers.        

<START>

 

The rider's settings affect the rider's performance. If it is too hot, the cyclist may slow down due to the sun beating down on him. If it is too cold, the rider puts on more clothes that could weigh them down to achieve the speed they need. The bike must be stable. Driving on bumpy roads, braking, speeding, chains in good condition. The area where cyclists ride sets the mood. If it is a beautiful landscape, the cyclist may be in a good mood as the landscape is gloomy and gloomy with bad weather behind him, the cyclist might not be as happy as he could be. These types of things @ MONTH1 help determine how the parameters may affect the rider.       

<START>

 

In the “ Rough Road Ahead ” test, the frame greatly affects riders. The desert climate @ LOCATION1 invades the cyclist. For example, the route was further away, which it not only takes at @ LOCATION1, but also has no place to get water. Heat and lack of water combine for fatal dehydration for cyclists. The framework now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He has to go on and pray for a city to appear, so he @ MONTH1 replenishes his water supply and hydrates again.       

<START>

 

Many different things were affected on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest part in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist met the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a "ghost town" where there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who was cooking in extremely dry and hot weather. This caused an issue where the rider believed he would die in the desert due to the weather, the instructions given to him, and the lack of water. When the cyclist comes across the bait shop, he knows he has been saved. He rehydrated and refused an old man's instructions because these features of the setting were causing his problems: old people, dry weather, and water.     

<START>

 

There are a few things that affect the rider in the story. One of the ways it is affected is dehydration. In the story of dehydration, it is written, “The water bottle only contained a few mouthwatering sips. Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day. A good effect on the rider was that there was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad effect on him was not asking for the direction of a guy due to heatstroke on a beautiful June day just because listening to gentlemen who hadn't left their porch for a decade, Mr. 'made them laugh'. Another thing that bothered him was the poisonous snake. "At one point some weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake - it really looked like a diamond back."        

<START>

 

The cyclist not knowing where he was going got the wrong information and he followed him. He was glad to know that he also knew where he was going. During his journey he was accessed a lot of things like the sun. The weather conditions of their exaction and the big snake he saw. He was affected by the sun because he got dehydrated and had hardly any water left for him as he was also getting so hot that the trip was very difficult and made his mood weird while following the direction in which he was led by a big snake that he meets at the case slic desn not while making their announcement was afraid that he was going to be attacked unlike anyone else to make his way. The features affect him because he doesn't know where he was going and he waits for her to cut. Then he was going in the wrong direction and he was not prepared for the trip because the weather conditions were “ summer time ”, it was hot and he was riding a bike, not a car.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider with his train of thought. On page @ NUM1 it says, “ I knocked my water bottles quite regularly and traveled through the high deserts of California in June. " This gives an impression of warmth and portends perhaps the lack of water that will later. As he passed a snake, "trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." Thus, the cyclist will probably start to feel dizzy and lose hope. On page @ NUM2 he says, " ... I could have heatstroke ... " which means he's starting to think about the worst things that could happen. Which affects him because he starts to lose hope and thinks he won't be able to. On page @ NUM3 he said, “I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean…” At this point, the conditions he was in were tough and worried him. This is how the characteristics of the decor have affected the cyclist throughout history.

With little water, the adjustment was not useful to the rider. Joe @ PERSON1 said, " There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind " (@ PERSON1). After getting bad directions from a few old men, getting people to pass in cars or near shops would likely help the rider ask for directions. @ PERSON1 said, "working the rusty water pump handle with all my might" (@ PERSON1). Not having water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of nowhere this is a problem. @ PERSON1 also said: "The flat road has been replaced by short hills" (@ PERSON1). With little water and a weak body it must have been difficult to get on and off, @ NUM1 also said, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ” (@ PERSON1). I sprinkle your lungs and the heat of the sun as it becomes more difficult for your body to work.

The setting of the story affected the cyclist. The set-up takes place in June. It is very hot and the cyclist is very dehydrated. You can imagine how hot it was when he said, " wipe the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage ." It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several different ways. For example, it was in June and he was in @ CAPS1 in California. It was very hot and dehydrated. Also, he didn't know where he was going, so he had to rely on other people's instructions. He must also be dehydrated. This is what affected the cyclist.

The characteristics of the parameters of " Do not exceed posted speed limit " by Joe Kurmaskie were difficult and difficult. A biker crosses todi, California, a difficult region to navigate. It was a hot and long ride that he was so dehydrated that the sweat was dried around his neck. The solo cyclist said: "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." He had nowhere to find food or water. It was deserted. He thought that if he died, no one would find him faster than the birds would pick him up cleanly. The test " difficult road: do not exceed the speed limit posted by @ PERSON1 shows that a solo cyclist is very independent.

In the story Do not exceed the posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had to face many obstacles. For example, he needed to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions came from older men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the rider had to decide which direction to take when there was a fork in the road. He chose a path which the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Additionally, the cyclist encountered flat roads leading to hills, snakes blocking his path, and a state of dehydration that could have killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame some obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park.

In the essay " Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit " Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist in different ways. First of all, he listened to the old man, so he was on the wrong track. So he's traveling and it's a hot June day in the California deserts. The odds are stacked against him from the start. "The water bottles contained only a few mouthwatering sips, large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt, and the growing awareness that I needed a drop in a flash. heat on a beautiful day in June ... "(Kurmaskie @ NUM1) From the ganle you can tell he is tired and almost out of water. This puts a lot of pressure on the rider but he manages to do it.

The setting clearly has a huge effect on the rider. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride, but as the road turns into small rolling hills, cycling becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence which reads : " It is a long and crippling hill ... " This shows that the hill is a very difficult obstacle. It is also affected by the things that come with the change of terrain. For example, a the sentence reads "... tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake, it really looked like a diamond that blasted most of the sidewalk in front of me." It underscores how remote the area he's really biking in is, and shows how that affects his trip mentally and physically.

The decor effect are two elders sitting on their porch in the desert since Carter was in office. It was getting light and he had to walk @ NUM1 miles to get to the next town. So he gets on a bike and goes to the next town. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour and it was traveling 12 miles per hour as was the water flow. He went up and down hills. He finally came to the next city to live.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. in the essay, the author describes how the frame is hot, it's bumpy, it makes him sweat, it tires him, he also lacks water because of his thirst. The road gets very stony at one point. The narrator states that “ the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). There is also a photograph that shows how rough the terrain is. It's barrain with nothing around.

The characteristics of the frame affect the cyclist because, the cyclist is dehydrated and has to find horrible conditions on a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, making it difficult for what he is trying to do, which is to receive water. Also, since the rider is hot and needs water, he is delusional at this point and probably does not know what is going on. In the story, the main feature of the author's decor is the road. “ A difficult road to cover. " This explains that the cyclist must ride on rough roads, and to do this is very dangerous dehydrated are some of the characteristics adjustment affecting the cyclist.

The settings have a huge impact on the rider. When he first comes to the "city @ CAPS1" he isn't really worried, he laughs a bit and thinks he's funny saying. “ This place might have been a prosperous little place at one point - say, before the last world war. Then after he said it was like that he laughed. When it gets dark on the road with the risky water pipe he starts to switch to conservation and starts to get scared. He says. " I would come from the water - a test for my inner spirit "It shows he was afraid. After seeing the abandoned grape juice factory, he says something like birds are going to pick it up cleanly and leave it behind. the same expensive bike gear. It clearly shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would confirm this is when he talks about writing in his journal about the old men giving him these directions. When he finally reaches the store. balt he is relieved and goes to the bathroom and drinks water. He also says he will buy bait even if he doesn't have a cane. These examples show the many ways the frame has affected The cyclist.

In the story, "Do not exceed the posted speed limit, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider. To stay cool on a hot summer day, it may be necessary to find shade. Just to add to the pity of history. There was no one in eight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. " This factor does not help the rider at all, in fact it only makes the rider more exhausted. Another element of the story that affects the cyclist is the lack of water. At the beginning of the story, the author explains : “ The water bottle only contained a few sips of alcohol. " With more of kilometers, the cyclist begins to lose hope of living to happen. The characteristic of the hills also affects the cyclist. The rider is tired enough already, and to add to his misfortune, "flat roads have been replaced by short, rolling hills". @ CAPS1 the hills are short, they still could have impacted him because of the ropollive hills. Many features of the story have affected the mood of the story.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider. It affected him because he said @ NUM1 miles and then was in the first town, thinking the rider was getting excited and was sort of the most done, he thought he was passing fast. When the cyclist arrived at the first town he said she looked dead. And then after he kept moving he somehow knew he wasn't going anywhere. Then, after thinking it over, he noticed that he had listened to old people who had never even left their porch. So after the cyclist had reached the first town, he knew right away that he should never listen to old people again. Because this first city looked like it hadn't been inhabited for years.

The features of the setting on the Yosemite National Park Trail greatly affected the rider. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the Californian desert. Besides the heat, the cyclist had to overcome the rugged terrain of the short rolling hills. It made the cyclist tired and fatigued. In addition to his weakness and extreme heat, he also lacked water, which caused him to become dehydrated. "Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt, and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke… laugh."

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider as the climate can be hot, the road can be bumpy, and the city can be deserted. For example, “ Rough Road Ahead.

Hot, lack of water, all is lost, this is how the characteristics of the frame affected the rider. First, it was hot. In one sentence he said the sun was starting to hit. Also that the water smelled like two hundred degrees. This sweat was all over him. So it must have been very hot. Then, the lack of water affected him and his performance. How was it because he was dying in need of water. He tried everything to get water but succeeded with almost no water. Finally, he was lost. The card he had was fake and the trip was not what he expected. But in the end he was resurrected. So even towards all these negative affects, he still managed to become positive. Basically this story is about how, if you do your best, never give up and try new things that you are most likely to be successful in in life and other things that you are involved in @ MONTH1.

The conditions that the cyclist has to face are always problems or aids. Let's say there is a rocky part going uphill. It will definitely slow him down. But if there is a nice part of gentle descent that will accelerate it. and takes a lot of peddling work out of his hands.

The cyclist lost hope as he was in California desserts in June. The rider started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump pumping acid-tasting water from battery. When he said the " Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit " sign , he was very careful. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die there. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says: “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.

In "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" Joe Kurmaskie he describes his challenging bike trip through California. In the essay, he describes the weather with "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June". While this @ MONTH1 does not directly characterize the weather, the reader may stick to a clear picture of the sweltering heat of a summer desert. When the author stumbles upon the "ghost town" followed by the dilapidated hut , and finally from the sign indicating "Rough Road Ahead", his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The desperation of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die in the desert of dehydration and exhaustion. It can be related to anyone lost in adverse conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes with it. We have the impression that everything is against you, that nothing is playing in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip on “ Difficult road : do not exceed the posted speed limit.

The parameter affecting the cyclist was that exhaustion would happen to him. What made matters worse, he was in the heat sweating, which also caused dihydration.

For starters, one characteristic affecting the rider was the lack of water, which is indicated when the speaker says that when I tried a drop or two it tasted like battery acid - it was l 'one of the most important factors he had risked.

As the reader listened to and followed the instructions of the elders, he faced many problems and also learned a lesson. As he started to ride until dawn he had strong legs and even a smile on his face. Over time, he quickly found himself running out of water and losing energy. @ CAPS1's summer day made him sweat and started to think his birds would prey on his body like it died on its way to Yosemite. When he finally arrived in a city, he quickly refreshed himself and learned he would and started going his own way - going places.

The characteristics of the “Do not exceed posted speed limit” test setting adversely affected the rider. The more he drove, the more he thought negatively and had a lot of doubts. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he would not make it. For example, when the cyclist does not notice anything in sight, his tone changes. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. I started to divide the trip into distances that I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could go that far, everything would be fine ”. He looked uncertain and a little nervous. As the journey continued, the cyclist seemed to lose hope. “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean, leaving only expensive outdoor gear and a diary. Forward ”.

The characteristics of the frame are very effective for the rider. It sits in a desert area of California and has limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry. He barely had a little water to drink and he must have come a long way in the hot and humid weather. The lack of water could have caused him to become dehydrated. Another obstacle he encountered on this bike trip in Yosemite National Park were the hills he faced. At first he was on level ground, now he has hills he has to climb which makes it much more difficult for him. Another obstacle he encountered was the serpent he encountered. This setting had a lot of obstacles for this guy. If it hadn't been for the heat and lack of water, maybe he could have made things a little easier.         

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame strongly affected the rider. The rolling hills were the cyclist's most difficult problem because they were long and crippling. Going downhill would take a lot of energy and determination from the rider. Since the rider was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, it would be extremely difficult to ride on hills. The features of the setting did not help the rider to maintain good health, as their difficulty caused the rider to dehydrate and possibly fall from heat stroke. However, the cyclist kept a positive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relieved when he finally stumbled upon the "Gary and Wilbells Fishing Camp". In conclusion, the characteristics of the frame affected the rider as they forced him to work harder and put in more effort, but with determination you can accomplish anything!

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in the new " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ". The rider's mood seems to change as the road and setting change. The narration says, “A large highway sign jumped over me. I read: Bumpy road ahead: Don't exceed the posted speed limit… sometimes life can seem so cruel (Kurmaskie). Slowly, as the terrain gets harder and harder, the rider feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a city he becomes happy but his dreams are quickly shattered. The hard cycling terrain can be seen in the photo which can affect the cyclist by making him tired due to the lack of water and the feeling of hopelessness he gets when he loses energy and thinks he is going to die .

Some features of the setting that affected the rider were signs indicating speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill in the road. It affected the rider making him tired because he said "I 'm wiping the sweat from my eyes ".

The frame had a huge effect on the rider. One of the effects was the lack of water in the area he was in, which was a dessert. In addition, the lack of people in the neighborhood did not help the cyclist at all. The hills on the road made it more difficult for the rider as it reduced the little energy he had left. Also, the sun hitting him made his body warmer and made it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do.

As part of “ Bumpy Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ”. The cyclist is strongly affected. At first, the author takes advantage of a nice campground outside of Lodi in California when the "old folks" told the cyclists the directions and from his point of view "they looked so sure of themselves. highlighting landmarks and spouting out towns that I would like to come up with this jovial auntie So the rider used that information and it wasn't for The Better.

How the characteristics of the frame affect the rider because when the old man told him, do you know where to go? And the other guy was like " yes sir ! I have a really good map ”so how did that change for the man riding this bike he saw all these towns and a sign for Rough Road ahead. That man would always stick to the future. What changed is that he saw all these buildings, the city, and walked away. I think he could stay with the future.

In history the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest problems was the terrian he had to maneuver them. The terrain was hilly, having to climb a hill on a bike is tiring and wears you out faster than flat terrain, forcing it to use more energy. The heat was also unbearable which made it impossible for him to concentrate, the cyclist did everything he could to remain conscious while maneuvering through the terrain and the desert landscape being a huge wilderness of rolling mountains that he took pushed forward, finding no civilization anywhere to refill the water. For example, if the terrain weren't so rugged it would have made it easier for him by using less energy and less strain on his legs, the desert heat that was pounding him probably slowed his progress as well. The heat will make you move slower and a cyclist going down a road without shade will make the ride longer and impossible. Ultimately, his willpower and determination won him over to the scenery, so he could get the water he needed to complete his journey.

In this essay, the characteristics of the frame irritate the cyclist towards the elderly. In this essay, old men give direction to the cyclist, and instead of using a map, he takes their advice. However, their information is outdated and takes the cyclist through hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist puts all his energy into traveling to unknown towns without importance and without water. The cyclist reproaches the old men for having given him indications which made him lose energy. However, he has shown himself to truly become himself for taking their advice and using a credit card on actual directions.

In the short story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " by Joe Kurmaskie. the frame greatly affects the rider and his state of mind. When the landscape is pretty and cheerful, he is happy too. This is what shows the author who writes: " renounced the serenity of an early summer evening ". This quote describes the landscape as a greenhouse or a peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, “denied.” You don't appreciate something unless you are happy or in a cherry state of mind. Therefore, the peaceful landscape affected the cyclist making him happy. the same can be said for happy landscapes too. This is what is found when the author says, "At one point, weeds crossed my path and the growing awareness that I could fall from heat stroke." This quote describes the landscape as a place that they are crushing. Stereotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely places. This lonely landscape takes so full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimistic and does anything that could go wrong, not anything that could get better. It is found around us every day. We often talk about the poor and the homeless who live with a low standard of living. They must exist with the cyclist concerned.

The characteristics of the tuning affect the rider because the tuning has changed so drastically. The wide, flat road turned into " short, rolling hills ". Because he already lacked water, it was more difficult for him to have the will and determination to go up and down these hills. His resolve began to fade because he began to see vast open lands with nothing but " tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes ." He had the impression that he was going to become dehydrated because the sun was beating hard and there was no more water. He used pebbles he found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes he would choke on one because he feels so worthless.

In the story “Don't exceed the posted speed limit”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many difficulties on his way to Yosemite due to the characteristics of the frame. The fact that it was a hot summer day contributed to his difficulties. With little water, it was easier for him to become dehydrated. In the text, the author writes: “ I could fall from a heat stroke, on a beautiful day in June. » (Kurmaskie, @ NUM1). This lets the reader know that the June heat was very dangerous for the rider. There was also no one around, except " some old people who have not left the confines of their perches since the water was off " (Kurmaskie, @ NUM2). The narrator emphasizes his point of view taking directions from these people since their directions are also poor. It can be inferred from this that he meant that they were obviously obsolete in the opposite directions, because the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story struggled to get to his destination due to the setting.

The terrain in Joe Kurmaskie's "Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the cyclist had to face many difficulties. He was already running out of water from the arduous journey and then the environment turned against him. The narration states: "I noticed that the flat road changing terrain has been replaced by short rolling hills." (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). This means that the cyclist will put more energy into climbing these hills. The energy he barely has. This will drain almost all the energy available to the cyclist. Another example is : “ At one point, tumbleweeds crossed my path ” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). This means the rider is in the middle of nowhere with almost no water and energy causing even more problems. In conclusion, Joe Kurmaskie's setting “Do not exceed posted speed limit” caused many problems for the rider.

In the story "Bumpy Road Ahead", the setting affects the rider. The rider is affected by the lack of water, the distance he has to cover and the rough terrain. “Bottles of water only contain a few mouthwatering sips. large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt, ”this statement shows that he was out of water, was tired and hot. The setting has affected the cyclist a lot in history.

The rider struggles in the lack of water, heat and rough terrain, all of which have made riding more difficult. First, the lack of water impacted the amount of energy he had to keep going. Second, the heat affected his trip as well. It was difficult for him to continue, he thought he was going to die. And the birds would attack his corpse. Finally, the terrain did not help. The trip had a lot of hills and it used a lot of energy so I made it more difficult. In conclusion, these are things that have worked against the rider.

In this I will tell you how the cyclist was affected. One reason is that the heat made her drink more than she ran out of water. Next was the deceitful old guys who gave him instructions.

The characteristics of the frame can affect the rider because, let's say there was nothing. It might make you want to go faster and leave out your inner speed demon. That's all I can really tell you.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider, as there are no cars, buildings, water or people in sight. It goes from the flat road to the hills. Even though he had no water, he was determined to keep pedaling. “ Rough road ahead, don't exceed posted speed limit ” At this point, he was out of water and was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation, I would feel hopeless. There was no sign of hope. He just saw endless hills and that's it. Then when he saw the building above the hills, he thought he was home free. So he cycled to the building, and this one and all the others were abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die. In conclusion, the characteristics of the frame affected the rider a lot because seeing nothing gives him no hope. If he had had cars and buildings on both sides of him, it probably would have given him confidence, but it wasn't. He's in the middle of nowhere. He finally came over and said, “ So, as easily as a turn, my troubles, my thirst, and my fear were all behind me. "

There are many features of the parameter that affect the fastest cycle. His dehydration started with the sun setting over him and his thirst for water. He was primarily affected while out of the water and off the road by an Abbanond Welchs grape juice factory. “A shortbread photo of a young boy pouring a glass of refreshing juice into his mouth was still visible. I bowed my head. Then, with almost nothing left, he spotted a bait shop. Somehow, I got away from the abandoned juice and dream factory, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as a bend in a bend, my troubles, my thirst and my fear were all behind me. @ CAPS1 is when he saw "Gary and @ CAPS2 Fish camp - If you want some far bait, the big ones were your best bet, thus solving his problems.

The characteristics of the environment in which the cyclist affects not only his mood, but also his physical condition. To begin with, it is mentioned that he is in "the high deserts of California in June", @ CAPS1 it is implied that the weather is hot, which causes the author to sweat while he is cycling. Then there is a change in terrain and it quickly approaches "rolling hills" which are more difficult to cycle through. Finally, the author sees a sign that says " ROUGH ROAD AHEAD : DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT ". After passing this road, he approaches a photo of a boy drinking juice that is displayed on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated before. Such features of his surroundings played a big role in the author's mood change.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. First of all, it is the sun that beats. The heat dehydrates him and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor. It takes him the time and energy he has to happen. Another key ingredient in the setting was the desert. There was no one to help her and there was no place to draw water. In conclusion, the setting has been an important factor in the story.

The setting affects the rider in several ways. On the one hand, it crosses the high deserts of California during the month of June. It is naturally hot in summer, but in the desert it is twice as hot. This means it will dehydrate faster and need more water. The only water the rider can find is from an old pump, but he couldn't drink it because it was very hot; bad tasting. “ When I tried a drop it tasted like battery acid ” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). His road was empty, so no one could help him. In addition, the terrain was bad. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. “ The growing awareness that I could fall from heat stroke made me laugh ” (@ NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the back of the black diamond. The executive also affected him mentally because he had been yelling at himself in silence ever since taking instructions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right path, instead of trying a shortcut which he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous. The rider is affected in many ways, both mentally and physically.

  The adjustment poses major problems for the cyclist in the test " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ". The cyclist faced a desert, traveling in extremely humid temperatures and without water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas with no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water for part of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself it was no use. In the story it says, “It didn't really matter. I was on the verge of death… ". The extreme measures of the tuning caused the rider to lose control, putting stones in his mouth so that he could not think of his thirst. Overall, the frame caused major problems. to the cyclist, physically and mentally.

The ways that can affect the rider by the setting of the place are the way the road is formed or the rise of hills and the roughness of the ride. There was a sign saying " Bumpy road ahead : do not exceed posted speed limit ". This sign if he hadn't seen it he would have exceeded speed or didn't know how fast he had to go as a cyclist and got injured. The road was made for cars so the speed limit is difficult to respect

In Joe Kurmaskie's “Rough Road Ahead: Staying Within The Posted Speed Limit” story, the setting affects the rider. One setting that affected it was the first setting. In this setting he used his water and it was hot. this affected the rider as he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die. The text said it when he said "I could fall from heat stroke", later when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory he thought how thirsty he was. It affected him because usually when you think of thirst, you are more thirsty. It also made him disappointed. The final adjustment affected him as he finally had water and was not thirsty. This is how the setting affected the rider.

On this long bike ride, the cyclist was affected by the setting. It has been affected by the lack of water, the heat and the wrong directions, throughout history the rider has run out of water because of the wrong directions of some men. mouthwatering sips. He ran out of water and became dehydrated during his trip. The heat has a large part of his dehydration during the bike ride. I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was even longer due to bad instructions from old men. “ Because I listened to gentlemen who hadn't come out of their porch in decades, made me laugh. The gentlemen gave him the wrong directions because in their day it was good information. But the terrain did not change and the directions were wrong. When you go for bike rides, the setting of the rides is a big help or a bad help. The rider experienced how the setting of a ride to cycling can affect it a lot.

" The flat road was replaced by short hills," After throwing down the hills he sighed " ROUGH ROAD AHEAD : DO NOT EXCEED THE DISPLAYED SPEED LIMIT ". Now he has to cross bumpy roads. "At one point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake - it really looked like a diamond blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me." Now the poor guy was dealing with snakes bigger than him! Fortunately, he walked past the snake, alive. "Above a long, overwhelming hill, a building appeared."

In the article "Rough Road Ahead: Staying Within The Posted Speed Limit", the frame characteristics affected the rider in several ways. The cyclist felt dark humor, despair and then relief because of the characteristics of the setting. The cyclist felt black humor, due to the features. It was because it was very ironic where he was. It was a hot desert and he needed something to drink. He walks past a closed juice factory. It excited his dark humor. The cyclist felt despair because of the features. It was because as far as he could see, “There was no one in sight, not a building, a car, a structure of any kind. It made him feel like there was no way he could survive. It made him despair. The rider felt relief later because of the features. He finally got to a bait shop. When it was live and he felt relieved of this, "So as easily as ? ? ?

In the test " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " by @ PERSON1, many characteristics of the setting affect the rider. First of all, when he got to the first 'city' and said, 'This place might have been a prosperous little place at one time - let's say, before the last world war.' This deserted ghost town scenery looked like a joke and had a little effect on the rider as it was the start of the day and he still had a good supply of water. However, when he got to the dilapidated hangar surrounded by several rusty pumps, the effect was not so smooth. He said: “The sight was disturbing. Then when he got on all fours and started using the pump, the situation hardly improved. All that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid. Finally, when he arrived at the grape juice factory of an abandoned welch after several kilometers. It took a heavy toll on him as the water supply was low and he went from disappointment to disappointment. This framework in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless. It was only determination that got this cyclist out.

The characteristics of the setting in “ Rough Road Ahead ” affect the rider. The cyclist started at a campground and chatted with some old dogers, and he asked them how to get to Yosemite, and pointed to a shortcut that turned out to be obsolete. On the road to Yosemite, he sees only abandoned towns. He is really thirsty and there is no water anywhere. He thought he was going to die. He said, "I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean." It was a hot summer day and there were wild grasses and snakes by the side of the road and he felt hotter and thirstier than he would have been if it was cooler and sore. there was a large river flowing along the road. But it was hot and dry in California and looked like a desert and it made him feel like he was dying because he was in the middle of nowhere so the setting affected the rider

This cyclist had the terrain conditions to deal with, he didn't have too much water with him and there wasn't a good spring near him that he could see. He just had to keep going. He also explained how rough the road was. It was contradictory about how long it took him to get to the next place with water. In addition, he was in a desert area.

In the story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the characteristics of the setting affect the rider. They affect the confidence and hope of the cyclist. I say this because throughout history he sees things that might be relevant to other people, like which towns are supposed to be the best "ghost towns" and the road from the flat to the hills. Yet he goes on and then says "what I thought was my last burst of energy", "I was going to die". The dosent cyclist thinks he can continue but manages to continue hoping the next horizon will see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he couldn't go on, he could die.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. One of the reasons the frame's features affect it is because it's hot outside, which makes it need more water.

In the short story " Rough Rode Ahead ", a cyclist is pushed through an extremely difficult environment while trying to get to Yosemite National Park. In the story, the narrator takes a trip to Yosemite National Park after obtaining instructions from two older men, what the narrator does not know is that the road is indeed difficult. A narrator says, “ I calmed myself down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated @ NUM1. The narrator really takes a beating from the trip and this dry, dry weather really is a story.

The setting affects the characteristics of the rider because if the rider was riding @ LOCATION1 around June, the @ MONTH1 effect had not been as severe. But overall, starting in a warm place with little water was not a good thing. This is how the rider is affected by the setting.

Being a cyclist and in the state he was in would be even worse in the setting he was in, like the heat of California and the rough condition of the path he was on. Being so hot and tired from the difficult hilly trail would be worse with the lack of water supply. The author was severely dehydrated and was on the verge of fainting. If it wasn't so hot the rider would have been in a much better condition.

The cyclist in the article almost died of dehydration and heat stroke and wrote his mishap in a light and humorous way.

In the "Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit" test, the time setting greatly affects the rider during the story. One of the things that affects him throughout the story is that it was a very hot and scorching day. It also ran out of water and there was nothing but desert and poisonous snakes around. Another thing is that when he ran out of water there were no snake heaters just the desert so he started to get very thirsty. In the test it is also stated that he has reached a part where she saw a sign saying " Rough Road Ahead, Do not exceed the posted speed limit so that the road conditions start to become difficult for him. , which was another effect. At the end of the trial he reaches a camp where everything is calm and relaxed, and there is cold water there, it affects him because he feels replenished. All these different characteristics of the frame affected the rider a lot.

There were a number of things that affected cyclists during his trip. First of all, in the old town there was no real water to drink. He therefore had no more water and was going to be thirsty. Plus, it's mid-June in California, it's very hot and the waistline will wear it out pretty quickly. Another thing that has affected the rider is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says “On a long crippling hill,” he says the hills are very difficult for him. These are the characteristics that have affected the cyclist in history.

The setting for this trial was the California desert in June. If any of the characteristics of the settings affected the rider (which they all did), it had the biggest impact. In the fifth paragraph, the reader leaves that the author "was traveling through the high deserts of California in June". My previous knowledge tells me that California is generally always a very hot place especially in the desert in June, the hottest month of the year. This would have greatly affected the cyclist. He drove over fifty miles through the California desert with a limited supply of water. This put him at great risk for dehydration, which he tells the reader he reached in the last time of paragraph ten. This terrain and the extremely hot conditions would make the rider very tired and dehydrated, making his journey to @ CAPS1 @ ORGANIZATION1 all the more difficult.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him any good information, no nearby towns still working, it was a hot summer day, no water nearby. These affected the cyclist as they did not make him sweat, dry mouth, no energy, and he very much doubted that he was not going to make his trip alive. In the story of the cyclist, the cyclist said: 'I picked up some pebbles and put them in my mouth. With my Luer. I had hit a lump and lodged one in my throat. It didn't really matter. I was about to die. When he said that he showed a lot of doubts. Every time he came to a city or a building he was abandoned. He saw an abandoned building that was ironically a Welch's grape juice and bottling plant. It made him even more thirsty. This is how the characteristics affected the rider.

The setting of the story greatly affected the cyclist. The main setting was that he was riding his bike in the desert. The desert is very hot, so he needed more water than he would have if he was riding in the woods or if there was snow. There were also some hills on his trip that he had to ride his bike, which took more energy from him, so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat, well, because of the terrain on which he was on the animals he encountered a snake could have hurt him. Because the setting for the story was in the desert, the cyclist was affected more than he thought.        

<START>

 

In this paragraph I will explain some features of the tuning that affected the rider. One of the effects was the uneven and bumpy roads he was trying to cycle on. If it was flat, he wouldn't really need to be more aware, because with the bumpy roads he has to watch out for rocks, holes in the road. Hills are another effect. He had to deploy more energy than if the hills were just flat. These are a few reasons that explain the characteristics of the frame that affect the rider.

There are some frame characteristics that affect the rider on their journey to Yosemite. Initially, advertising men who haven't seen the changes this world has made in about a decade, gave the rider a bad start. If the cyclist had not obtained the shortcut information, he would not have been without water in the abandoned towns. When the rider arrives at rusty pumps, he decides to check them out and see if there is water. The water really wasn't and tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to continue, even though he ran out of water. When he got to a snake on the ride, he had to overcome his " state of dehydration ". I imagine it would be dangerous if you couldn't concentrate well on the road. He then ran into @ ORGANIZATION1 who did and gave up. There could obviously be no water given the poor condition of the building. When the rider had no water he became dehydrated and unfortunately there was no stopping for water that day until Yosemite.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in many cases, it was like a crazy maze, the road that belonged to him, and the fact that he didn't really know where he was going didn't help, or didn't enough water. This is how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider.

The cyclist's adventure was very marked by its setting. It seemed that the worse his surroundings got, the worse he personally felt. For example, when he hit Ghost Town, he just laughed. When he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of the existing civilizations, and he said, " This sight is disturbing ." Once he has moved forward he is even more discouraged by the "Rough Road Ahead" sign. It seems the more dehydrated he got, the worse things got for him. The climate in history is also becoming @ CAPS1 difficult. At first the terrain was flat and easy to navigate, as it became more difficult to ride a bike the rider became suspicious and delusional @ CAPS1 but knew he had to keep going. The area the cyclist was in had a huge effect on him emotionally.

The characteristics of the scenery affect the cyclist by putting him in a situation of imminent death.

The problem with cyclists in Do not exceed the speed limit posted by "@ PERSON1" is dehydration and the Californian terrain is the cause. California is full of long deserts that can exceed @ NUM1 degrees in the summer, and the rider was going to great lengths to make dehydration inevitable.

The cyclist receives almost a desperation as well as a determination to survive while running out of water. For example, he says, " I was going to lie… slowly gaining altitude losing hope ". The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives. He learns, because the setting is now lifeless and deserted, not to listen to the old people who remember the current setting as they did decades ago. Because the frame features almost kill the rider, the rider learns a lesson.

In the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the frame is a very important factor. The author feels the need to describe the path the rider follows and the details at each place he stops, as in "a dilapidated shed ... rivers of Yosemite ..." In a story like this, this frame is of great importance, especially since it changes so quickly.

The cyclist in the test goes through phases that affect him differently depending on the setting. At the start, the cyclist knows where he is and knows his location very well. He is excited for his race and ready to do it. He then shows up in a "ghost town". He begins to have doubts about what the old men told him. This place was completely deserted and there was no water for it. He started to feel disheartened when he walked past the grape juice factory and seriously believed that it was the end for him. Her hope and joy finally returned to her after seeing the sign of the bait. The feelings and attitudes of bikers have changed as often as the surroundings.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider in several ways. At first, when he sees the tall pines and the river, he is calm: and relaxed. But when he sees the abandoned factory "@ PERSON1's Grape Juice", he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die in the desert. A guy goes to @ ORGANIZATION1 where he meets some "old folks" and gives him a "shortcut" to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park by taking their "shortcut". While traveling, he begins to run out of water and he then thinks that he is going to die in the desert. “It doesn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean. This quote now means that he is in the desert, he thinks he is going to die because he has no more water. It relates to the fact that he is in desperate need of water because he is in the desert in mid-June.

The characteristics may or may not affect the rider very well. I depend on what condition is going on. For example, he might fall. Does he have a travel first aid kit.

The frame is a very important part of the story " Rough Road Ahead, Do not exceed the posted speed limit : by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie has experienced a harsh landscape with high temperatures, a poor water supply, and wildlife. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heat stroke, hyperthermia, dehydration, and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to survive an event like being the last. Dealing with wildlife can also be a barrier. You never know how an animal will react to your presence, so you should be as careful as possible with non-domestic animals. In conclusion, the landscapes and setting of a story can make all the difference in how interesting a story is and how informative it is, for example, if Kurmaskie hadn't known a time with plenty of food and water. through a small flat town at @ LOCATION1 the story wouldn't be so interesting.

The characteristics of the setting greatly affect the rider in " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting affects the speed, force, and time the rider needs to pedal. For example, “ ... Difficult road to travel : do not exceed the posted speed limit. " The rider was traveling at 12 mph where the speed limit was 55 mph. The cyclist was starting to lose hope after reading the sign, but he continued. In addition, the terrain not only added pressure to the rider. The heat of the sun too. For example, the cyclist says: " ... and the growing awareness that I might fall from heat stroke ... ". The heat begins to affect the health of the author and his perseverance. The frame affects the mental and physical strain that the rider must endure.

This story was a big motivator for an older man who can still be healthy and feel like a teenager again. It showed how hard he had put in to achieve his goal and how he survived. Forty miles he peddled for forty miles to drink the same water as the cyclist and interesting story not ginaupup

This affects cycles, as the condition determines the pace and even the speed at which they can travel.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These characteristics have made dehydration a more vivid possibility. Another example is paragraph ten. He explains how the rough road, weeds and the large snake made it difficult for the rider to keep his balance without water. In addition, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice, which caused the rider to think more about the water and become very thirsty. Although there were some positive effects of the setting on the rider. The pebbles out loud to him to keep his mouth moist and not to think too much about his thirst. In addition, the bait purchased allowed him to opt for something to drink and not die of dehydration.          

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. This affects the cyclist in particular because of the weather conditions. Since it is very hot outside, the cyclist does not have enough water. It also affects the cyclist due to the condition along the route. For example tumbleweeds and snakes. Since this is probably not the case, the desert is on the verge of drought and it is very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the rider.      

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider list in several ways. For example, the lack of water was the most important thing. Without fresh water, he had nothing to boost his energy. He would tire more quickly. Even he finds the water hot, like when he says " brackish water smelling somewhere around two hundred degrees ". This shows how in "the high desert of June" the water is very hot. Even after pumping the well for several minutes, the water still did not cool, the hot desert had cooked everything above and below the ground. So when you go for something liquid that heats up and cools faster than solids, it will be hot. In addition, the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to move. We know the roads are rough when he says, “Big road signs threw me over. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED DISPLAYED SPEED LIMIT.” It also shows you couldn't go fast.       

<START>

 

The cyclist is dehydrated. He lacks water for a significant distance before realizing "that the old men would have been right if he had driven", before the last world war. But whatever "city" he went to was just a chunk of ramshackle, deserted, forsaken wilderness. He said, "It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself." @ CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to continue, but "hope was fading." Then all of a sudden, after having climbed a big hill, he finds all hope. He sees " Gary and Wilber's fishing camp ". He's now safe, ready to roll, and dodging all the men who haven't budged from their porch in years.          

<START>

 

The severe adjustment " DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit " Joe made the Kurmaskie @ CAPS1 more difficult for the cyclist because of the hot weather and the inconsistency of the roadway. The very hot day in June caused the cyclist to slow down. "Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day." This proves that the cyclist is very hot because of the summer heat. Another factor slowing down the cyclist is the inconsistency of the pavement on the road "The flat road has been replaced by short hills". The @ CAPS2 proves that the road could also slow down the cyclist. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up, he can get to " Yosemite ".

The characteristics of the scenery affect the cyclist in the heat of the California deserts as the cyclist was sweating and drinking his water bottles. Also, when the cyclist saw the building he thought he could rest and maybe get to where he was going, but the building was abandoned years earlier so the cyclist couldn't stop. These are some of the characteristics of the frame that affect the rider.  

<START>

 

Several characteristics of the setting that affected the rider were the time of year, the desert land, lack of civilization, lack of resources - especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer, which was the hottest time of the year. He also traveled through deserts which create an even hotter climate. “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had traveled on @ DATE2, for example, he @ MONTH1 would have been more comfortable. Throughout his journey, the author did not come after the desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he travels through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He struggles to find a place to get water. This made the trip even more difficult and overwhelming. “I was going to die,” he says. As it travels further, the land also becomes more difficult to navigate. “ The flat road has been replaced by short, rolling hills ” this characteristic is a frame, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey more difficult.              

<START>

 

The surroundings of the cyclists had an effect. In the second paragraph, the rider describes how “ I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening on ”. knew a shortcut. In paragraph @ NUM1, the rider mentions how the elderly men looked at his map and underlined "that windy jaunt". The cyclist just thought his life was a little easier. Then, in paragraph @ NUM2, the cyclist comes across the "traditional definition of a ghost town". came to a kind of fork. “In paragraph @ NUM3, this caused confusion and concern.” The sight was disturbing. "" I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. “The cyclist” was hitting my water bottles fairly regularly. “This setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the“ two hundred degrees. ”The cyclist then started puzzled and distraught. Cyclist was successful.

The frame characteristics of Do not exceed the speed limit posted by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist as the cyclist is in a desert with no water and tries to find a town there further than he thinks. "I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean." This shows that the cyclist did not have much confidence in this desolate area of the jerny.   

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as the road could be damaged or there could be a lot of hills. An example is on the @ NUM1 page "with any luck I would hit a lump and lodge one in my throat". This explains why the road conditions could be dangerous. This is how the state of the road can be emotional.

When the rider hits the road again, he has plenty of water, strong legs and enjoys a sunny, hot day. But as the day gets hotter and the terrain becomes more desert and he coughs, the rider begins to lose confidence, as he continues to ride his water supply runs out and he begins to ride. believe he is going to die. At one point, speaking of the terrain, he said, "I worked hard at one point, the tumbleweeds crossed any path." Looks like he's struggling really hard to keep going with no water and no clue as to where he is. When he is almost sure he is going to die from the questioning he says "I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean". It shows that at this point his confidence was lost due to the insane and unbearable heat. He begins to lose his sanity along with his strength because the setting around him was so terrible.

The characteristics of the settings affect the rider in several ways when he starts, he is bright and happy just as the stillness is pleasant and soothing. There is a rhythm that makes her feel that there is nothing wrong. "I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face." After about @ NUM1 miles in the cold his life was getting low and he came in second abundant. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. "This site was tripling." There he finds an aquatic plant, but his hopes rise a little, until he finds out that the water is not good. "A tarry substance has flowed out, followed by brick water, smelling of one which is in the vicinity of two hundred trees." So he moves on and finally he reaches life! He's so relieved he can't believe his luck. Then as easily as rounding a body, my problems, my thirst and my fear were all behind me.

The characteristics of the setting greatly affect the rider. The way this affects it is that it is very hot and there is no water left in here. Also because there are so many cities almost under construction and ghost, it gives him a haze of cables that he will be able to get water. 

<START>

When you are riding a bicycle or playing outdoor sport, the frame is very important. If it's cold, you need a jacket. Hot, you need water. Depending on the degree of security, it could be life or death. It could be very hilly and you could tire yourself out, and if you don't have water you could die. It also depends if it is in a suburban city, a small town, a desert, a highway, all these factors play a huge role in cycling

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider in a @ CAPS1 manner. The cyclist was in California in June weather. If it wasn't so hot, he wouldn't have needed the water so much. He wouldn't have sweated so much. Also, there were no buildings or cars around, so there was no one to help him. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structures of any kind." The @ CAPS1 characteristics of the setting could affect the rider.

 In the essay " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", written by Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider. One characteristic that affects him is that he cycles "through the high deserts of California in June" (Kurmaskie). This effect would mean that the author would become dehydrated more quickly. The cyclist, author, is dehydrated before being able to reach the neighboring town because he "picked up some stones and put them in [his] mouth" (Kurmaskie).     

<START>

 

In the Do not exceed the speed limit posted by Joe Kurmaskie test, the surrounding environment affected the rider. The setting was somewhere outside of Lodi, Calif., In early summer. The cyclist followed the advice of some old men who led him to difficult places from which to get out. As the sun made things better and its water started to run out, it was much more difficult to get to Yosemite. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. When the terrain began to change from a flat road to hills, the rider pushed even harder to reach his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrate it more quickly. After riding " along a paralyzing hill ", the cyclist had to stop and even tried to suck on a stone to stop thinking about his thirst. When he found a manned store, he was exhausted and relieved. a great effect on the cyclist: time dehydrates him while the terrain exhausts him.              

<START>

 

The parameters of the test affected the rider mentally and physically. The fact that it was crossing the desert in June affected the duration of its water supply. If he had driven in the @ DATE1, his water supply would have lasted longer and he would have had more energy. Since the town that the old men told the cyclist about was abandoned, which also affected the cyclist as he had to continue even if he got weaker. What touched the rider the most, I think, was when he got to the bait shop. If this had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would have died. Fortunately, it was not and he was able to drink water. The factory affected him mentally because the boy's photo haunted him in a way, because he was drinking juice, which the cyclist couldn't do. Overall I think the conditions the rider was in affected him. Ever since I passed out from dehydration before knowing what it feels like to be without water. First, you have a headache ; then your mouth dries up and despair sets in and finally you feel dizzy.          

<START>

 

The setting in " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit " @ CAPS1 the physical and mental condition of the cyclist. There are negative and positive effects for every condition. The physical effects of the rider due to the settings are all apparent throughout history. For example, the cyclist reaches the Fish Camp of @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1, he can hydrate again. The positive effect makes the rider healthy and safe again. The mental adjustment, @ CAPS1 the cyclist very substantially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around @ LOCATION1. He feels good about it. This positive effect prepares the cyclist for a trip to Yosemite. Also, when the rider reaches the "Ramshackle @ CAPS2, several rusty pumps and a corral", he feels confused. He is mentally negatively affected by the low amount of water available. In addition, the cyclist felt "sad" and "hopeless" when cycling on dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state there. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling saying that his problems are now "behind" him. The positive effect of the parameters in this case changes the mental state from negative to positive. The parameter was the main factor in deciding the physical and mental state of the cyclist. Parameter @ CAPS1 the physical and mental state of the cyclist in positive and mental states almost equally in history.               

<START>

 

Its setting made the rider feel lonely. The cyclist quickly lost hope as she never saw anyone or water on the path. The cyclist said he saw a "ghost town". Before arriving at the fishing camp, the cyclist did not see anyone and became dehydrated. It made him lose hope and at times he thought he was going to die. For example, he said, "I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean." " It is clear that the context has affected the cyclist very negatively.      

<START>

 

The characteristics of the scenery affect the cyclist because he was in a forest. It was a bumpy journey with a lot of issues along the way. It was along the journey. But he made it tough with a story to tell at the end.

The framework of the test, "Rough Road Ahead: Not exceeding the posted speed limit" affects the physical and emotional attitude of cyclists. At the start of the test, the cyclist "rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face". It wasn't too hot in the morning yet. Thus, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was convinced that he could conquer everything. As the day progressed, "the sun began to strike." He was starting to drink a lot of water but he was still confident and strong. “I arrived in a dilapidated shed [and] several rusty pumps, the view was disturbing. “The cyclist was traveling through the hot deserts of California. He was getting tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident desert ride has turned into a survival ride. Once the cyclist finds water, he is relieved. He feels more confident and can drive to his destination. The weather and the setting can affect us emotionally and physically, just like in the test the rider fatigued both physically and emotionally as the hot sunny day wore on.             

<START>

 

As the rider begins his journey, he is confident and excited to have been offered new directions from "old wise men" who promise a shortcut. This water supply is poor and his attitude is desired against flat, hilly terrain, until he realizes that the directions are far from the target. The cyclist was heading towards Yosemite when he arrived at the first "town", but it was not a town but rather a ghost dwelling. As he continued to hope that the shortcut offered by the ancient " codgens " would actually materialize, he realized he was completely alone in the hot desert with a draining water supply and a declining spirit. He was troubled that he had chosen to take the advice of older men and, through his pain and despair, encouraged himself by deciding that he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt overwhelmed, but thanks to his willpower and determination, by rationing the water and choosing mentally to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physical, emotional and mental trials and lived for learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old "codgers" on mapping problems, because their information would most likely be out of date.         

<START>

 

Proponents of the parameter affected the cycling is that the warmer, it was the more water it has drunk. Also the more he travled the more tired he got which made him hotter and which caused him to drink more of his water.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider in his determined race. At first he seemed comfortable talking about the cool pines and rushing rivers he would encounter once he got to Yosemite. After an arduous run, he started to get nervous and wondered if he was even going to survive. He was running out of water and he thought he was a Diamondback. Once he reached the hills he saw a speed limit sign not to exceed the 55 mph speed limit. At the end of the hills, he came to a former Welch grape factory, wondering if his life was so cruel. After that, he was determined to survive and reach his destination. He spotted rays on the horizon and joined them across the desert. He has finally reached the "Only and Wilbers" fishing camp where he knows he is safe and will survive.        

<START>

 

The hot, dry and baronial environment greatly affects the rider. Baron is a hot, dry, abandoned place. The cyclist tries to cycle to Yosemite National Park. He decides to follow the instructions of the old coaple, which was a mistake. "... Simply because I listened to gentlemen who had not stepped out of their porch for decades" (Kurmaskie). The hot, dry conditions made it the most difficult obstacle for cyclists to stay hydrated.    

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. One way was because of the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. The rider with a limited amount of water did so. The cyclist was listening to the old men so he rode a good distance. So that made it bad. For lack of water with such a distance to cover, the cyclist stuffed pebbles in his mouth, hoping to forget his thirst. The cyclist thought he was dying and the birds were picking him up clean, because he thought he was going to die of dehydration. The road conditions made things more difficult, at first he started with nothing but straight roads and then ended up going up and down the hill. In conclusion, the cyclist encountered many obstacles which made his journey more difficult than he thought.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider as the setting so you won't, much on the hills. There was also no water. For example, in the story he tells, it was a hilly area. He also says that there is no building, he is all alone which scares him @ MONTH1. Thus, the frame affects the cyclist being a very hot dry climate without water and without building; and no one to ask for directions would make him scared and lost and fearful of what is going to happen to him.     

<START>

 

During the cycling trip he encountered many ?? ??. Especially the driver ?? and out of the water. In the essay it is told how he got to the first city and was in search of water. He said, "This place could have been a prosperous little place at one point, say, before the last world war." This affected the cyclist because he lacked water. Another feature of the setting that affected the rider was heatstroke, and not a single car or building along the way.       

<START>

 

The peculiarity of the frame affected the rider due to the poor road conditions and no sun and desserts and the low amount of energy he left behind the reasons why 

<START>

 

As if a bike ride through town weren't exhausting enough, the author of this story got a lot worse. First, the climate was a recipe for disaster. "High deserts of California in June." @ CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor, as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the rider did not have the correct gean, he could be injured by these three factors. Second, " the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills ." @ CAPS2 his endurance is tested because it targets the energy of tolerance and will allow each individual hill to be climbed. More importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. In a desert, water is nowhere to be found. In hot weather, water bottles get hot and in the sun the water can even evaporate. To me it seems the setting and the weather were the perfect combination to do a lot more harm than good.            

<START>

 

The characteristic that affects the cyclist is the lack of water that it slows down. Another is the old man's instructions which are probably not up to date these days. 

<START>

 

The decor explains an early summer evening with a few eccentric men. The mood he would be in would probably be lively. "Like a young fool, the next morning I took their advice ..." (Kurmaskie) said if you were very keen I would take that as a way to be drunk without being drunk, and to do whatever someone thinks you should do it without knowing you are being persuaded to do it.  

<START>

 

The adjustment causes difficult problems for the rider and difficult dangers. The weather is hot and the hot weather is hard enough, but walking through a desert with little water must have been miserable. The heat of the desert had an effect on the cyclist and caused him fatigue. It also delayed him to reach his destination faster. Not only did he have to face difficult weather conditions, but also dangerous conditions. There were times when "weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake." It delayed him and took a while to get around. As you can see, it was a difficult journey for the reader and cyclist concerned.       

<START>

 

The characteristics that surround the rider greatly affect him. All he has around him are hills, rough terrain, sand + weeds. These characteristics make him think he is going to die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + lively + that's how it feels. The old rusty water pump shows it hasn't been used in ages + the black tar pumped out doesn't help her negative thought of life.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. Ranging from temperature, environment and water availability. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted due to the temperature and the terrain. For example, “ I was traveling to the high deserts of California in June ”. I can imagine the cruelty of the heat that descends on him as he rolls on the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted too. Second, the environment while he was riding affected him and made him less confident the further he was riding. For example, " This place may have been a little prosperous time, say, before the last world war, that morning it met the traditional definition of a ghost town." " This shows how the information he gave led him to not knowing where he was going. I would feel incapable and do the same in his situation. Finally, the lack of water scared him. For example, “ conserve my water and instead be away for at least about an hour from my inner spirit ”. It made him think the situation was not good. So, as can be seen, it affected the rider in several ways.

In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the author uses the characteristics of the frame to show the effects of the cyclist. In the test, the rider receives instructions from two old men on a perch. In the essay, he said, "Never accept the braiding advice of a group of elders who have not left their porch centers since Carter was in office." “It shows that the old man can be wrong and places can change. In addition, on this shortcut, there is almost a lack of water. The essay stated that I would conserve my water and go inside for an hour or two - a test of my inner spirit. He lacks water but has the determination to arrive at @ CAPS1 last, the terrain affects him. The hills prove to be a challenge with a limited water supply. The test indicates. The flat roads were covered with rolling hills and hills. This shows that he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle, he managed to pull through. This is how the author used the features of the frame to add to the rider's struggle.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider because they thought they were old enough and saw what was going on and went through this situation that they were well experienced and knew more about what was going on so people should listen to them.

After the cyclist spoke to the "elders who had not left the confines of their porches since Carter had been in power," his confidence began to crumble. He entered the wilderness happy, hopeful and determined. As his water tank began to disappear and he approached the sight of the old shed, the canal, and a water pump, he began to feel touched. He tried to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and " tested like battery acid ." As he continued, his confidence only faded. He traveled through the wilderness and the "ridiculously big serpent" and ran out of water. Finally, he saw a building in the distance, which ironically illuminated an abandoned juice factory, a sign with a left sipping on a crumbling frozen succulent liquid, and he began to lose hope. He didn't think he would arrive at his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he stumbled upon a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example, the characteristics of the " rough road " did not allow him to arrive that fast, so he was driving @ NUM1 at a speed limit @ NUM2. Second, the fact that he was driving through a desert, a large snake made its way through the road, forcing the man to "go smoothly, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." @ CAPS1 again because he was driving through the desert he got so hot and started to get dehydrated from the lack of water. Finally, the characteristics that there were no buildings for miles away, so he was lost and had nowhere to stop and ask directions. These few characteristics definitely affected the cyclist.

There were many characteristics of the setting that affect the cyclist to make his trip to Yosemite difficult. First, they are the old people of the reservoir campsite. They may have been old, but not very wise. For example, “ I took their advice and went on the front line, and took a ' shortcut ' that cut me hours of travel to Yosemite National Park. " This describes how the rider takes the shortcut old who does almost kill @ CAPS1, the sun has had a warming effect on the rider, making dehydrate. For example, " I had knocked my water bottles fairly regularly and was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ." This shows you a picture of the heat of the climate it is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heat stroke or dehydration, which can lead to death. For example, “ I could have heatstroke on a beautiful June day… ” This means that without enough water to keep him cool, he felt like he was going to die.

In the story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the setting often affects the character. An example of this is when the character arrived at a place where there was nothing. “A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that could not contain the most crappy mule greeted me. This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was confused. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in its bottle smells like NUM1 degrees. "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." This quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. Another example of a setting is the change of terrain. "Road @ CAPS1 has been replaced by short rolling hills." This forced the rider to work harder and use more energy. All these conditions forced the cyclist to work harder to find his destination.

The parameter “ Rough Road Ahead : do not exceed the posted speed limit ” greatly affected the rider. For starters, it is said that he "traveled through high desserts", which is never a sure thing. He drank water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was "trying to keep my balance in my dehydration state." For lack of water because the land had altered its water into "a very similar substance". The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.

Conditions and characteristics affect everything about the rider. The conditions were that, he had to save as much water as possible and stay hydrated at the same time so that he did not become dehydrated. The features of the desert like the land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, not to mention that there were creatures like snakes roaming around there. You can never predict what they are going to do.

The characteristics of the story setting affect the rider in several ways. For example, when he arrived in the first town, the water tasted like battery acid, which led the rider to think that the water was different with the harsh conditions such as temperature. The merry-go-round listened to the old people trying to get to where it was going faster.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. One characteristic would be the dryness of the land. He cycled for so long that he became dehydrated, yet there wasn't a drop of water because he didn't know how long and he didn't think he could go that far. Another feature of the setting was the warmth. He felt like he couldn't go on because the hot sun made him want to have heatstroke. Obviously, the characteristics of the frame had a huge impact on the rider.

During the cyclist's journey, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rugged terrain, animals, and isolation all contributed to her strain while completing her difficult task. His isolation as he descended the "shortcut" was a sure factor in his tension. @ PERSON1 stated that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. " Everything whereupon @ PERSON1 should focus was to perform its task. There was no one nearby to help him and there was no shelter to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant role in Kurmaskie's physical exertion. The heat made him dangerously thirsty and forced him to quickly find plenty of water. Kurmaskie said: " The growing awareness that I could fall from heat stroke " This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rugged terrain and the snake and two factors in his journey that helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical effort of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and dangerous terrain simply puts it in a more gradual position.

In Joe Kurmaskie's article, " Do not exceed posted speed limit ," the characteristics of the setting affect the rider in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and the lack of water. “I calmed down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. "This sentence of the text indicates that he is dehydrated, because of this, it creates an obstacle that he has to face. In addition, another bad effect of the characteristics of the frame that the cyclist faces is the rough road that he faces. had to face. "ROUTE TO TAKE: DO NOT EXCEED THE DISPLAYED SPEED LIMIT. " If I was the rider who watched the panel, I would die just knowing that there were problems devant.Heureusement, the cyclist has pioneered and has managed its obstacles.

There are a lot of features in the frame that will affect riders. One characteristic is the climate. When you are riding a bike and it is really hot, you can get dehydrated very quickly. If it is really cold, it is more difficult to breathe and catch your breath. Another characteristic of the frame that can affect a rider is the terrain. If there are too many really steep hills you will tire quickly and when it is rocky you have the possibility of falling off the bike and injuring yourself. The last characteristic of the frame that will affect a cyclist is the isolation from the road. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, it could be almost fatal for a cyclist. Also, if the road is so lonely and you get injured, who would find you. This is another fatal situation. These are the main characteristics of the frame that can affect the rider.

The features of the scenery affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. The setting had a scorching sun, no trees and no water. The cyclist also felt less. In the story he said "Me and the growth ??? : ??? That I could fall from heatstroke.     

<START>

 

The surroundings were hot and dry which affected the rider a lot. She did not have enough space to carry much water and a cane to make portrons to drink. Also listening to old people who didn't know much didn't help either and sent her down a much harder path to walk.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. The first was the cool wooded road he had taken. Since the heart was not easy, he felt confident and started the end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he was riding in the wilderness. The rider was starting to get dehydrated and what little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist giving him false hopes and almost led to his death.     

<START>

 

The way the frame of the story helps the guy a lot. It was rolling and hot but with "cool pines and a river of risum" it was worth the trip. This keeps him cool so he can get wet in the next town. This is why I think the pine and the river have been a great help.   

<START>

 

Whether the lack of water, hills, weeds fall - all are things that affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water. Hills also affect it because it is difficult to climb hills. Finally, it's the tumbleweeds. The wild grasses show a distinct desert aspect. When he sees weeds falling he tries to keep his balance as he is partially dehydrated and does not want to crash. Dehydration / lack of water affects the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive. When you run out of water and energy, it makes it harder to reach your goal.        

<START>

 

In "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics of the frame affect the cyclist by gradually wearing it down and pushing the limits of hope and survival. At first the cyclist enters a deserted town but remains calm and amused by this sentence: “I laughed, checked my water supply and moved (@ NUM1). Shortly after, the cyclist is troubled by a "dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June" (@ NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a major dent in his water supply and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and irreparably lost, the cyclist tries to keep hope but soon breaks down. He reflects : " By telling myself that I could go this far, I would be @ NUM3). The frame characteristics become more and more disappointed with every step of the way for the rider.        

<START>

 

At the start of the cycle route, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist arrives at the first deserted town whose scenery is not described because the cyclist is not yet worried. After leaving the first town, the cyclist barely noticed the heat as “ the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them ”. The cyclist is always in good spirits. The cyclist begins to feel thirsty when he runs into a water pump. He tries to get water, but the pump is not working. Up to this point in history, the road has been mostly flat and straight. The cyclist then notices that the road has hills. At this point the rider has no water and is very dehydrated. After a hill, the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic given the condition the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of life when he runs into a fishing camp. He takes the water from the bathroom and everything is fine. The setting of this story affects the rider because as the setting changes, the rider's mood and feelings about survival and the danger they find themselves in also change.

The characteristic of the frame affects the rider in several ways. When in the test it says, " The sun was starting to hit " This shows that it affects the way he feels when he is cycling on the road and it may affect his ability to continue cycling for. the sun ??? him hard. In addition, when he states "I was racing at 20 km / h exhausting the water" it shows that he was also dehydrated once he left, very slowly due to the amount of heat and the lack of water. that affected his ability to continue cycling in the area.     

<START>

 

I believe the cyclist is one, and I think the old man should have shot him. I think such a long bike ride is a bit delayed. I think no matter how awesome or how awful you are, you should even be riding a bike with a really long rider.  

<START>

 

The frame affected the rider a lot during his ride. The temperature being so hot tires the cyclist and makes him thirsty. Also, with the hills being so high to climb, it was difficult to continue. Since he was in the wilderness, there weren't many towns to go to. All of these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.    

<START>

 

The definition of the test "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit" in three ways. One way is that he is very naked so there is no shade to stop the sun hitting the rider's body which adds to his dehydration and lack of concentration. Another way the setting affects the rider is terrain, rolling hills and desert, cycling through hills makes him work harder using more energy and exuding his power the desert also with the heat. of his enemies makes him not trust himself thinks he mirages he sees. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns when he sees them, he is hoping to be relieved that he can have water and heat, but when he passes he finds nothing and leaves him sheepish and thinks of death.   

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because, it is hot and dry in the California desert when you are cycling, hot and dry with bad directions, and in a desert it is bad. It was a long distance, under the scorching sun, with little water, and he thought he was going to die because there was nothing insightful. 

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in more than one way. For example, in the short story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the cyclist had to put up with crossing big hills while being dehydrated and tired after having covered miles and miles to get to his destination. The setting can sometimes even make you lose hope and give up. The cyclist in the news; started to lose hope until he found a store that sold fishing bait. The setting controls how long it takes you to reach your destination and how you get there. For example, if you come across a dirt road and there is a large boulder in the way, you have to find another way to get there. In conclusion, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways.

The scenery affects the cyclist as he is in the California desert in June without water. He also cycles back and forth on hilly curry back roads. The cyclist eventually begins to lose water and his resolve is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says that "large rings of dried candy circled my shirt and the growing awareness that I could have heatstroke on a beautiful June day just because I was listening to old gentlemen who hadn't gone out. from their porch for decades. Made me laugh. The author shows how the circumstances in which he finds himself weighs him down. It also reads a road sign "Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit." It's ironic because he's already exhausted and now he's about to hit a dangerous stretch of road. I have never ridden a bike for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed into such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to once when I played @ NUM1 football games in the summer heat. It was painful and every time I got the ball I needed everything I had to kick it.          

<START>

 

In the story, the characteristics of the decor affect it because it lacked water. He also had to maneuver around a snake. It made him tired and dehydrated. His muscles were aching from the rough terrain. He became dehydrated from the sun.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways as it is almost like the background and theme of the rider. The features used in this story mostly relate to the background it goes to and the sites it is in. He shows the reader how much he needs to go somewhere and also now he is in despair at the time. When he said "It was a sad, desperate laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself." In this quote he says he @ MOIS1 is tired and physically not in his best shape but at least he knows he is not in good shape and he knows he is in trouble but he can still be. laugh and be aware of it but he keeps trying anyway. This text, in my opinion, shows many different ideas such as hope, awareness, ability and courage to realize that you need help, but go ahead anyway to prove to yourself that you can finish what you want. wanted and planned to do.    

<START>

 

The characteristics of the decor affect the cyclist because it is a dessert. The dessert is very hot. I know this because in the story he states he feels around @ NUM1 degrees. He struggled for the water but couldn't find any that was fresh. He found a water pump that had " a tar-like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water smelling somewhere in the vicinity of two hundred degrees ". This means it was hot and he couldn't find water.       

<START>

 

There are many dangers and harsh characteristics that affect the rider. He begins his journey on the advice of an old man's shortcut. The rider is very excited about a shortcut and efficiently drinks his water. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to hit him. He takes the pressure thinking of the cold stress of @ CAPS1 and is then not disturbed by the sun even the imaginary setting of a fictitious stream had an effect on the rider. Soon the sun begins to hit him even more. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure that the snitch he meets is not a mirage. When he crossed the bend he gave way to trouble and thirst       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. The rider persevered over the rough terrain, weakening him. For example, the author states “ looked at most of the sidewalk in front of me and stopped plowing to keep my balance in my dehydrated state ”. This shows that the author is dehydrated because it is very hot and he continued even with a physical obstacle. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the ground was too hard. For example, in the text, "It didn't really matter, I was going to die and the birds will clearly choose me by waving only a few outdoor gear." This shows that the author had to go again even when times are tough. The text shows how exhausted he is from the winds that gnaw at him when he dies. He would become dehydrated from the humidity of the desert and the heat. In other words, the characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways.           

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because if you go down a hill and then take a rough road, you won't do so well. Like for example it was going over flat ground and then it eventually turned into hills into a rough road. These conditions could seriously injure someone.  

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in different ways. When the cyclist found the city gohst since no one was there he couldn't ask someone for better directions or get food or water. The short rolling hills make pedaling more difficult as it is difficult to pedal uphill. At the end of the story, he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction.   

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the frame by all the large hills and all the roughness of the roads. As the essay says, “ the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. After going through the first of them, a big freeway sigh jumped over me, ”pretty much what it says is that the flat road quickly turned into hills. If I was the cyclist going up the hills, my legs would get very tired and sore after a while. For example when my friend @ PERSON1 and I went for a bike ride we went to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 in fechmisburg and we had to go up a big hill so after a few pedals our legs started to hurt , so we decided to walk up the hill.

There are many ways the setting of “ Rough Road ahead ” affects the rider. First of all, he rides a bicycle in the desert. This is a problem because it is very dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he "was trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state". It is evident here that the lack of water greatly affects his. He almost collapsed because he was so thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that they are in a very remote area. He says that “there was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. Since there was traffic now, the cyclist had to keep riding his bike and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop. Finally, the "bumpy road" affected the cyclist. The road made travel even more difficult and caused very difficult times for the cyclist. If I had to ride a bike for a long time, I would much prefer to have a smooth road so that I could renew my energy. The heat, remoteness of the area, and the rough road all affected the rider on his trip.

The characteristics of the decor greatly affect the cyclist in the story. The list of desert climate stories damages the cyclist by rapidly depleting their water supply. He also began to worry when every town the old men spoke of turned out to be a ghost town. This raised doubts in the cyclist's mind that he might not survive the " short cut " announced by the old men.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as there are different types of hills. He paid attention to the rocks in the middle of the road. He needs to make sure he has plenty of water because it looks like he's in the desert. There are no cars around but he still has to look for cars in case they come out of nowhere. There are a lot of turns. It's very hot, so he needs to make sure he doesn't have a good scaoke. There are no places he can stop because there is no shade. There are also no stores where he can stop and get food and water. This is the frame of the cyclist.

@ CAPS1 the history of the condition of the problem has often affected the mood of the rider. For example, when the sign says “ Bumpy road ahead : do not exceed the posted speed limit. " @ CAPS1 this time, he saw a snake he was afraid, so he calmed down in trying to keep the balance while he was dehydrated. The dry and hot climate started to become a problem for the cyclist.

Then, as he progressed on his journey, he came across a sign that read " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the speed limit " (Joe Kurmaskie pg @ NUM1) This part of his journey has it made it very difficult by making it tackle rough roads and mountains. that he had to cross which sucked water from him. Then, as he climbed the last mountain, he saw a sign for a garter store. So when he got there he took some water and got directions for a man who had the best map.

When the terrain begins to change, he writes, “ sometimes life can seem so cruel, ” he becomes desperate as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes his old juice factory, he becomes bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope.

The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours of the ride the terrain turned into " short, rolling hills ," which would have made pedaling harder, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mentioned how the sun was hitting him, and that would also serve as a factor that would have helped to deplete his hydration. Despite all the issues the rider has faced, he has managed to stay determined, while others facing his issues may not have been able to pull through.

The land has changed from flat land to short hills. The road had been abandoned as well as the town he had passed through in the hope of having water. The man will say, "I worked hard, at one point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake - it really looked like a diamond back - blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me" (Rough Road Ahead).

For example, the text reads : "The water bottles only contained a few tempting sips, large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day. . " @ CAPS1, using a vocabulary such as "tentalizing" expresses the cyclist's need for water.

In the story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit. Their many characteristics have affected the rider. For example, “ The sun was starting to strike. " They began to have hot, tired. That when it came to all the bumps in the road, it was harder to pedal. He was also drinking hard from his water bottle. This therefore means that he is hot, that he is tired and that he gets lost " I got on all fours while working the handle of the rusty water pump with all my strength " This tells us that he is working too hard, that it will be exhausted to ride. These are the reasons why the characteristics affected the rider.

First, old people affect the cyclist by derailing him. They do this by telling him about a "shortcut" that will take him directly to his destination. Then the cyclist was confronted with the rugged hills of a highway. During his long journey, the cyclist has always remained determined to reach his destination.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. If the cyclist was cycling at @ LOCATION1 in mid-June, he wouldn't be so dehydrated. This biker rides in the high deserts of California reaching @ NUM1 ° degrees. In the middle of @ DATE2 in @ CAPS1.A, it barely reaches @ NUM2 ° degrees. Also the desert is known to have nothing. If he drove elsewhere every mile, there might be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in " No @ CAPS2's @ CAPS3 ". Finally, the roads in the desert are much more dangerous because people never really drive, nobody really complains about potholes and other stuff on a regular basis. They are more worried about cities where a lot of people travel, there is no point in changing or filling potholes where no one really travels.          

<START>

 

The tuning really takes the determination off the rider. They were hills that made his journey difficult. It is written: “Above a long overwhelming hill, a building appeared. " This shows that the hills were hard for him because he said they were long and crippling. Another thing in the frame was the building. He was extremely thirsty and went to an abandoned grape juice factory, he said, "judging by the appearance of a grape juice factory @ CAPS1 and a bottling factory." These were just two of many examples of the environment affecting the cyclist.      

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame have a major effect on the rider. It is very hot and it is in a California desert with a limited water supply. It is getting very hot and her water supply is starting to dwindle rapidly. The old men who he said "haven't left their porch since @ PERSON1 was on duty" gave him very bad directions for Yosemite and he ended up getting lost in a hot California desert. He eventually arrived at a tackle shop where he refreshed himself with plenty of water from the sink, then left for Yosemite.    

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect cyclists greatly, as the roads contained bottles that could have really hurt him. In addition, the water he was drinking dripped and tasted like battery acid. Then came some hills which would be another big challenge for him. The frame was quite baron for the cyclist because he also crossed a snake. Finally, he thought he saw mirages that tell me that the climate is extreme for cyclists. This is how the setting affects cyclists.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider for several reasons. One of the reasons is that it makes it easier to imagine what the cyclist is feeling. In addition, it gives the impression that the cyclist is a little crazy to do what he is doing in weather that he could " fall from a heat stroke ". The reason for @ CAPS1 is that the weather affects the rider so much that he sees the mirage of an "abandoned building years ago". The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as the conditions seem impossible to overcome.      

<START>

 

Throughout history, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh tarrens of the Midwest in his quest to find a source of water. He notes several times about the nice @ DATE1, listening to him, quickly warms up in the sweltering heat as he pedals. It also explains in detail the change from flat terrain to hills on its journey. Behind these aspects, the use of the bicycle is much more orderly final for the cyclist and gives the reader a picture of what he is going through.

In the article " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the characteristics of the setting had detrimental consequences for the rider in many ways. First of all, the whole setting was a dry, dusty desert that anyone could preside over. “ The sun was starting to strike, but I hardly noticed it. " The clean affected the cyclist in the desiccant so, which brings me to the next point. “ I knocked out my water bottles quite regularly and traveled through the high deserts of California in June. It made him even more dehydrated, which made him think he was going to die. Along the way, he found an old abandoned juice factory. It affected him by filling him with hopelessness and despair, causing him to grow more and more to reach the water. In the end, the peculiarity of the scenery only made him more determined to hit the water.             

<START>

 

The setting affected the rider in several ways, including the weather. In the story it was written “ I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ” (kermaskie @ NUM1). It's a quote that says he's in a desert and the desert is generally hot. He also said that June and June is generally a hot temperature month. The weather affected the rider as it was hot and he started to get dehydrated and had little water. Another way the frame affected the rider was the environment. In the story, it is said. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind" (kurmaskie). This saying, there is one to help him, so if he gets hurt or something. Also, there is no place to find water.           

<START>

 

Many characteristics of the frame affect the rider. The most obvious and straightforward feature would be that this adventure took place in the "high deserts of California in June". @ CAPS1 about this passage says scorching heat; high, which means it's going to be closer to the sun, the deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be foggy, and June, which is midsummer. Also, the water supply to the closets was "somewhere around two hundred degrees", there was a "long crippling hill" as the sun warmed up. All this would most obviously affect cyclists by tiring him, which he explains vividly by expressing his fears of losing consciousness.      

<START>

 

In Joe Kurmaskie's story “ Don't exceed the posted speed limit ”, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider. An example is when the cyclist says "I noticed the terrain was changing, the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills". This affects the rider as it makes them work hard when they are dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. This makes his muscles work harder and uses more of his strength. In summer it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is riding a bicycle it is very hot, he says "... around two hundred degrees." After this quote he explains how difficult it is to be restless and there is no cold water. This prevents the rider from thinking about the water and not worrying about where he is, he could get lost. He didn't have a good card.          

<START>

 

As the cyclist continues his journey, he meets many sad places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldn't have trusted but did anyway. It took him through the desert. Even by car, the desert can be a very desperate place. On a bike, it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water, one will be there to save you from dehydration. Only the infinitely dark landscapes also played a role in the feelings of cyclists. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandoned towns and bad water. Every time he thought he was saved, he was dejected again by this fact. For example, he had to pump for a few minutes to get bad tasting water. Finally, just when his strength was to give he found the bait and the water and that spectacularly and a place to rest too bad there was another old man out there, no isn't it ?!         

<START>

 

In the essay, the cyclist's features affect the frame because readers wouldn't have thought he was in such great danger if he hadn't walked through the desert. When the cyclist arrived at the grape factory, he said he was almost dehydrated. And then when he got to the bait shop, he was drinking from the tap.  

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider by its rolling hills which went up and down with great force and also it barely had any water because it was so hot that he continued to drink and ran out of water early. In the story it is said as he drove, “ He barely noticed that the sun was starting to hit. " This quote shows that it was getting hot. Also, in the story he says " I checked my water supply ". @ CAPS1 means he's starting to realize that his waters are lacking. So the whole frame is hot abandoned and there is no water source, so the rider is affected by it all

THE FRAMEWORK WAS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN HISTORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT LACK OF WATER. AND I WAS ON A DANGEROUS BIKE. BECAUSE YOU USE YOUR FEET TO MOVE THAT TAKES ENERGY AND USING WATER YOUR BODY.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. The indications given to the cyclist by the elderly were incorrect and he got lost. The lack of water led to the possibility of sucking stones to forget his thirst. The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy. These were the effects the frame had on the rider.

In the story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist went for a bike ride in the heat of summer in California where he will stay, he met old people who gave him a "shortcut". As he finds out, most of the places he was told about were abandoned ghost towns without a single drop of drinking water. If he was in a different place, like by a river or a spring, he would just stop and drink it. Or even if he was in a more populated and industrialized area, he could stop in any building and ask for a drink; But he was in the dry, hot, waterless hills of California, waterless. Under these conditions, he became tired, thirsty; dehydrated; and desperate for a drink finally he came upon a bait shop that had water there

During rider @ CAPS1, he was frequently affected by the adjustment. When he was riding his bike it was very hot for him, but at first it wasn't that bad. "The sun was starting to beat, but I barely noticed it." This proves that the rider knows it was hot but that it did not affect him. Another thing that affected him was the time he was traveling. "I regularly banged my water bottles and traveled through the Hauts Dezerts in California in June." This proves that the reader was drinking constantly due to the time of day and year he was away. All of this shows that the setting affected the rider on his @ CAPS2.

I think the characteristics of the frame really affect the way someone rides a bike because some places have a certain terrain. Some types are not always good for a cyclist because if they are bumpy someone could fall off the bike. Also if it is dark you can't even see where you are going @ MONTH1 you could be seriously injured. This is why riding a bicycle is dangerous. Also, if you are in the type of environment where everything is going well then you @ MOIS1 will be able to have a nice bike ride.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider in " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ". By changing it physically. He was in the California desert in mid-June with no more water. It was wreaking physical havoc on him. His physical effect also made him desperate. He said, "It was a sad, desperate laugh, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself." So, the way he was suffering from dehydration physically affected his emotional state because he felt like there was nothing that could be done. If he had been in another place, say @ LOCATION2, where there is no new gunshot like in California, he would not have suffered from dehydration, as there has been in such a secluded place. His cycling could be compared to mountaineers who got lost in the snowstorm at @ LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat, however, they suffered from hypothermia. If they had been on another mountain, there wouldn't have been a snowstorm and everything would be fine. the outcome of this story and the climbers were determined by their surroundings.

The conditions gave the rider no hope at times because the heat of the earth and the characteristics of the frame were so harsh that he had no hope like when the rider says I hope I get to the horizon because there is nothing else to compare. He can't say let's go to the next building or the mailbox because there isn't one. The characteristics of the desert make the cyclist think that it is just him, no one can help him, he will die of dehydration. Then the characteristics worsen, he sees the welch grapefruit fruit giving him little hope of survival, then he finds out it's deserted and it's like the last thing he gives up. The almost unconscious cyclist then rushes into the fishing store where he takes a sip of water. The characteristics were therefore the main reason why the rider gave up hope.

The betting lines affect the author as it moves him dehydrated. The dessert sun seemed to make him sweat and he had no water to bring to replace his electrolites. Also, once the author got into the hills, he had lost a lot of his energy, so bringing his back up was a lot of work. If I were the author, I would have also tired because you need water in your body to survive.

The characteristics of the setting in " Difficult road: do not exceed the posted speed limit " considerably affect the rider. In the opinion of cyclists, things have started quite well. He had a positive attitude as he says "with strong legs and a smile on my face". As the man advances, he comes to some kind of fort. For him, the spectacle was disturbing. Although unsettling, he still had the confidence that he could go on. Then he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained that “ the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills. " That means it should pedal harder and with more force when crossing the hills. The weather was not right and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heat stroke came to my mind. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind," said the man. His mind entered a state of sad and desperate thoughts, but he persevered and continued to pedal. At this point he was very thirsty and felt that his death was near. He said, “ I was going to die and the birds would pick me up. ” As he continued, he saw an old man in sight. He regained hope and moved on. The characteristics of this story affected the cyclist both physically and mentally. Physically, he was tired and exhausted. Like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamous about his trip. The characteristics of the frame interfered with the physical and mental state of the cyclist.

In this story, "No. Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, I think the adjustment greatly affects the cyclist. I believe it because when it's a long downhill cool roads are fine, but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot it feels like he can't keep pedaling. The rider gets very tired when the scenery is in the hot desert with no one around, so the scenery has a huge effect on the mood in this story. Another example   

<START>

 

A cyclist is a cyclist. They can be in groups of different people or they can be solo cyclists. Some cyclists cycle a few miles, some can go farther like @ NUM1 miles, some go over hills, go to the water, they do a lot with what they do. They have plenty of time to cycle this far.

The setting is hot like the desert, no one around, and very dry. Being warm outside affects the cyclist as he sweats and needs water. The heat tires him out. Having no one around him, he does not receive the water he needs for his trip. These things make him week and make it more difficult for him to find a place to get his water.

In this tale of a cyclist, riding in California, and handed over for Yosemite National Park, he encounters a lack of water and bad directions from a group of old men on a pourch. The setting plays a big part in his "challenge", from the pines to the arid hills. At the start of his essay, he walks past a "gbost town" which has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that " had my name written on it ". It gives him hope and comfort. Then the rusty pump and the "dilapidated shed". They took away hope and reassurance, making him cautious. The hills that made him work hard to get over it, the snake that slowed him down, and the whelches juice company that was plentiful didn't help and made matters worse. Then he took some water in a bathroom and everything was better. If the frame is less the same, he wouldn't have had any hope or he would have hope but he wouldn't fall and go up, making the story interesting.

Winding hills, limited water, and wrong directions are this cyclist's problems. First he receives very bad instructions from a group of old men who have not been outside their porch in broad daylight, then he walks through the first town and does not fill his water bottles, then he gets lost and runs out of water but finds a fisherman storing where there is water and people who give him a better card.

No water, and no direction affects the rider. Water effect cyclist because he said in the essay "I could fall from heat stroke" (Kurmaskie). Plus, no direction is another great. This is important because without direction it will roll for a long time. In conclusion of water and no direction was the problem of the cyclist in the story

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as he thought he had carried enough water. He didn't realize how hot it was until he took his last sips of water. He started to get dehydrated, he remembered the old men said the next town was eighteen miles away, so he continued when he reached town, there was nothing to drink just an old dilapidated factory. He took the same rocks and sucked them, he went over a bump that had swallowed him. He told himself that the next time he followed what the map said, everything he had passed along the way had been dilapidated and abandoned. Eventually he reached a bait shop and walked into the bathroom and got some water.

Features of the arrangement affected the cyclist grid deal. For example, this was not the case and the hill became dehydrated. He took that rusty, bumpy road, which didn't help his dehydration. That the lines on the frame are fond of the cyclist.

The cyclist crosses many natural environments that affect him. First of all, he rides in arid lands. The cyclist described this sterility by saying “ it fits the traditional definition of a ghost town ”. It was in response to the first "city" he encountered. Then he talks about a big snake that has approached him, which is dangerous, but luckily he gets out of his way. But the worst setting the rider had to face was the lack of water. It is a threat to all living things. But in the end he found water and the story ended well.         

<START>

 

In the essay "Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit", the parameter relates to how the perpetrator is feeling. At the beginning, when the author sees the first abandoned “city”, he doesn't care too much and moves on. “I laughed, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was starting to hit, but I barely noticed it. Author is fine @ CAPS1, and still has enough water. Then he starts to run out of water and he gets more panicked; which in turn makes the day even hotter. “ I knocked out my water bottles quite regularly and traveled through the high deserts of California in June. " @ CAPS1 that the author runs out of water the day looks worse afterwards he goes on and runs into a rattlesnake making him even more panicked" and a ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond jamming the majority of the sidewalk in front of me. I calmed down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. @ CAPS2, when he got to the bait shop and drank in the sink; things didn't seem so bad anymore and there was no longer any talk of water or heat , so the setting was linked to the author's moods.               

<START>

 

The characteristics of the decor affected the cyclist in this little story. In this story, the setting is hot, dry terrain which can best be explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seemed to start to have an effect on him soon after he reached the first city. I know from his statement. “This place might have been a prosperous little place back then - say, before the last war - but that morning it met the traditional definition of a ghost town. I threw in, checked my supplies. in water and moved on. The sun was starting to snap. Summer heat is blossoming during this @ DATE1 and he drinks a lot of water. "So this setting affects him greatly, it causes him to use his water supply and makes it start the dehydration process. I know how the summer heat can affect you during @ DATE1 activities. Sometimes it feels like you're going to die, but this building is always around the corner just for the cyclist.

In Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit, the characteristics of the frame are devastating for the condition of the riders. “@ CAPS1 through the high desert of California” is certainly never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration people often suffer from heatstroke or fainting, sometimes even perishing, it is much worse for this rider because of the strain he exerts while pedaling over " short hills and hilly ”. Worse yet, the trail that a few very old and eccentric men set out on doesn't do much to get rid of a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist encounters easily separates "the traditional definition of a ghost town" and the only other water pump he encounters emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only aggravated by the appearance of the water on the cycle path. This combination of characteristics in the then frame causes a lot of distress to the cyclist and almost pushes him to death.        

<START>

 

The setting affected the rider in several ways in this story, such as the weather, the food and water supply, poor estimation of the elderly and the road. First of all, the weather was very dry and it was two hundred degrees so it made you sweat and find it hard to breathe. The water supply was difficult, not much at all and when he was trying to get water the pumps were not pumping water. The weather and the water supply were two major effects on the rider.   

<START>

 

At the beginning of the story, the author is happy, but towards the end gets angry. “I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face” (@ NUM1). It shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is traveling and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn: "With what I thought was my last burst of energy, I hurtled down the hill" (@ NUM2). After getting lost in a city that seems far from all living things, the author hears people! She is extremely relieved to have found someone to help her. She gets water and is eternally grateful. The setting is horrible for her because you will feel like you can't even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting were in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel safe even without water

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. The reasons were the water and the hills. One of the reasons was water because his water was cooled as long as he filled it completely. My last reason is because of the hills.   

<START>

 

There are features such as the blazing heat from the sun, “ short rolling hills ” and the absence of water. There was also the fact that the runner thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the rider, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water, and constant climbs can take a lot of energy from someone and make driving extremely difficult. Not to mention that there is not much hope left, which eliminates all spirit rather than matter. All the characteristics of the frame together can cause major problems.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. After about @ NUM1 miles, when he needed a water supply, the rider found a rusty pipe from which a tar-like substance was coming out and then a brackish water substance. When you cycle, you need clean water. Then the terrain went from flat to very hilly. Need Water, The Last Thing You Need Is To Be More Challenged. Later in the food there were no cars and buildings in silos. When you are feeling the worst you want someone near you in case you stumble, but no one was there on that road. Lost, seeing the old welch grape juice factory would affect the rider. Seeing this image of a beverage factory right in front of you, but no business, must bring them down like it never gets there. These characteristics of the frame must affect the rider.         

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now, if he was in a callada, he wouldn't be dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most important parameter is the welch grape juice plant. He would have had all the grape juice he wanted, but he was abandoned. Ironically, "as he calls it. And the last one is the hasty bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the scenery affect the cyclist because he was in the middle of nowhere with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no more water in his water bottle, he started to feel very thirsty. I found an example to show he was thirsty. “ The speed limit was @ NUM1. I was doing a @ NUM2 which depletes the water. Sometimes life can seem so cruel ”. Saying he was doing @ NUM2 when he should have been @ NUM1. said he was getting very exhausted and needed water to feel refreshed again. Plus, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction also affected him because he didn't know where the next refudge was. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. “From a man's point of view, he probably thought civilization was a lot more miles away and he probably couldn't do it for that. The executive affected him making him probably start to stress or panic a lot for the most part.            

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example, he feels dehydrated and tired because he is crossing the desert and lacking water. This is what I often feel when jogging for long periods of time. The men in the story "who have not left the confines of their front porch since Carter was in power" also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut which turns out to be horrible. Welch's factory affects the cyclist as it increases his thirst and causes him to think again. The sign for grape juice strikes him as irresistible and prompts him to move forward in search of something to drink. Terrain load also affects the rider as it forces them to work harder and harder to climb hills rather than just riding on level ground.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1 it says : “ I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ”. @ CAPS1 the heat that the cyclist endured, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate more quickly. The heat made him drink more and he ran out of water faster. Then he would try to conserve water by not drinking which would cause him to become more dehydrated because he was losing body fluid in sweat, second, in paragraph @ NUM2 it says : "The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills ", these hills affect the cyclist because he would need more energy to climb the hills. This would cause him to burn out faster than he would on flat ground. If the setting had been different, like not being in a hilly desert, the rider wouldn't have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways.           

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame directly affect the rider. "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." This affects the cyclist because in June it is very hot and crossing a desert makes the situation worse, then he would keep drinking water until he ran out of it. It also uses energy which makes him sweat and drink more water. “A dilapidated shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that could not contain the most lame mule greeted me. It could also be a problem as he cannot renew his water source which means he has to conserve it and cannot use that much energy. These two elements are taken into account in the setting, in a desert without water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in cold weather.       

<START>

 

The rider in "Do not exceed posted speed limit" was greatly affected by the characteristics of the frame. First of all the weather was extremely hot and the hot weather makes you feel exhausted and like there is nothing you can do. Moreover, no one is in sight. She is all alone, which makes her feel small and helpless. I know that when there is no one around, I am afraid. Finally, there is no water around. The author is visibly dying of thirst and with nothing around her, she acts even more thirsty.      

<START>

 

The setting affected the rider by rough roads, with the rider having difficulty pedaling on the roads. The snake, the cyclist was afraid of the snake while crossing the "city". The fact that he was running out of water and the water he found tasted like battery acid. The setting was very harsh for the cyclist.   

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider by making them stepped, scared, thirsty and worried. The setting was a hot California day in June and the rider was riding through the heat and over hills and rough terrain. The cyclist describes the terrain when he says: “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills. " He also said:" Over a long paralyzing hill.

In the test titled "Rough Road Ahead: Don't Exceed the Speed Limit", the setting changes as does test mood @ NUM1 as well as the mood of the rider. For example, towards the start of the trial, on the reserve, the essay states, “ At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, Calif., I enjoyed the serenity of an early evening. summer. " This shows how, towards the beginning of the test, the cyclist is happy just woke up and started reading for a nice bike ride ; However, everything changes when he receives instructions from a group of "elders". From that point on, its journey descends and the test reads : "About forty miles off the pedal, I came to the first 'town', a ghost town," "The sun was starting to heat up", it also shows the setting of a ghost town and a banging sunset affect the mood of the test and the mood of the rider as well as when he rides @ NUM2 miles again in another ghost town with just a few pushups rusty water bottles containing acid flavored water.

The dusty and dry surroundings have a serious effect on the cyclist. It got so long and hot that, "... @ CAPS1 blues tune 'summer time' rocked in ... my deteriorating brain." The author spent so much time riding a bike through the heat, his brain started to stop. It is also because he has very little water left. Another problem is that every building / city except the last building is deserted. So with no chance of being replenished and replenished, it is the perpetrator against nature. Plus, as the author notes, the instructions came from older people who, " ... haven't left their front porch since Carter took office." " The word has changed. The towns have become deserted, the buildings dilapidated, but the roads are kept in good condition. The towns mentioned by the elderly are now ghost towns and are of no help to the author.

As the rider continues to run, changes start to occur in the environment, which ultimately affects the attitude of the rider. At the start of his trip to Yosemite, the cyclist started that morning, "with strong legs and a smile on my face." He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help cut the time it took to get to Yosemite National Park. However, as he rode, the rider realized that the older men's travel advice might be a bit out of date. with hardly more water to hydrate, and being surrounded only by road and desert, the cyclist could not help laughing. " It was a sad, desperate laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself." “At this point, the cyclist was angry with himself for not just using the map he brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had started to lose hope when he suddenly stumbled upon a bait shop. Here he was able to rehydrate and, with his renewed spirit, continued his journey, this time using his card.

The characteristics of the frame of this story, " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", greatly affect the rider. The cyclist was cycling through California in a desert area. It can get very hot there, as the writer describes, "large rings of sweat were circling my shirt." The fact that the area he was cycling through and that he had no more water put him in danger. In addition, since the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated. The area he cycled through was infrequently used. This means that there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the set-up had taken place in a cooler setting with a lot of people, the rider would have found water. Without this type of setting, history would have changed completely.

The setting affects the rider a lot. "I maneuvered down the hill." This statement shows him walking down the hill.

The setting for this story was warm and filled with hills. These factors greatly affected the cyclist. The hot weather was bad for the rider as he had a limited water supply. The text reads: "The sun was beginning to beat" (@ NUM1). Showing that the temperature was rising. The text reads: " The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills " (@ NUM2). The author's battery was leaking acid, so it was more difficult to walk through the hills. Seems like everything went wrong for this man, but he did it anyway.

In the starting story “ Do not exceed the speed limit ”, the time of year and the location were the main things that affected the rider. This story takes place in the deserts of California in June. The fact that the story takes place in June (and especially in a Californian desert) is indeed what caused the dehydration of the cyclist. All over this country, June is summer, and summer means it's hotter and more humid than usual. This heat causes dehydration and the 'growing awareness that I (the author)

The settings of the story have affected the rider throughout history with winding roads and hills that can already be rough, tiring and difficult with the rider not having much to see or the roads were ten times more difficult to manage.

Don't let anything stop you with your goals. Go to Yosemite National Park. Assume a status that would go home offside. Forty miles in trys get to a town. Come to a water station and get nothing because the old men say "the water tastes of buttery acid." Heading towards hills and azyl towns, @ CAPS1 can be run in without drinking anything.

The characteristics of the rider's frame actually affect it in several ways. The passage setting includes such things as no one to see, no buildings, dirty and bumpy terrain, hot weather, and lots of vegetation. All of these characteristics affect the rider in a negative way. For example, dry weather affects the human body with dehydration from which the cyclist is affected.

The setting of the story greatly affects the cyclist. We are in June in the Californian desert. The sun is heating up on him. Another problem he faces is that there is very rough terrain.

Each person has a very good ability that stands out. Someone can be good looking, smart, or confident. Someone @ MONTH1 never gives up and does whatever they want to do. The cyclist in the story is a man with a strong will. He wants to be alive. He saw too much difficulty in his path to get the place he wanted to be. He listened to old people and he got lost. The sun was starting to crack. He was out of water but continued to ride to reach his goal. He was losing his strength. The time was NUM1 @ @ CAPS1.L'eau had the taste of acid battery. He believed in life. He grew stronger by believing in himself even though he was losing strength. Every place he passed was a new experience for life. They were like a game he succeeded. He never gives up. He did everything to not lose his mind. He didn't want to lose the battle in his mind.

The characteristics of the frame made the rider more tired and thirsty. The rolling hills where he had to cycle up and down and the desert with no water in sight, just dry land. Everything about the setting increased the conflict in its story. The old Welch's grape juice factory, it's like the drinks were there but are now gone. If it had been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers it would have felt completely different. No one in sight lacked security and water, nor buildings. The weeds left you no hope of going anywhere and the snakes and vultures would only eat you after you died. Everything in the story was the opposite of what he wanted until he reached his last hope, the bait shop.

In the story “ Rough Road Ahead ; Do not exceed the posted speed limit ”, the context of the story strongly affected the cyclist. The story tells us “ ... I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. " The extreme heat of the summer has definitely put the cyclist strain forcing him to drink plenty of water. Unfortunately, the " towns " were very far from each other and many did not have good water, which made the problem of dehydration . "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." @ CAPS1 this would have happened if he had done a marathon bike ride with people giving him water on demand, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map.

The characteristics of the frame have been a major effect of this cyclist in history. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but the reflection is very similar and curvy. The rider also encounters bumps, unpaved roads that make commuting difficult. Then you add the fact that there aren't really any cities and it's scorching hot with little water. The setting for this passage played a key role in the story.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider in that they must behave, act or speak according to the settings. This means that wherever they exist and however they look, they have to adapt to themselves. They also need to adapt to the mood depending on where they are. The cyclist feels comfortable according to the story and does not need any change of setting or location. To conclude, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider in that they have to make improvements and changes depending on where they are.

At first the cyclist was ready to go and happy. By the time he got halfway he was "losing hope." It was very hot and he was simple alone. In the end, he was relieved because not only did he find water, but he also found an easier way to get to Yosemite. The first old group of men didn't help, but the second did.

In the story “ Do not exceed the posted speed limit ”, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider, they say it because the rider lets us know what is going on around him and he feels it. rusty pumps and a coral that couldn't contain the most crappy mule did me a lot of good. The author goes on to say that this troubled him. In fact, it scared the author that he might be all alone in the desert with a ghost town. Unexpectedly, the roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55mph as it had almost no water it was traveling at 12mph. This tells me he is flustered and confused about the surrounding lanes as the whole desert feels light it has become the author slowly loses hope on I think this is the same week people start to lose hope and their better judgment as soon as there are problems, or it looks like it's among them, and life seems a lot more difficult.

In this story, it looks like everything is dry. The rider would be really thirsty. He is the one that would make any man strong, because if you have an ascendant no one would be there to help you. It goes up and down steep hills so it should be careful.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example, if you were riding a bike in a very cold climate, you wouldn't sweat so much and need to drink so much water, but in the story, the cyclist is in a very hot climate and lacks plenty of water. water, "The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sps, large drops of sweat circled my shirt and the growing awareness that I might fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day…" This quote explains that the frame of cycling plays a huge role in the rider. Besides, the terrain can affect the rider. If one were to ride on level ground, it would put a lot of wear and tear on the riders body, hence the terrain flat would be easier.These are all reasons that the settings affect the rider in several ways.

The setting plays an important role in the mood of the authors. When the author finds the ghost town run down, he is still lively and amused. He thinks it's a little funny that the "city" of old people has now been abandoned. “… (The city) fits the traditional definition of a ghost town. I laughed… ”This shows that the author is still in a good mood because he can still laugh. When "a tar- like substance seeped out of the water pump at the next stop, the perpetrator became a little unstable because the perpetrator was running out of water. But he was still optimistic. Once the vast rolling hills appeared, the author let out a "sad and desperate laugh". The author was depressed, dehydrated and had practically given up, but he continued and finally managed to drink the water.               

<START>

 

In the passage “ Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed the speed limit ”, the setting must definitely affect the rider. When the cyclist comes to the first abandoned "town" he looks for water but only finds the one that tastes like battery acid "when I tried a drop or two it tasted like battery acid ”. The fact that his dehydration seems much worse due to the fact that he has water, it's just undrinkable. The rough road ahead gives us a sense of determination because when the cyclist is on his last legs he has to work even harder to get water, a flat road has been replaced by short hills ”, this quote shows that despite his condition, the cyclist is the most persevering. Also quote " Crazy grasses crossed my path and a ridiculously tall snake - " Crazy grasses and snakes make you feel desolate and lonely, which is what the rider is at this point. The setting of this story is directly correlated with how the cyclist feels.

The hot June day cycling in the desert. The cyclist took off in the sun towards Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they hadn't crossed this path in years. When the cyclist started his day ready to go. He thought he could stop and take water regularly, but when he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself away and stopped thinking about the water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he could keep his mind above water.

When he was between the “ghost town” and the bait shop, he said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider due to the heat, the size of the hill and the lack of cold water. For example, it's so hot that the cyclist doesn't think he's going to get there. Plus all he could do was run out of water @ NUM1. In addition, the hills got so big that he hit the first torque until the sign came up indicating that the road is difficult: do not exceed the posted speed limit. Lastly he had rough terrain to ride on and no water he was in a dehydrated state and he could only run out of water @ NUM1 when the speed limit was @ NUM3.

The humid climate and hot weather will want to force you to stay if you don't have water in your possession. As towards the end of the test, the person sucked stones to try to better hold the water who had never heard of it. This time is the cause of the character ??? dehydration which is a symptom of lack of water in the body.

The features of the setting affect the rider because in paragraph @ NUM1 it says that the temperature gets high, and when he drinks the water it will test like battery acid. It would affect him because it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot, how could he get through the day without passing out also in paragraph @ NUM2 it says the roads turned into hills when you go up and down the hills you get tired of pumping your legs up so you would feel hot and tired and not want to ride a bike. This is how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider.

The characteristics of the frame or the environment in which the cyclist finds himself greatly affect him. First of all, after leaving the campsite with the directions of the older gentlemen, he enters a very isolated area. In the @ NUM1 paragraph he wrote : “ This place may have been a small, prosperous place at one point, but at @ TIME1 it met the traditional definition of a ghost town. This state of loneliness then affected the cyclist due to his increasing dehydration. was becoming dangerous; if he collapsed he would most likely die. This prompted the cyclist to keep going in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In the paragraph, he hints that it is hot by telling the reader that he is traveling to the California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another hurdle to overcome in their struggle to get to the next town to collect water. Finally, in paragraph @ NUM2, he mentions that the terrain turns into gently rolling hills. It shows that physical and metaphorical obstacles must overcome the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental motivation and determination to keep going.

The setting affects the rider in many ways, namely if you don't know where you are going you could get injured. This is also the case if the condition of the road is very bad. This is how the setting affected the rider.

In this essay, the characteristics of the setting affect the cyclist on their journey to Yosemite, making the situation worse. For example, the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. What makes it bad from the heat makes it harder on the rider. Also being in the deserts, there was no water supply, so after the cyclist ran out of water, it got worse because he got hot, and made him become more weak and not pedaling as fast. In addition, the author says that the tar goes from flat roads to small hills, which also made things more difficult because the small hills made more work, and since it was so hot and he had no no water, it could not work. as well as if he was hydrated.

The characteristics of the setting in this story greatly affect the cyclist. Throughout this story, this poor man must get lost and find himself in the middle of nowhere. By going out, her cycle was affected. She was just trying to go somewhere and get things done, but of course she didn't. She continued to descend. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it badly.     

<START>

 

In this story, the cyclist had to ride through the desert, during the month of June and with little water. I would say this has a big effect on the rider as he gets dehydrated a lot and is at risk of heat stroke. In addition, he had to carefully walk past a huge snake that could have injured him. Personally, I don't know what he was rolling threw the dessert out on his own, and that's his problem.

In @ CAPS1 "Do not exceed posted speed limit", there are many ways that affect the rider. Three of those things are heat, lack of water, mud, it's rubbish in the city. The heat affects him as he becomes extremely hot and tired. For example, the text says : " I could die of heat stroke a beautiful day in June. " This shows that it was extremely hot. The cyclist was running out of water and was very thirsty. For example, it says in the text : "I calmed down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." This shows that he was very thirsty for lack of water. The last way the frame affects the rider is when he walks into a city and empties it. The text reads: "That morning it met the traditional definition of a ghost town". This show shows that he expected him to be there so he could rest, but it wasn't like these were things that all showed how the frame affected the rider.               

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider in several ways. The first and foremost way was that he was riding across the dessert. This made him sweat a lot and become very dehydrated. The second way was that there were rough roads and hilly brats, which made him more tired faster. In conclusion, the setting didn't help him at all.    

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. The cyclist should have looked at his map instead of following the old man's advice as all the information was on the map. He almost died because he listened to old people and didn't look at his map. If the cyclist was in a car he would have better luck because he would go faster than the @ NUM1 bike.     

<START>

 

Lots of things on the cycle route affected him. It was midsummer in California. The heat is incredible and ridiculously hot. "... I could have heatstroke ..." he was so overheated and pissed off that he could die at any time. He could also have been killed by a giant snake. “… Looks like a diamond back - blocked most of the sidewalk…” It could have easily killed him, if he hadn't been careful. But with his determination and annoyance, he pulled and went to a spring of cool water. If he had given up, his life would be over.       

<START>

 

When the cyclist went to inquire about the route, the old men told him all the right way to go. But the old man has not seen the earth for a very long time. It does not take long for man to change the earth. So when the cyclist is back on the roads and everything stops? the cyclist did not know what to do.     

<START>

 

There are many reasons why the characteristics of the frame affect the rider. There are ways mentally and physically. Mentally, cyclists can lose their resolve and pride if they cannot tackle the bicycle trip. The paths are physically hot and rough and the cyclist would have a lack of water and food supplies. This is how the rider would be affected by the characteristics of the frame, both mentally and physically.    

<START>

 

The Rough Road Ahead cyclist was riding his bike in mid-June and through California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bicycle. This is because in June it is usually hot, and I know in @ CAPS1 it is usually always hot, the rider is on a bike, that means he has to pedal wherever he goes. It's not going to use all of his energy but also make him hot, and when you're that hot you need to stay hydrated. But you are lost, so if you use all your water before you find safety you will be in big trouble. Also in California there are hills and mountains and stopping and going up a mountain is not an easy trick.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One of the reasons the characteristics affected it was that when it ran out of water, all the buildings looked like a ghost town. He said there was no one in sight. In the story, it is written "the abandoned building years earlier". If I were him, I would have turned around and turned around to try not to die in the middle of an abandoned area.    

<START>

 

The frame is the main factor affecting the rider. The rider's main problem is that he or she lacks water and is dehydrated, " trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state ". The author wouldn't have been so dehydrated if it hadn't been so hot. Moreover, all the problems he faces are related like the snake and the rough road. If this had taken place in a milder area, there would have been no conflict.      

<START>

 

In the story the rider is affected by the setting because in paragraph @ NUM1 it says he saw the old water pump and how he was trying to get the water out. At the end of the story, he gets angry when he sees the old welches juice factory because he realizes that the old men didn't know what they were talking about. Also at the end it is realized when he finds Gary and @ ORGANIZATION1 because there is water there.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider in Joe Kurmaskie's " Rough Road Ahead " in a very profound way. While driving, he sees "no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind" around him. When he realizes his loneliness while in a state of near dehydration, he despairs. Due to the isolation of the frame, having seen only "a dilapidated hangar for several kilometers, the cyclist almost loses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of the "cool pines and rushing rivers of @ CAPS1". This is how the cyclist is affected by his surroundings, and how despair turns into hope.       

<START>

 

The setting affects the rider as it is very hot outside and he starts to lose energy. The setting affects how fast it rolls when stopping or when drinking or eating. it all depends on the type of weather it is driving in. as in the story, it was so hot when he saw a building that he wiped the sweat from his face to make sure it wasn't a mirage.  

<START>

 

In the test " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " The characteristics of the setting had a big impact on the hard-working rider. The weather and surrounding objects really determined the mood and ability of the riders. An example would be the statement " the cool pines, the rushing rivers upstream had my name written all over it." The refreshing nature and the fresh air made the rider feel confident, energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, "A dilapidated, several rusty pumps and a corral that could not contain the most crappy mule greets me." There, the cyclist feels confused and a little curious to know what to expect this water was not the best and he was worried. The last example was “ the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills… weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. " There, the rider tries to stay focused through distractions. He is deserted and he also feels dehydrated. At the end of his route he encounters many other aspects of the setting that create a different feeling or capacity. Therefore, the nature of where his bike went and the things he saw affected his choices and abilities.

There are many characteristics in the frame that affect the rider, one of which is that he is in the middle of California, cycling in the sun with a limited amount of water. This affects the rider as he almost collapses due to heat stroke and lack of water. This is how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider.  

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting in this trial affected the rider in several ways. "A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that could not contain the most crappy mule greeted me." (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The cyclist expected a small town with people and a good supply of water. However, he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn't even provide water. This made the cyclist depressed because he lacked water and could easily become dehydrated without it. “ The speed limit was @ NUM2. I was doing a @ NUM3 which depletes the water. sometimes life can seem so cruel. (Kurmaskie @ NUM4). The cyclist may be passed by cars on the freeway going @ NUM2 when he is only going @ NUM3. It probably makes him feel like he's not going anywhere. It would be one more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.              

<START>

 

The cyclist had very little water. It was very hot. He had a long way to go. The road was very bumpy so he couldn't go too fast or his tires could burst. There were some known cars on the site, so if it broke down it would have taken even longer.

The setting affects the rider in several ways. And taking the advice of the elders wasn't too smart of him. In this essay, he was heading to Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he's a cyclist he knows well. But a couple of men came around who told him a shortcut. He trusted them, which he shouldn't have had and he was on his way. The setting was harsh. He was crossing a Californian desert; which probably wasn't, and he was looking at the water. The only thing he found tasted like lively drums and so it wasn't good for him. It was flat land, rather than hills. The next city would have been within the miles @ NUM1. This cyclist rode himself. As we walked along these lands, there was more in sight, and no buildings or cars, it was along a dead road. These old men had him through his neck and were, once he got to the next town he knew with these conditions             

<START>

 

On the cyclist's way to Yosemite National Park, a group of old men give him directions, but their directions aren't that good. The location of the dessert affected him as there was nowhere to stop and eat or fill his water bottle. no kind ”. There were rusty water pumps, with hot water, but nothing to cool it down. His environment drove him to a state of dehydration.   

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting, including the immense void, hills, heat and lack of water, all create obstacles for the rider in " Do not exceed posted speed limit ". @ CAPS1 in the vast void of the area he was traveling in, he couldn't stop somewhere to ask for help or to rest. Also, there were no other travelers so he couldn't ask them for help. Another obstacle on his journey are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal uphill, so it ends up getting tired easily and taking longer than expected. There is also an extreme heat which makes him sweat and even become even more thirsty. So it ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, "The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips." He is now thirsty and if he cannot find water he is dehydrating @ MONTH1. He is looking for a place to rest where there is @ MONTH1 water but he is not able to. All these obstacles make the cyclist devastated and lose hope but he continues his journey and ends up finding a place to rest. All these obstacles are linked to each other.

The characteristics of the frame affect a rider in several ways. If you have a bumpy ride, the rider will have more trouble. also, if it's really hilly then it's harder and will take longer too. “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills. It will take longer for him to reach his destination. animals in the frame can also be effective. and a ridiculously large snake - it really looked like a diamond back - blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me. " Animals can get in the way like this snake did for the rider. If a squirrel or some other animal was crossing the merry-go-round right in front of you, it might scare you and you might run into each other. Sometimes trees make things cooler because that you don't need to hit yourself directly on the back. If there is a stream of fresh water, you can stop and get rid of all the sweat and have a drink. The frame in which the cyclist rides can help or injure the rider.

There were a few features in the frame that affected the rider. A very important characteristic is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is evidenced by the statement "I was traveling through the high deserts of California." not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is shown that he was there in June reading the " I was traveling in June " statement. @ CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a greater risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump he said " blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees ". From here we can state that not only was hot, the water was dirty. The water also " tasted like battery acid ." It was bad for the cyclist who ran out of water because he "had hit (his) water bottles quite regularly". The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement: “The water bottle only contained a few mouthwatering sips. The cyclist was in a bad situation. They had ganged up against him during his trip. These characteristics are desert, high temperatures, and blackish water that tasted like battery acid. Lack of water made it harder to fight these features with water, it would fight desert, high temperatures, and wouldn't need to pump bad water. Again, the frame characteristics that affected the rider are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water he couldn't drink.

In the story "Rough Road Ahead", the cyclist was excited and determined to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to think of beautiful waters with "His name written on it". The rough terrain and inclement weather took its affection on the unconscious cyclist. The sun beating on the cyclist's back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him drink his water frequently in small sips to drink. The cyclist learned from the old man that a town was only NUM1 miles away. The city was the traditional definition of a ghost town. “It probably gave the cyclist no hope of surviving and finding someone to help him reach his destination. The state of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, meant that the cyclist did not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandoned places he had seen. The rider was badly affected by the settings but eventually received a little help from a traditional map.        

<START>

 

In Joe Kurmaskie's " Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit " test, the frame characteristics affected the rider as it was more difficult for him to survive and get through his trip. In the essay it is written: " I came to the first ' Town ' ... this place may have been a prosperous little place at one time ... but that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @ NUM1). In the test, the cyclist takes the directions of a few old men to go to Yosemite National Park. The rider has a limited amount of water, and it was a very wet day to travel. Due to the humidity the rider almost ran out of water when he had to climb "short rolling hills" (@ NUM2) in hot weather. If the city had been prosperous, he could have bought more water to facilitate his journey. Also, if the road in the story had been flat, the rider would not have been as tired as him and would have needed more water. It would have been less painful for the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges of the cyclist reminded me of the main character of the movie @ PERSON2. In this film, the main character has to make his way through the extreme desert conditions, just like the cyclist had to do to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the rider's ride in a negative way.

In the story " Rough Road Ahead " by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the scenery. The cyclist said he had to ride over terrain that was initially smooth but then turned into rolling hills. He also must have found his way around a large snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he ran out of water while cycling in a desert area, but because he was determined to reach the water, he managed to cross.

In the "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" selection, there is a lot of detail about the area around the rider. In the text it is clear that the route taken by the cyclist is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as seeping and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people had not been there for a while. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I can understand how thirsty he is. In addition, he travels for miles over rough terrain and “crippling hills,” according to the text, so he must be extremely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset to have wrong directions due to the problems he has when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are happy that he has reached a place that does was not empty and deserted.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as it was passing through a hot place at a hot time of the year and did not have a lot of water. In the text, it is written "I was browsing the high desserts of California in June". Deserts are always hot and June is a very hot month. The cyclist got thirsty faster from the heat and could not drink much because he had little water.   

<START>

 

The setting affected the rider because since it was the California desert, and it was June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to be very thirsty and to drink all his water. After almost all of his water was gone, he started to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there is no one to help him if he becomes dehydrated and passes out, so he has to persevere and really overcome the situation. if he wants to survive. But he ends up finding a bait shop and having a drink there so it's okay.

The towns, the terrain, the Welch's grape juice factory are all part of the setting that affects the rider. “This place might have been a prosperous little place at one point, say, before the last world war,” describes the cyclist, “but that morning it met the traditional definition of a ghost town.” The city intensifies the feeling of doubt among cyclists, in that it increases. At this point, he really regrets taking the old man's advice in taking the ' shortcut '. “Less than three kilometers from the next section of the route, I noticed that the terrain was changing,” reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very dubious, and the terrain is getting worse, it reflects the city in which the cyclist had stopped a little earlier to further increase his feeling of doubt. The rider exclaims, “At first glance, it was a Welch's grape juice factory.” The rider is very excited when he sees this and feels a great sense of hope. Thus, throughout the story, the environment in which the cyclist finds himself affects his mood by giving him doubt, but also by giving him hope.

The cyclist roamed the California deserts during the hot summer months. The heat and the uninhabited canal were the cyclist's biggest struggle. For example, he thought there would be a lot of water stops before his trip, but he was wrong. In addition, it runs out of water very quickly due to heat dehydration. The cyclist got angry with himself for trusting someone else to show him a shortcut. The frame affected the rider's mood in a negative way.

There were many characteristics in the course of this bike race that affected the rider. He said: “ the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills ” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The rider was pedaling well until those big hills kicked in and his energy dwindled as he went. He also said: “At one point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake” (Kurmaskie @ NUM2). This debris and this snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down. There were a lot of features in the frame that made the rider affected to slow it down and lose energy.

A lot can affect a rider and the way he rides, in this essay a lot has affected him like the setting of the story. One of the problems with the frame was that there were no shops or even people, another most important thing was the lack of water around it, so many things can affect a rider while they are roll, including suriondings.

The second photo better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay " A sea concern", because the story is about a boy surfing for work and in the second photo a boy surfing.

The condition of the cyclist greatly affects the way he rides. An example of this is, "I was traveling through the high desert of California in June." @ CAPS1 by this fact, the cyclist had entered a "state of dehydration" due to the lack of water. When you travel to hot areas without a lot of water, your body becomes dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists differently.

Many frame characteristics affected the rider in “ Rough Road Ahead ”. First, the scorching desert heat in June was a major issue that brought him to the brink of dehydration. In the text it says: "I could have heatstroke on a beautiful day in June (@ CAPS1)." This shows the effect of heat exposure on the @ NUM1 rider. In addition, the land has posed a threat to its well-being throughout history. In the text it says “ I worked hard (@ CAPS2) ”. This shows the increase in the force of deformation of the terrain caused to the cyclist during his adventure.

In Joe Kurmaskie's story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. Being hot affected him because it made him thirstier even more.

The characteristics that affect the cyclist are that they are riding a bicycle in the desert and have no water.

In history, the setting has a great influence on the cyclist. After following the advice of old people, he found himself in the desert with no cars, buildings or people. He was running out of water and had no way to get it anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he was really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and the lack of water. It was all caused by the setting he was in.

The setting of the place was "ghost town" as the author put it. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the rider would get dehydrated. There was no one around, so he couldn't ask for help.

The frame affected the rider in different ways. At first it helped him. “The sun was starting to hit, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and the rushing rivers ”This means that the pines and the rivers helped him forget the sun. Later the bet was against him. There was no place to draw water and he became dehydrated, the terrain became more and more rugged. There was no one around to help him, but there was a snake. All of these characteristics worked against him until he finally came to a bait shop. This bait shop gave him water and a good map.

The characteristics of the decor have greatly affected the author's story. It affected him making the journey more difficult for the reader. This was made possible by recounting how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says "on a long crippling hill". It makes the reader think that the journey is very difficult because it has to climb so many hills. But if the road was not so hilly, the journey would seem less difficult. It would also act as if the old people were giving good directions. But the main thing.

As soon as the cyclist inquired about the way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They it have given a sense of confidence and physically cooled his body. As he walked down the road he encountered various small towns - none of which looked promising - which made him feel hopeless, depending on his lack of water. Even further . the trip he found one last city and the arrundown welche @ CAPS1 factory . This increased his thirst and made him feel resentful towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he quickly found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner.

This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run out of water. It's similar to when I was hiking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal backpacking trip had become a game of survival. Thus, the issue of water was clearly the main point of conflict that the author presented in the framework. He also writes that “ Not two miles in this next section of the trip, I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. This aspect of the frame also affects the rider as it makes his progress much more difficult than if it were a downhill. In short, the story setting presents the main points of conflict to the author and was therefore essential to the essay.

In the test "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the unbearable setting affects the rider with its difficult conditions. At first, in the cyclist's own words, " things started off pretty well ". @ CAPS1, this is changing soon. The road is long and strewn with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to drink. He doesn't give up, @ CAPS1, in the text it says, "I got back on the bike, but didn't bother to pick up a few peldders and put them in my mouth." He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the height the frame brings him.       

<START>

 

The rider is affected by the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" because the road is a place and whether it is rough or unknown it is a direct effect on the traveler, which is the rider. If it is a hill then the cyclist would have In the text it says "on a long crippling hill", the disabling hill part emphasizes that the frame is a hill.

The characteristics of the setting affect the cyclist as there are water, hills and deserts. When cyclists saw water wanting to jump in, all he thought of was water they lacked like battery acid. Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert made him want water even more. These are some of the characteristics of the settings that affected the rider.   

<START>

 

There were a lot of characteristics in the frame that affected the rider. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said he could have died of heat stroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. Bumps, hills, and wildlife affected the rider's course. What affected him the most was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck stones to distract himself from thirst. As you can see, these issues in the story affected the speaker's trip to Yosemite National Park.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. He rides in the desert where there is little rain. This means that he cannot fetch water to drink if it is lacking. In addition, the desserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process, so it will need more water to survive. If it lacks water, it will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these characteristics of the decor affect him. Since he cannot find water, he must conserve what he has. Plus, the heat kills him. It doesn't help that an abandoned building is the only one it finds. During all the time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, without water, the cyclist thinks of his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the stones in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop that saves his life. He thought about his survival and immediately found a store where he could drink.

The frame affected the rider a lot throughout his race. "The water bottles contained only a few mouthwatering sips and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke (pG @ NUM1 kurmaskie)." This quote says that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of its "shortcut" it is running out of water. It is then that he realizes that he could die of heat stroke because he listened to a bunch of old men.   

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. He is in the desert and lacking water. Without water he got tired very easily. In addition he had to pedal a bicycle. So he was thirsty and tired of being in the wilderness. This is how the setting affected the rider.    

<START>

 

The setting affects the rider. The cyclist must be concerned with the condition of the road. If the road conditions are bad, the cyclist should reduce his speed. The cyclist should also be concerned about whether it is day or night. If it is dark, they have to be careful because cars cannot see them. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous for cyclists if they are not prepared with things such as water.      

<START>

 

The setting affects the rider because the rider thinks they have a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite, but instead it's a long, hilly (rough) and hot trip . He only prepared for a quick trip, bringing just enough water for the trip, and was unprepared for the reality of his trip. First off it rolls in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the "high deserts of colifornia in June" I know when I'm going to camp here at @ LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions "a few bottles of water" which will not help him in this heat. Second, the cyclist believed the old men had given him a safe path to follow, but instead he came across a "ridiculously big snake". He really looked like a diamond back ”It's a poisonous snake and the cyclist could hardly“ let go ”due to his lack of water. Finally, the cyclist expected the old men to give it an easy route over flat terrain when in fact it has been "replaced by short, rolling hills" which means more needs to be done. efforts (using more water) to climb the hills. The frame definitely affects the cyclist because it is more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how to learn a lesson in life?

The rider is very affected by the characteristics of the frame. For example, the dry and hot place makes him thirsty. Second, ghost towns make it difficult to get supplies. So the bad road slowed him down. Even bad roads would probably hurt him and his bike the roads too would make him work harder.    

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in many negative ways. For example, in the text it says how “ I calmed myself down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state ”. This meant that he was having a hard time being in a place he was unfamiliar with and that he was dehydrated. In conclusion, the adjustment affected the rider.

First, the bike meets flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate; when he gets to his first town he keeps trying to get to Yosemite then after he breaks down so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he continued and he encountered a fork in the road. After the fork he continued and then faced another problem. This problem was that a senior told him to go NUM1 miles into town and he didn't trust the guy. Then the rider listened and continued down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very careful with short high and low hills. These hills greatly reduced his stamina. Then he had to face a stony and bumpy starting road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so that it would not attack it. Eventually the biker faced his last long hill and eventually found a bait and tackle store with plenty of water.

In "Do not exceed posted speed limit", the rider is affected by the characteristics of the setting making them feel worse than they do. The cyclist is lost, has found only dirty water and is moving over rough terrain. The characteristics of the setting are "cool pines and rushing rivers", however, the cyclist comes to find that the "rushing river" is not so refreshing. It also encounters a change of terrain, from a flat road to short rolling hills. There is a "Do not exceed posted speed limit" sign, as well as the name of the crossing with a 55 mph limit, while the rider is only riding 12 mph. Ironically, he finds a photo of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which puts his head down in misery due to his intense thirst. Finally, he arrives at a fishing camp, where he meets the owner who, ironically, tells him he better use his card.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because he will be on the road for a long time. The characteristics of the absence of buildings, people and cars cause the rider to feel helpless when he does not have enough water. The ghost town doesn't help him because the old man told him about it and he thought he might have more water. The grape juice factory hit him because he thought he was going to have a drink but he was abandoned. This is how characteristics affect the rider.    

<START>

 

The characteristics of the scenery would affect me if I was the cyclist because, I would think I was going to die like him because there is nothing to look at, no breeze, no wind, he saw a snake, he had no water. He went through three towns that had nothing. The sun was setting over him, it was hot, he had no hope. Who knows, maybe if he had just followed what the card had said he would have been fine.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat of the "high deserts of California in June". The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation. Not only do the characteristics of the frame affect the rider physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds, rattlesnakes and ghost towns. All this causes the cyclist to begin to lose hope. In conclusion, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider physically and mentally.      

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame have had a huge impact on the rider. First of all, the setting in the middle of the story was empty and there was no place to draw water. It filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he thought he was going to die. The setting also made the rider thirsty due to the extreme heat. Finally, the cyclist was filled with regrets because they regretted having listened to the old men because the cyclist was not going where he wanted to go.

The author thinks that the scenery means that it does not come close to its destination. However, he discovered that there were still people around. He panicked and thought he was going to die. The places were empty and he didn't think he was getting them anywhere. He was a little afraid that he might die because everything around him was in a sense dead.

The setting really affected the rider. Since he was in the desert on his bike, he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun setting over him. You know it was hot where it was written "large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt".   

<START>

 

The characteristics of the tuning affect the rider because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. In the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. Also because he was in the wilderness, he had no sense of direction. In addition, the cities are all dilapidated and without anything, so the cyclist could not drink water to rehydrate. It wasn't until he got near a small bait shop that he finally got some water.     

<START>

 

The cyclist really liked the setting. The sun and the heat dehydrated him. He had also practically run out of water. In the story he says “ The bottles only contained a few drops, it shows that he had drunk almost all of his water.   

<START>

 

The surroundings were calm and peaceful as he started to cycle. He was smiling and his legs were strong. When he hit town @ NUM1 and saw a dilapidated shed, rusty pumps and a corral, he started to be confused because he was running out of water. As the flat tracks replaced with short, rolling hills, he became even more confused. When he saw a building he became happy, but when he found out that it was in ruins he was sad and thirsty and tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map, he got a little happier because he was going to Yosemite. As the frame got worse, his mood deteriorated because he had less and less water and felt very hopeless. But when he saw the man, he became happy because the map was going to help him.        

<START>

 

The framework of this story is very rigorous. At the start of the story, the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so he wouldn't get dehydrated. When he was driving he started to feel the sun rising higher in the sky, even though he could barely feel it. This is because of the pine trees that caused the road and the cool feeling of the river. The cyclist arrived at the second city on his trip and he had been drinking his water all day and was about to get out. He had found a water pump. He knelt down and paled with his hot night all that came, but it was blackish water. He was just scared of the water and said it tasted like battery acid. He started to drive again. Less than three kilometers from the road, the terrain has changed. Not only were it hills, but it was also warmer. He was very dehydrated because he had run out of water, except for a few “mouthwatering sips”. Dry sweat surrounded his shirt and he was afraid of freezing the heatstroke. Where he was was in the middle of nowhere, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Above the hills, he saw that a building was not visible. He wiped the sweat from his eyes, so make sure it wasn't a malinge. He is dehydrated and tired that he could see a "Young boy pouring a glass of refreshing juice into his mouth". It is only the problems that we give up. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and put stones in his mouth. It was to help him forget his thirst.

In Joe Kurmaskie's “Don't Exceed Posted Speed Limit” essay, the frame characteristics affect the rider in several ways. First, the sun makes the rider hot and dehydrated. He states "The sun was starting to hit", @ CAPS1, the sun was a big factor in the effect on the rider. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills is a lot of work, you have to use a lot of energy. Cyclist says "@ CAPS2 have been replaced by short rolling hills." @ CAPS3, there were snakes on the road making the cyclist shy looking for snakes not to get bitten. Again, the cyclist declares " Dimond blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me ". @ CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then dashed his hopes. The factory even made him thirstier. @ CAPS1, there were many effects on the rider due to the tuning.

The characteristics of the decor wreak havoc on the hapless cyclist. For example. " I was traveling through the California desert high in June. California deserts, especially in June, are hot and dry and brought the rider to use a large part of its water supply, very quickly. In as he " worked " on it, the terrain characteristics became even more trying " on a long crippling hill ... " At this point, the rider barely had enough energy to climb a hill because of of all the wear and tear that his body had undergone by the characteristics of his environment.        

<START>

 

The settings of this story have an encouraging impact on this story because it looks alike. The terrain in the story appears rugged when he saw a sign that read " Rugged road ahead of you, do not exceed posted speed limit." " It is already up and down hills with rocks and no water. Such a setting and a truly sporty race can be devastating.     

<START>

 

Rider functionality and settings are not that good. There are insiders who are problematic. One is bad weather. There is a temperature that makes it pretty close to @ NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it's really not cool. He takes two small sips and it's like batarey acid. If he drank a lot of this water, it would probably kill him or make him very sick. He needs something because there was another town NUM2 miles away, so he has to find something to hold it together. As he walks down the road he sees a sign : Rough Road Ahead : Even if he's going 20 km / h, he could still hit a hole and fly over his handlebars. If he goes over his handlebars, he could hit the snake he saw and then get eaten by the birds because he would have no energy to get up. There is an interesting meaning in the story.

Heat, water supply, energy are all characteristics of the environment that can affect a cyclist. First of all, it's the heat. When it is too hot, it makes driving more difficult and inconvenient. Second, is your water supply. If you are driving and you start to run out of water, you are in trouble. The author describes: "The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips." If you are not sufficiently prepared for your bike trip, it will be extremely inconvenient to run out of supplies. Finally, it is energy. If you run out of energy while riding a bike, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. "With what I believe, it was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill," describes the author. When you run out of energy, your commute is over. all of these aspects are important to take into account before deciding to go on a cycling trip.

The characteristics of the setting affect the setting affect the rider by. Dehydrate it from the heat and lack of water and see mirages. And he loses his strength crossing the many hills. And there is a very big snake that he has to ride that could have bitten him.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because when you have hills to climb and little water you will become dehydrated. Moreover, the heat of the desert is so hot that it can also dehydrate you. If you don't calm down and drink too much water, you may be able to reach your goal. Your rest is important because if you don't have energy you won't get far.

The adjustment can affect a rider in several ways. One adjustment affects the rider when it is hot, it is more difficult to cover long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says "... and the growing awareness that I might fall from heat stroke ..." @ CAPS1 Part of the frame that affects the rider is the terrain on which they pedal. For example, it is much easier to cycle on flat, smooth ground than on rolling hills with rocky and rugged ground. This is illustrated by the quote " ... go down distances that I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could go that far, I would be fine." " The adjustment can have much effect on a cyclist, as it is smooth or rocky, hot or cold.

In "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit" Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics of the framework greatly affect the rider. Each characteristic that prompts the cyclist to take action. For example, on reaching the "dilapidated shed", the cyclist finds the water unusable; which has the effect of saving water and trying to head to the next town. This action takes him deeper into the high deserts of California in June. In addition, when the terrain changes from a flat road to short rolling hills, the rider must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings on this desert and dry terrain leads the cyclist to try every "hut or building he encounters for water." In this story, the characteristics of the scenery dictate the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive a lot in the desert.

The cyclist in the test " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " talks about a great adventure that has gone wrong. He has everything he needs, but kinda how things go wrong. It lacks water and the surroundings are horrible. He's en route from a campground at @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION1 to the Yosemite River. He gets bad instructions from some old guys at the campground. On his way, he encountered two abandoned towns and was running out of water, then came to a sign that read : “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit. " He was pedaling on hills and dehydrated when he thought he was dying, he came into a bait shop and found a server and met an old man who would give him the direction and decided that he better stick to the map.

Heat, hills and ghost towns are all features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him heatstroke. He begins to drink more often and almost lacks water. Next come the hills. They can take enormous amounts of energy to climb. Which adds to his dehydration. Finally the ghost towns.

In the story, the characteristics of the scenery affect the cyclist in several ways.

There were several characteristics of the frame that had an effect on the rider in this story. On the one hand, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert. This condition normally prevents getting water. Seeing that water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack of it because of the desert created the conflict of dehydration. In addition, the abandoned city sparked a spark of doubt in the mind of the cyclist. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope. By the time he reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now her head is screaming in annoyance and her body is screaming for lack of water. This abandoned juice factory has almost completely dashed the hopes of cyclists. A man is little or nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative effect on him. Now the only reason he continues is his desperation for survival, an instinct within all of us. In conclusion, the desert took away the water and the abandoned houses and factory took away hope and all three created a negative effect. The cyclist is lucky to have survived.

In the short story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows the characteristics of the framework being played which affects the rider in different ways. One parameter that the cyclist faces is that it is so hot that he continues to drink (drink) water and is afraid of running out. Kurmaskie writes, “I banged my water bottles quite regularly and traveled through the high deserts of California in @ NUM1). This is what affects the cyclist throughout the story when he realizes that he could die of heat stroke if he did not watch the amount of water he drinks. Also, this is what a lot of people are normally faced with which is a cause of dehydration.

Much about the setting in " Difficult Road: Do not exceed posted speed limit " affects the rider. The terrain of this story is hilly and filled with deserts. This contributes to the throbbing sensation of the cyclist for a glass of water. The walk on the hills and through the desert also tires him dramatically. Not to mention the fact that he is severely dehydrated and finds water "like tar" and "around two hundred degrees". The rider in this story must really want to get Yosemite National Park if he's ready to go. through all this trouble.

The setting of “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit ” affects the rider in so many ways. First, the cyclist rides in a desert in mid-June, the heat "starting to beat down" on him. This feature of the setting causes the rider to drink more water, but when his water supply was low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself. The cyclist began to realize that he "could be trapped with heat stroke on a beautiful day in June". @ CAPS1, the long distance and the changes in terrain the cyclist covered affected him. The distance the cyclist would travel to Yosemite National Park consisted of hours and kilometers of the ride. Over vast changes of terrain. The " flat road was replaced by short rolling hills " which affected the speed and energy of the cyclist to complete his journey.

Well, there are some characteristics of the setting like heat that affect the rider, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and drinking a lot of his water. So when he stopped at one place, the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could go to the other town to get some water. He started his journey on hilly and short roads. Then the road got bumpy. So know what we had anyway.

The character of this news has a plus that changes with his environment.

In Joe Kurmaskie's " Rough Road Ahead " essay, he accepts instructions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up riding a bike in a desert with no water, just barley capable of pushing the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist because it is so hot that he has nothing to drink, nowhere to find water or food and he may be seeing mirages. In the essay it is written: "Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that I could fall from heat stroke." It shows that the lack of water and the surrounding environment with nowhere to go are causing it to lose hope of survival. It also says in the essay : “ I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage and tried not to get too aroused. “The rider himself comes out and says the dessert makes him think he's seeing something and drops it because it's not real.

The characteristics of the frame have a great impact on the rider. One of the hallmarks is the hot weather and the region in which it is located. He says it is one of " California's great desserts in June ". @ CAPS1 being hot in @ CAPS2 there are cyclists around the deserts causing more heat. “I could have heatstroke,” he said. Being hot from the sun falling on him robbed the rider of the energy he needed to ride a bike. Another characteristic that affected the rider was his lack of water. "Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." This affected the cyclist by tiring him. Tired of the lack of water, the cyclist struggled to climb the slopes on his bike. The last feature that affected the rider was all the hills in his route. “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills. " These hills made it difficult to climb by bike, given its lack of water and heat.

Nature has an effect on everyone, even when they don't think so. Especially for cyclists traveling anywhere or anywhere. In “Do not exceed posted speed limit” by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example of parameters that affect people like cyclists. When riding a bicycle for transportation across the country, you need to know what you are doing and where you are going. The cyclist in this story decided to take the advice of older comrades and ended up taking the wrong lane for a cyclist because in these "towns" they had no water, because they weren't cities in the middle. departure, at least not anymore. If you don't have water like this guy the hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example. I picked up some pebbles and hit them in my mouth. I had read once that sucking stones helped relax. This guy knew a few survival tips. If he had come all this way without quenching his thirst and those hills, he probably would have had some sort of stroke. These are just a few of the ways this setting could harm you.

Part of the characteristics that affected the rider was that the seal was begging to be loaned out, but he really noticed it and about twenty miles down the road he sort of came to park. The cyclist was crossing the high deserts of California in June. He puts his hands together and works on the heated handle of the rusty pump. The pump started to spray a tar-like substance, and the water felt like two hundred degrees. Two more miles I noticed the terrain went from a flat road to short rolling hills. He said weeds crossed his path and a large snake crossed his sidewalk. He picks up some pebbles and puts them in his mouth, after reading that if sucking pebbles helps to stop thinking about thirst. Well after reading I thought these settings had an effect on the rider.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in many cases. First, the “city” that the cyclist first discovers is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist laughs, this decor shows the long journey that the cyclist has in mind. There were other characteristics that would negatively affect the rider. For example, “… I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. (page @ NUM1). Flat terrain is much easier for a cyclist to pedal. The shift from flat lands to hills affected his stamina and his will to continue. He really had to force himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination ultimately led him to “ Gary and Wilber's fish camp… ” (pg @ NUM2). He finally found hope.

In the Rugged Road story not exceeding the posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics had a more negative effect on the rider. The rider got tired from the big hills and he liked the scene which was only a good thing if it was the Hon. "The water bottle only contained a few sips of temptation." he didn't have enough water and he was thirsty. “At one point a ridiculously big snake, it really looked like a diamond back, blocked most of the sidewalk. " It's dangerous where it rolled and although it was by bike, there could have been bitten. All of these points that I have raised have shown the negative effect.

The desert land affected the cyclist by tiring him and causing him to lose body water, then causing him to need water to continue. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him weaker. If he didn't think about it, the ride wouldn't have been so rough

From the cyclist's perspective on his journey through Yosemite Park, the reader can get a good idea of what it might be like to ride right next to it. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride. He sees such a wide variety of landscapes including rivers, dry sandy deserts as well, as well as cool pines and trees in the part of the park. He said it was also windy which probably made for a pleasant temperature.

The characteristics of the Yosemite bike ride through California in June affect the cyclist. Some of the features were that it was hot in the high deserts and there was no water. This affected the author making him dehydrated and tired, making it impossible for him to find water or travel to Yosemite. In this case, the outhor says "The sun was beating down on me". The author is warm From the sun. He said, "The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips." He shows he has no water and is probably dehydrated.

In the “ Do not exceed posted speed limit ” test, there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the rider. Many of these characteristics affect it negatively. One of these characteristics is the hills present in the test. These probably infuriated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" "The speed limit was @ NUM1. I was doing a @ NUM2 which depletes water. Sometimes life can seem so cruel. The author / cyclist probably had the impression that there never happen. in addition, the sign announcing the grape juice has probably made him feel that life was even more cruel to his sadistic irony. Finally, the store bait offered a lot of relief to the rider. “I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them and buy bait.” Overall, the setting affected the rider quite negatively until after at the end.

Many characteristics of the frame affected the rider. First of all, the heat was the main part of nature that put him off. This caused him to become dehydrated from the lack of water and he got a bit diligent. He believed he saw things and his vision was distorted. Then the water he must have found in the pump was not drinkable because of the tarry substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said to be, which was @ NUM1 degree. Finally, the Welch's factory he met was teasing him by telling him he couldn't get the fluids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his chilled Welch's juice. Not only did the rider deviate from the trail because the directions, the setting made his bike adventure in Yosemite even more unbearable.

The setting affects the rider in several ways, firstly because it is very hot in the desert. Second, there aren't many cities. Lastly is that water is hard to find there, so if he is thirsty it would be hard to get more water if you couldn't find a town.

The frame affects the rider in almost everything they do and everything they do. The setting is a hot June day for dessert. There are a lot of hills and the terrain changes several times. Because the day is hot, the cyclist drinks a lot of water. And because he drinks a lot of water, he gets exhausted very quickly. In the story it is written, “ I knocked my water bottles quite regularly and traveled through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot the cyclist drank a lot of water and because he drank a lot of water he ran out of water very quickly. Also in the story, it is said that " the flat road was replaced by short rolling hills ". This quote suggests that because the terrain turned into hills, the rider became very tired and burning from pedaling up and down those hills. And because it made him hot and tired, he also drank his water faster than pedaling a flat paved road on a cool day at @ DATE1. In conclusion, the adjustment causes fatigue, heat and thirst in the rider, which affects their entire ride.

The characteristics of the story setting affect the cyclist in describing that they are in a desert area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There aren't many places to cool off either. They also described the water and the Lodi as having a temperature of about @ NUM1 degree. The rider was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and have cool, shady pine trees to sit under and cool cool water. It affects the rider as he becomes dehydrated from the horrible heat.

The characteristics of the frame have an important effect on the rider. If a cyclist was cycling in the snow, he or she could eat the snow without becoming dehydrated.

The conditions for the cyclist in the story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " are quite dangerous. "a ridiculously big snake blocked most of the pavement balance, my dehydrated bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips" (kurmaskie, @ NUM1). There was a fairly large snake in its path. You can tell he's not an expert on snakes because he couldn't identify him. Because he's in the desert on a long bike ride, he's dehydrated. Its water supply is almost exhausted. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey.

The characteristics of the setting that affect the rider are terrain, lack of provisions and the power of self-determination. The terrain affected the cyclist, causing him to take rough paths to reach his destination. For example, if you walk over sharp rocks, you are based on reaching rough spots where it seems like you can't walk. But that's where self-determination comes in. The power to keep moving forward even though there are @ MONTH1 obstacles in your path ; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end another example of a characteristic is a lack of provisions on your trip, when you don't have the right provisions to stay energized you cannot overcome your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything.

In "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that " I had knocked my water bottles fairly regularly and was traveling through the high deserts of California in June " (Kurmaskie). This shows that he drank his water too quickly due to the desert heat in the summer. After traveling for a long time without water, he lets out a chuckle, thinking he shouldn't have taken the advice of the old men. He explains that "it was a sad, desperate laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself." This is an example of how the terrain had affected him. It touched him so much that he applauded himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because the rider is already tired and thirsty. Features include a California desert setting, it is extremely hot, there is no sign of civilization in sight, and the roads are like hills that have always been in the wilderness. In addition to these facts, the cyclist becomes dehydrated because his water has supposedly decreased.

Adjusting the short cut affected the rider in several ways. For example, he said that there was rusty water and "it tasted like battery acid" because of it, he couldn't drink it, which did. become dehydrated. Also in the story is said, “the flat roads were replaced by short hills. It could have made the ride even more difficult for the cyclist as now he had a little more effort to climb the hills. Another example is towards the end, he says "I started to divide my trip into distances, I could see the horizon thinking I could make it." When the cyclist says this, it looks like he has given up and he realizes that this journey will never end until his death. This is how the setting of the story affected the cyclist.

Certain characteristics of the frame affected the rider. The hills, the poisonous snake, and the road conditions worried him. For example, @ CAPS1 said, “ I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean, leaving only expensive outdoor gear and the newspaper.

In " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " by @ PERSON1, the characteristics of the setting greatly affect the rider. The first major example is when the cyclist sees that the flat road turns into “ short, rolling hills”, these hills increase the difficulty and make him doubt that he will succeed. Another part of the scenery that caused major doubt was that it was in a wasteland. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." The horizon was what moved the cyclist forward. "I started to break the ride in disarray : I could see the horizon, telling myself that if I could go that far, everything would be fine." The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the frame, he wouldn't have been in such a serious situation, but luckily in the end, the frame helped him be determined enough to make it happen.

No cars, buildings or anything. He was getting sad and dehydrated. The old men swore that there was a city to come so he put his trust in himself once more. He saw a building go up , but it was just a dilapidated old factory. He thought he had been disappointed. He was sure he was going to die right now. He then saw a siga for a model fish !

The characteristics of the frame in Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit. » Affects the cyclist in several ways. First in the essay, when the @ CAPS1 says it's in the deserts of California, it can have an impact as it gives them a sense of the likely heat and how the lack of water can really harm someone. Also, when the @ CAPS1 describes water pumps and what comes out of them, it can give the rider a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good supply of water.

Many things in the "Do not exceed posted speed limit" test affected the rider throughout his trip. A very important part that greatly affected the rider is the fact that he was in a desert without a good supply of water. Another part One of the factors that put the rider to the test was the length of his journey. These two factors combined in his journey to Yosemite are probably the worst and most difficult that affected the rider.

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider because. It was a lack of water and he was in the high deserts or in California. For example in the text says "when I tried a drop or two it tasted like battery acid." This clearly showed, when he tried to get water from a pump, what was coming out of it clearly, as the settling was extremely hot and made the rider uncomfortable in this way.    

<START>

 

In the story, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider as there is little he can rely on. For example, it is the desert and generally there is nothing there. The rider has only a limited amount of what they need and riding there does not help. For example, the old men who gave him instructions made him think he could do it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his trip his lack of water slowed him down and made him think that he would not make it. When he finally got to "Gary & Wilber's Fishing Camp" he learned a lesson because when an old man asked him if he knew the fastest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a really good card. ''

In many real-life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest obstacle to success or even survival. For example, the cyclist weathered the searing heat of the sun while pedaling through what appeared to be @ CAPS1's living room : dry, sorry and extremely contemptuous. "Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day." @ CAPS2 and depicts the intense heat of the desert. Another feature of the setting were the hills and hanging steps, although pedaling the hills was an easier task, going up the hill, as well as maneuvering thirsts and turns served as direct conflict. An example, “with what I thought was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered a setting that affects a situation and ultimately the rider reaches his destination is a great relief. But the biggest obstacle was along its frame.

First, by accepting the advice of the elders, the cyclist was preparing for things that he could easily have avoided by using his card. He first meets a "ghost town", lifeless and above all, without water. Then he encounters a pump which gives water that tastes "battery acid". Then it passes a " Rough Road Ahead " sign ; not the most encouraging thing about his journey. To add to the desperation, he has to make his way past a tempting but empty juice factory.

The old men ended by leading him into the middle of the desert. In the desert, the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water. There was no sign of civilization whatsoever. These hot conditions made the rider very hot, tired and very thirsty. But that didn't stop him, he continued and eventually he arrived in a small town where he was able to drink cool water and take a well-deserved rest.

Throughout most of history, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider in a more negative way. For example, it happens in this town that a guy swore to be there, but it turned out to be abandoned. So he let out a sad, desperate laugh and still had the energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the also abandoned Grape Juice Factory, so he bowed his head and that “ summer time ” blues tune shook in his brain. A third characteristic was his thirst. So he put pricks in his mouth to clear his mind. Then he thought about how lucky he would be if he checked, @ CAPS1 negative for me.

The characteristics of the test affect the rider in many cases because he gets terrain and drinks more and more water. The roads are getting difficult, so he has to slow down.

The characteristics of this frame affect the author when riding a bicycle. They turned his hope into doubt. There were no buildings or cars, which led him to believe he would never make it to Yosemite. Also, there was rough terrain that made him doubt he would ever get water.

Rider and Rider Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit has been affected by the setting. The "California deserts in June" tired him very easily. The change in terrain from the flat road to the hills made him less confident because he felt the traffic sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT exceed 55 mph. He could only go to @ NUM1.

I think there were a lot of things that contributed to the condition of the cyclists at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time.

So if you put it all together. He was riding his bike on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These @ NUM1 things all contributed to the condition of the characters. He went through dead towns looking for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, which tasted like battery acid. He drank too much water at first, which left him just spitting up towards the end. He was lucky enough to find a fishing camp in the middle of nowhere and find some water.

This cyclist took the advice of old men who thought they knew a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. This shortcut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought a certain number of water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The frame of this story has changed a lot , sometimes forcing the rider to pedal faster and slower. The cyclist quickly exhausted himself and began to lose hope in himself. The terrain kept changing, making it difficult for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or heat stroke.

At first the motorcyclist "rode in the morning ... with a smile" because of the bright sun, and the "cool pines" and rushing rivers "... he is very confident with the ancient directions of men, this first Sign of disappointment occurs when he comes to the "dilapidated shed ..." and the "sight of this was disturbing ..." to him, but he continued on his way. He thinks as he rides the "Chilling Hills" that maybe it wasn't such a good idea. Finally, he arrives in an old bait shop and the " modern bathroom " he walks into to drink the relief of the desert he has just crossed.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider. The landscape was difficult to navigate, there was intense heat and little water. As a result, it was a long journey and he struggled to reach his destination.  

<START>

 

At first, the trip was easy and flat. It was a beautiful day and the water was flowing. Soon the path turned into hills and quickly got rough. Even though the pines provided shade, it was not enough to help the rider. Eventually he reached a certain civilization after enduring a grueling ascent and cycling through the woods.

The essay on "Rough Road Ahead" deals with the dangers of speed and aggression. It just lets you follow the instructions and read the signs. You should always keep @ NUM1 / = near signs and things.   

<START>

 

The setting that affected the rider was water temperature, hills, and road conditions. Water was a factor because he needed cool water to stay hydrated, he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started to pump the water, it was hot but he took it, he tried to let it cool but it didn't work. Rolling hills were another source of difficulty for cyclists as the road started out flat and then ended with rolling hills which can strain the leg and make it more difficult to continue riding. Another difficulty was the condition of the road, it was smooth at the start, then it got rough and rocky. This was some of the effects the cyclist had to overcome     

<START>

 

The setting depends on how you can go or move around. The hills of the city helped the cyclist. The hills did not. The cyclist had a bad idea or aditude when he saw the towns he was upset and mad for not wanting to die and yet he thought. He was going two. He said he would no longer trust old people. They didn't know what they were talking about. How and why did he trust even in the first place.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example, “ I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. " This quote shows that the environment caused him difficulty and a challenge for travel. By describing the hills as "rolling" it helps the reader to imagine the obstacles he was going through. In addition, the sign indicating “ Route difficult to travel ; Do not exceed the posted speed limit. " Gives the reader the feeling that the character is in danger. Finally, an example of the setting that helps show the character's struggles is "person in sight, not a building, car, or structure by any hand." If something were to happen to the character, as the author foreshadowed, he would be stranded and all alone to die. He would be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily imagine the difficulties he had to overcome. In conclusion, these examples added emphasis and meaning to the text.

Well, the characteristics of the tuning affect the rider in several ways. Now, when his water was hot to drink, he took some pebbles and put them in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that it will dilute your saliva. The terrain in the story was very rocky and hilly. These are the characteristics of the terrain.    

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. The hills affected the cyclist because they would be more difficult for him to climb. The abandoned city also affected him. When he got to town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break, but when he got there the town was abandoned. In addition, the highway was difficult for him because it would be difficult for him to drive over it. Also, there was nowhere he could find water around him. Many features of the frame affected it.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the decor gradually contribute to the anger of the cyclist. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, "a ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps and a corral which could not contain a single mule". All the sights confuse the narrator, and he begins to get scared and neurotic. As he continues, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops replenishing, "the water was not cooling" and "it tasted like battery acid." The cyclist's lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing slope of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist drove past what he "thought was a Welch's grape juice factory". The narrator continues with indignation to explain that he hopes to die on the road, in order to spare himself the dreaded features of the decor.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider the most as they travel. The rider is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he is placed in really gives him no hope of survival. He first arrives in a "ghost town" where he discovers that no one lives. This first encounter with isolation in a desolate place does not really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the set of the story comes to mimic him. During his journey, he encounters an arid land, without water and without anyone in sight. It is June in California and the cyclist is worried that he will soon suffer from heat stroke @ MONTH1 if he cannot find water yet. It doesn't help when he arrives at an abandoned juice factory taunting him with the only thing he needs to survive. All in all, the characteristics of the decor make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel that he is going to die if he does not find water.       

<START>

 

The setting for the story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " was based on the hot, dry terrain of California. This setting affected the character's mood. It did so because some of its included features can feel like real metaphorical moods. An example from the story is “ The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite ... ” This quote from the story might suggest the tone and feel of the landscape that would be calm and relaxed. So from the scene seen and the vibe that she has, that would also give the character her mood.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame that affect riders depend on where they are. In this story, the feeling of " nothing and the desert around him and the heat gave him no hope ". It all depends on where you are riding your bike. "It didn't really matter that I was going to die." This quote expresses his feelings about what was going on in his head as he was dying of thirst. He didn't feel anything, he was sure he was going to die until he found a sign of near civilization and improved and his hope increased.

I think the characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. The long, hot, lonely drive there had an effect on him. It scared him, which made him last longer. He had nothing to drink and thought he was going to die, it made him weak. The snake on the path stretched him and every stop that once stood there forced him to do so.    

<START>

 

I think even riding a bike for that long can be bad for the butt. But also a good exercise especially for the legs all the strength you get from the muscle. Knowing where you are going could take forever. But I know what they would have to do in all types of weather, but as long as you have some material on you, no harm could happen to you.

At first he was mad because he took advice from old men who never left their porch. He was afraid of dying because he had drunk all his water and he didn't know how long it would take before he had more. He shouldn't have been drinking his water so quickly knowing that he had time. Then he became happy when he saw the sign of the bait. He quickly cycled down the hill.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider, in the story Do not exceed the posted speed limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the surroundings are depressing and frightening. When the rider first sees the 55 mph speed limit sign, he says, "Sometimes life can be so cruel". Because he can only go 12 mph given that he is on a bicycle. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses its path. He's scared of it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and get past it. Since the main problem the cyclist faces is the lack of water, the long, dry hills seem to make them weaker and more tired. Weeds passed in front of him and there was no water in sight. This is how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider. It caused him to become dehydrated. For example, in the @ NUM1 sentence @ NUM2 paragraph, he said "I calmed down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." This shows how the heat and climate of the environment affected him by how unbalanced he was and exhausts him to become dehydrated. The frame of the story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the rider in the story.

The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist. It's extremely hot now in California as the narrator helps him ride. This causes him to become elated much faster while on a "short stroke" leading nowhere. " Large signs of dried out outcast breathed my member and the growing awareness I might fall from ?? a wonderful day in June ”This gust shows how calm this day was and the fact that the cyclist is sweating so much shows how the weather affects him. The rolling hills of history also affect the cyclist. Going up and down infrequently, it made her trip more secure. It intimidated him even longer to get to a city with water. Knowledge dropped in the frame also negatively affected the narrator. This gave her a hopeless narrative as there was no place to stop and run out of her water supply.

Joe Kurmaskie struggled to get to Yosemite National Park. First he got instructions from an old man, Joe followed those instructions; he didn't know he was heading for many trials. After reaching the first town, he checked his supplies. About @ NUM1 more miles he thought his bottle was getting low because he was traveling through the high deserts of California. It's hot and cool there, then the terrain has changed. He didn't have as much water. He hit a snake, which he swore to be an almond back. Eventually he came to another town, got some water and then left after passing through ghost towns. Riding in hot and unfamiliar conditions is difficult to do. Adding hills to the heat is not a good combination, with nothing around it can be very dangerous, even fatal. Before cycling, think about the conditions that await you

Whenever the perpetrator comes to a point where the setting is not very attractive or useful, he loses hope of reaching his destination or of finding a pleasant place to rest and catch some fresh water. For example, the text states: “A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that could not contain the most crappy mule greeted me. This sight was disturbing ”(Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point. It shows that he is frustrated and that he is losing some hope. He also mentions that "the view was disturbing," which shows how the features around him or the landscape can have a significant effect.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. First of all he is crossing a desert in California in June so the weather is extremely hot and the cyclist needs water, but since he lacks the water he brought with him he cannot find d other water himself so he's thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, if he frustrates him, when he finds water not only is it hot, it tastes like battery acid @ CAPS1, when the rider decides to save some of his water and going to the next town to get more, but there is another setback. The condition of the road is so bad that the cyclist cannot go faster than 20 km / h. So if he ever reaches the next town. it will have to wait even longer for the much-needed water, traveling at 12 mph.

The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from old people whose information was not correct. Then he cycled along the desert which was very hot. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him very badly. He almost got heatstroke a few times. He was probably angry that he took the advice of these men and went into this. Then, when he found the fishing camp, he was delighted with relief. But at the same time, if he'd asked someone else for directions, he wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place. So it's really confusing because he probably felt relived and crazy at the same time. And then the other old man asked him if he knew the best way to get there. He was right to say yes because if he hadn't, the old man would have given him an even more complicated direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heatstroke. .

In the essay, "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit", is about a man following in wrong directions and in the middle of a desert is stuck without water. He begins to lack confidence in the directions when the scenery changes. He said: "After forty miles of pedaling, I came to the first town that met the traditional definition of a ghost town." He had been told it was a prosperous city, but he had nothing. It was a big disappointment and the rider was not so convinced that it had been the right choice. He continues to drive and discovers another disturbing sight. A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that would not fit in a single mule greeted me. "@ CAPS1 was another deemed good place, but all he got was flavored water from the drums. On the home stretch of his bike he encountered some rugged hills, a snake looking diamond and an abandoned juice factory.

Setting features such as the scorching sun, lack of water and ' Gary and Wilber's fish camp ' greatly affected the rider. Since the rider was riding through the high desserts of California in June, the temperature was very high and the scorching sun left "large rings of dried sweat" on his shirt and made the rider understand that he could fall from a heatstroke. Also, the fact that the only water around smelled "somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees" and "tasted like battery acid" prevented the rider from drinking it and put him in a "dehydrated state". @ CAPS1, "Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp" affected the rider by solving his dehydration problem as there was cold water available on arrival.

The cyclist struggled to find the water he needed and believed he was in danger of dying of heat stroke under these conditions. There were also hills. The cyclist said he had to cross "a long crippling hill". From my experiences as a cyclist, hills are the worst, especially if you are thirsty.

He "travels through the high deserts of California in June", and it really makes him thirsty. "[He] was hitting [his] water bottles quite regularly" because of this. Later, he runs out of water and becomes desperate. He becomes desperate because there is no building or establishment in sight. Therefore, no water and there is no place to get water. Another feature of the decor that affects him is the people who gave him instructions. They told him to wait for the whistle, and he listened. It went through everything, and he remained desperate. Another feature is Gary and Wilber's fish camp. This led him to look for water. It affected his mood because he had hope again.

In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Staying Within The Posted Speed Limit," the setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way he had problems, the fact that there is not much civilization affected the cyclist as he could not fill his bottles with water, so he was very thirsty. Also, the many hills and the fact that it was summer hit him a lot as he got tired more easily and couldn't pedal that fast. When he said, "A tar-like substance oozed out would not cool," it showed that he was not able to drink. Also, when he walked past the grape juice factory, it must have been torture for him since he was so thirsty. If he hadn't followed the men's advice in the first place, he would have had a much shorter ride and wouldn't have been so exhausted. The frame affected the rider a lot in this test.

I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean… ”The heat must have been bad, he was not thinking correctly and was slowly entering a mental center!

Arrived at a place where he saw a building above the hills, he "managed" his way down, only to find it long deserted and himself on the verge of despair. He was desperate for the water he needed soon. Finally he stumbled upon "@ CAPS1 and Wilber's Fish Camp" and quenched his thirst and was relieved.

The characteristics of the “ DO NOT exceed the posted speed limit ” story setting affect the rider in the story in several ways. The first of these would certainly be the cyclist's lack of water and the fact that there was none for miles. According to the text, it was written, “ There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. " This evidence proves the text to the reader that the cyclist was concerned. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot and relentless desert. "Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day." The author here, using the elements of nature, tries to make the reader concerned / afraid of the main character. The final key was to travel and road conditions. Although the desert was flat, he began to notice a few hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be fatal. The elements of the scenery greatly affect the cyclist in this story.

Dry, thirsty, tedious, so many tuning characteristics that affect the rider. First of all, everything is dry. The cyclist is nowhere near a town that could help him.

The cyclist takes the directions of older guys who look like they haven't left their porch in ages. He follows their advice and then sucks in the long run because he can't find any water and it's hot @ DATE1. He climbs climbs under the scorching sun and fears heatstroke. There was no view, not a building, a car.      

<START>

 

The adjustment will either affect the rider the right way or the wrong way. In Joe Kurmaskie's "Rough Road Ahead" story, this affects the rider in the wrong way and in the right way. In the story, we continue to talk about lack of water. “When I tried a drop or two it tasted like battery (NUM1). It shows that the heat warmed the water, so it didn't cool it. But a good way to affect them is pebbles. ”I once read that sucking pebbles helps quench thirst by allowing @ NUM2 to spit out what you have left. This shows that even if he has no water, pebbles can make him less thirsty. This is how the tuning affects the rider in a good way and in a bad way.      

<START>

 

In this story, it is clear how difficult the journey of cyclists is. He must overcome the wrong directions, lack of water, rattlesnakes and fear of Dieng. However, he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is “The old folks swore that the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could do that. “It shows his determination that he feels he can take such a long trip. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @ NUM1 and @ NUM2. Finding this abandoned building, and all things, the juice , anyone who would use would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist, he was controlling his anger and showing determination again. And it paid off in the end, he found his water and survived. This story is a big one. story that shows determination and self-control.

Early in the morning the cyclist is impatient and ready to tackle the adventurous path that had been blazed by older travelers. He barely noticed that "the sun was starting to strike." He was calm and eagerly awaited the "cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite." He had never imagined what he had gotten himself into. As he began to approach the desert, he noticed that there was a lack of water. The intense cycling activity combined with the scorching desert heat began to take effect. The cyclist needed water so badly that he had to put stones in his mouth. He had once read: " that sucking stones helps you stop thinking about thirst by allowing the saliva you have left to circulate ". The cyclist hoped for a way out of the misery he had encountered. The dehydration took its toll and he hallucinated. He was starting to lose hope. The heat, hills and lack of water had the biggest impact on the rider. If he hadn't walked through a hilly desert on a June afternoon, he would have been fine.              

<START>

 

In the history of the cyclist , the setting had a huge impact on how the story came to light. The water had a lot of effect on the cyclist. The setting for the story took place in the high deserts of California in June. As soon as you read it you now something is wrong.In the story he said , the sun has begun to beat a low .This is going to affect him because hes riding through the desert on a bike, that which causes him to become dehydrated .I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.Thes begining to lose his mind because he has no water because of the setting.Everything the subject of tuning causes the cyclist a little problems.The heat, tuning, lack of water almost makes him his life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

<START>

 

The adjustment affects the rider in several ways. The first is that he was driving in the middle of a desert in June. If he drove @ LOCATION1 it wouldn't be too hot. Plus the rolling hills probably didn't help. If it was mostly downhills it would have been nice. Cycling up a hill when you are tired is almost impossible.

In the story “ Don't exceed the posted speed limit ” by Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics of the path leading to @ ORGANIZATION2 greatly affected the rider. On the way to the park, the cyclist came across a large snake covering the road, which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road was not the most comfortable to ride. In Joe Kurmaskie's story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the characteristics of the path leading to Yosemite National Park greatly affected the rider. On the way to the park, the cyclist came across a large snake covering the road, which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road was not the most comfortable to ride. There was nothing for the cyclist to see. The cyclist did not have a lot of energy because he had no hope for him. The author declares: “ ... to rise while losing hope. " Finally, the time was warm and dry, which tired the cyclist. He had no water with him and over time he had neither the energy nor the hope to help him on his journey to Yosemite National Park.                    

<START>

 

In the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit, the cyclist has expired several times endangering his life during his adventure. The first characteristic was when was in a desert with temptations of @ NUM1 degrees and his little lit water tasted like battery acid. As he tried to continue he lost hope and thought he was going to die. This affected him because as he lost hope he thought more negatively about the things and didn't think he would pull it off, but he had the agility to move on. In this story, the setting greatly affects the characters.    

<START>

 

The characteristic of the frame makes the rider frustrated, thirsty and confused. The features make him frustrated that he thought he was going the right way where he was really going. 

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because the characteristics are what causes the climax of the story. An example of this would be the phrase, " I had knocked my water bottles fairly regularly and was traveling through the high deserts of California." " This line shows that the author was in a hot place, being in a desert, but it has a low water supply. These two conditions are the cause of climax, which is the possibility that it could collapse every minute due to heat exhaustion. This is why the characteristics of the frame affect the rider.        

<START>

 

Certain characteristics of the decor affected the cyclist. In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, he describes his experiences when he cycled through the desert. "... arrived at the first town" ... that fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. At first the rider was amused by this town and maybe a little nervous because the old "codgers" told him it was booming. Halfway through his trip, he said " life can be so cruel sometimes ". The water was running out and he still had a way to go until he got to the park and he felt like it would never end. All he sees around him as hills of nothingness beneath the burning son with his limited amount of water. There are no buildings around the cyclist. The ghost town and lack of shade or solution are features of the setting that make this rider feel like a jerk for taking advice from older men.                    

<START>

 

I'll explain how the rider's tuning affected him. The rider's setting affected him by making him very hot and drinking his water and he would soon run out of water and become dehydrated. For example, in the story, the cyclist always brought what little water he had left and around the test he spoke of the dehydration he saw and even death. Another example is the relief he got when he drank the water from the sink. In conclusion, this is how the tuning affected the rider.

This paragraph indicates how careful you have to be on the roads. It also talks about what you need to be aware of. There is so much that could happen. You have to take control when you are on the road.

The features of the setting in " Do not exceed posted speed limit " by Joe Kurmaskie affect the rider in several ways. For example, he states that "This place could have been a small prosperous place before the last world war, it met the traditional definition of a ghost town." This statement is about the city he arrived in while trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the rider as he was riding confidently at first, but the first town he came to looks like a ghost town, which would take his confidence a bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they get to a place they know they won't feel so confident. Another example is when he has to drive over rolling hills, and then he comes across a sign " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ". It would affect the rider because then he would be frustrated and stressed because he has come all this way and he can't go any further, and that's not where he wanted to be. Therefore, the characteristics of the setting in " Do not exceed posted speed limit " by Joe Kurmaskie affects the rider.

The conditions the rider faced that affected their trip were various things that could really ruin your ride. Some conditions were hot. It was very hot and that made it difficult to think fast, go fast and make good decisions. So he's not going anywhere in a hurry. there were also some hills which made driving uncomfortable and tiring. On top of that he was fresh out of the water and it can mean further dehydration, judgment of the buds and even heat stroke or exoustion, another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere, so it's not like he can stop. Some where we ask for a drink, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the driving was because these conditions existed.      

<START>

 

The setting was very hot and dry and was a desert. This setting affected him even though it made him very gaunt and scorching. It was very difficult for him to go to fourth but he knew he had to keep going. Also the earth was very barin and eth around. Clearly the setting affected the rider.    

<START>

 

The frame affected the rider because he was in California in June and was traveling back and forth with no place to stop for water, if the rider had followed the path he intended to follow, it probably would have been nicer to have had to worry about heatstroke or running out of water, everything would have been fine.

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. Hills and rocks would make it much harder to stay strong and be able to keep rolling. The abandoned building and the absence of people could affect him emotionally. It would make him lose hope and the determination to continue to find a destination. He didn't think he would get this after seeing a deserted town. After all, he said, “It didn't really matter. I was going to die… ”(Kurmaskie).       

<START>

 

The main features of the setting that affected the rider are the fact that it was June and the heat of the dessert. "... I could have heatstroke on a beautiful June day ..." (kurmaskie @ NUM1). It helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of California dessert. This affected the cyclist with his dehydration and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere with no one to help him. This is how the month of June and the heat of the dessert affected the cyclist.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider in this story. First of all, when he got to the sign for ' Rough Road Ahead ' he was already out of water, but that only made matters worse. The bumpy road prevented him from pedaling; therefore, he was working harder and was thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch Grape Juice Factory, he noticed pebbles on the ground and pushed them into his mouth. "I read once that sucking stones helps you stop thinking about thirst by letting your remaining saliva circulate." Finally, “GARY AND WILBER'S FISH CAMP” could have saved the cyclist's life. He stopped there and finally got a well-deserved glass of water to calm his dehydration and fear. The setting and the characteristics strongly affected the rider throughout his journey.

In “ Rough Road Ahead : Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit ,” the characteristics of the setting affect how the perpetrator feels. At the start of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is “a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, Calif.” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). It seems like a great place to cool off and feel confident. Later in the bike ride, the author is negatively affected by the arid zone he is traveling to when he says: "This sight was disturbing" (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). Finally, when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved because of the modern facility. when he says, " So, as easily as in a bend, my problems, my thirst and my fear were all behind me " (Kurmaskie @ NUM3). The area the author crosses has an effect         

<START>

 

The peculiarities of the frame affect the cyclist because he does not ride as much and does not know the best routes to take. So they just go back to their old roads, thinking that they are still the best way, but when they use them they realize how tiring and bad they are.

"At one point, tumbleweeds crossed my path ..." being in the desert with little or no water can make life seem very cruel. The sun was beating down and no water or shadow is seen when it reaches a point. The sign saying “ Rough @ CAPS1 in front ; Do not exceed the posted speed limit. must have been intimidating. Considering he was on a bicycle, he could only move so fast. These old men had probably never left their porch since Carter had been in office. yes as the writer said “the world is a fluid place. Things are changing. The old men probably had almost no reason for what they were talking about, considering that things have changed since @ NUM1 (when Carter was in office). The snake he encountered must have been rather intimidating. Knowing that there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more. In eseance I think the frame was an important part that the rider felt that way

From what's in this picture, the rider is riding on dry, dry terrain which could mean it's very good and the rider seems to be going down a hill, there appear to be a lot of turns. From the position of the cyclist's body, he seems to be doing his best to reach his destination. This could all be stressful for the rider maybe he is sweating very hard and maybe tired from the wind @ MOIS1 does not help at all.

In the new "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit" @ PERSON1 of a cyclist crosses an extreme climate and rugged terrain that puts almost end his life to get to its destination. After receiving outdated instructions from the elderly, the protagonist begins his journey to Yosemite National Park. Shortly after, the cyclist notices that something is wrong. The first "town" locals said they would find is deserted. And now, twenty miles after the start of his journey, the cyclist must recharge some of his water supply. The water pump has " the flavor of battery acid ." With the next town at NUM1 miles away, the cyclist is struggling to conserve their water to get there. Even then, things get worse. As it stands, "traveling through the high deserts of California in June", "the flat road has been replaced by short hills". @ CAPS1 tells him not to exceed @ NUM2's speed limit as he is doing a "water run out @ NUM3". finally, even after a few sips of water, the cyclist finds a place to fill up with water, now knowing how to set off again in better days and in better directions.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider. When she was riding, it was very hot, which made the cyclist lose energy and become dehydrated. Also when the cyclist has undergone a change of terrain. The road turned into hills. This caused the rider fatigue, because after going up and down your body gets tired. Also, since the weather was so hot, the rider drank a lot of water. Eventually, she exhausted herself and then became dehydrated. This whole situation meant sticking to your original plan. If the cyclist had done this, she would not have had to go through the trials.

Every new feature in Joe Kurmaskie's “ Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit ” test frame affects the rider in one way or another. For example, in the text, when the narrator said he had to avoid a " ridiculously large snake " from crossing the road, he became more aware of his surroundings and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until. what he finally accepts the great reptile. Also in the text, when "on a long crippling hill a building appeared," hope was restored in the cyclist. This hope allowed the narrator to be more tenacious in his journey to arrive at the old building. Eight for better or for worse, a few peculiarities of the tuning happen and affect the rider every step of the way.

Many features of the cyclist's excruciating journey setting affect him mentally and physically. When he first left, pines and rivers made him ride happily across the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his fatigue and thirst. When the cyclist encounters rough terrain with weeds and snakes, he is mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his conscience and worries that he @ MOIS1 does not complete the trip. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a disappointment for the mental state of the cyclist. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally falls on the water and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame had an effect on the rider. I know because in the story the cyclist said he was "going to fall because of the heat", he crosses the desert at @ DATE1, and he took instructions from three old "gentlemen" sitting on a porch. 

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider. First, since he was in a desert, the heat of the desert has considerably dehydrated him during his trip to the regions. Additionally, the bumpy roads and rolling hills slowed the bike to 12mph as it was too extreme for it to handle at high speeds. When he sees the fist building because his fist is relived but shortly after he loses all hope because he is served. Even the old men who live in the area have an effect on the cyclist as they give him outdated instructions which are almost @ CAPS1. For this reason, it will probably first rest on an old man's short tents again. This is how the characteristics of the frame affected the rider.      

<START>

 

Well, first of all, his very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily. And the hills are hard to climb so it would be a challenge to get to the top. All I know is that lack of water can kill you if you get heatstroke easily.

In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics of the framework affect the cyclist. At first, the cyclist thought the trip he was about to take was going to be good, but that is changing quickly. For example, " Never accept travel advice from a collection of elders who have not left the confines of their front porch since Carter was in power." " This quote tells how early the rider thought that his trip would be good, but information from two old quickly changed that.

The tuning characteristics affect the rider in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain they have to cycle on make them more prone to thirst and exhaustion. The heat @ MONTH1 causes the cyclist to become dehydrated faster than normal. This is especially true in this case due to its lack of water. The cyclist could pass out or suffer heat stroke. The hilly terrain will tire the rider more quickly than if they were still on the flat road. Her muscles will start to become ocha and her body will need water and rest. The story would totally change if the setting were different. If the cyclist was cycling on @ DATE1 on a cold day in the middle of @ NUM1, there would be no chance of heatstroke. He would be much less likely to become dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything.

In Joe Kurmaskie's essay " Rough Road Ahead ", the speaker rides his bike through rough terrain in scorching heat, not to mention long distances. He must ascend and descend small and large hills across what he believes to be a shortcut to his destination. It has a limited water supply and it continues to pass through ghost towns, where the only boiling water is brackish water unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst tuning feature for this guy as Welch's Grape Juice Factory (discontinued of course). Adding salt to the wound was " A shortbread photo of a young boy pouring a glass of refreshing juice into his mouth was still visible " (kurmaskie @ NUM1). For the narrator whose water supply was dwindling, this billboard was particularly intimidating for him on his journey.         

<START>

 

Desert, hills, road conditions and lack of water, this is how the setting affected the rider. First, the cyclist reveals he's in the desert when he exclaims, "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." It means it was hot. Second, the hills and the state of the roads were horrendous. The cyclist reveals this when he describes: " the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills ", helps again . Finally, He had thought that he would have stops along the way to get some water. So he drank all the rate he wanted. He then understood the need to keep it, but by then it was too late. The examples show that the condition of the cyclists was more difficult than expected.            

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. The winding road could affect his turns as he could turn one way and fall off his bike and be seriously injured. Another feature that could affect the rider is the grass on both sides of the road. If he gets tired of taking a shortcut and sinks into the grass, he could hit a rock, drop his bike and be injured. This is what the characteristic of the setting could affect the rider.

The setting the cyclist was in was a California desert in mid-June. He thinks he is going to die near the end because of the instructions he has received. "Never accept travel advice from a collection of elders who have not left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office." This means to never take instructions from people who have not been to the place for a while.

The setting was a hot desert in California where a biker got stranded on his way to Yosemite National Park. These settings were tough on the rider. For example, he listened to old people who drove him the wrong way and could have had him killed. He was running out of water and his legs looked like they were going to break. All of these issues affected his confidence in the former inhabitants, however. He learns that just because they are old and seem wise, they have information probably older than artefacts in a museum. In addition, he has a confidence card: he got a lot out of this trip.      

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example, in "ghost towns" there is no one to ask directions or to talk to. Additionally, some of the water pumped by water pumps tastes like "battery acid" and could most likely make someone sick. There are also poisonous snakes and other dangerous animals.   

<START>

 

There are a lot of characteristics in the story, "that affect roles, like out of the water, wrong directions. The narrator is ??? and says," the water bottles contain a few mouthwatering sips. he has no more water and must continue until he finds some.

<START>

 

In this @ ORGANIZATION1 I will explain how the characteristics of the frame affected the rider. In the new "Rough Road To Head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" The whole event takes place in the "high desert of California." @ CAPS1 to the text that the cyclist had taken the "obsolete" direction of the elderly who thought they had just discovered the route. The cyclist encountered a snake, a ghost town, and a closed factory. Most of the time the cyclist passed overhead.    

<START>

 

The "Do not exceed posted speed limit" setting adds drama to the story because of how it affects the rider. He was spinning through the "high desert of California in June". June is a hot time of the year and since it was in the hottest part of the desert, the hot increased. The terrain turning into "small rolling hills" did not help the cyclist. The hills would make driving more difficult. Anyone who rides a bike knows that it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat sidewalk. With the person running out of water, anyone would have a hard time continuing to ride. Most people didn't have these clues to keep moving forward. He did not set a specific goal, he simply went to the “next Horizon”. Shouldn't he just want to continue. Another problem with the physical environment was the condition of the roads. When the “ Rough Road Affect ” sign appeared, the journey became more difficult. A bicycle tire takes more effort to pass over uneven pavement, which is why the rider struggled so hard.                

<START>

 

In Joe Kurmaskie's “ Don't Go Over The Posted Speed Limit ” story, the setting hit the rider hard. With only a few sips of water left, he said ''… abandoned years earlier, at first glance this was a @ CAPS1 grape juice factory and a bottling plant. A shortbread photo of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth was still visible. I bowed my head. '' Having only a few drops of water and seeing that, my thirst would have increased again. Another way the setting affected the rider so hard was “The speed limit was 55mph. I was having a water exhaustion at 12mph. Sometimes I can feel so cruel.” It reminds him of that. he's not in a car, and he's not even going over half the speed. The setting affects the rider by reminding him of how long he has been driving, and now at this point he's in pain.      

<START>

 

In the test " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the adjustment of the bike affects it greatly. One evening, while resting, he entered into a deep conversation with some of the elders. Eventually, they started talking about his trip and the two men gave him a shortcut. "But that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town." When he arrives at the first town he finds it deserted, this affects the cyclist as he will eventually need more water. As he continues, he falls asleep on the road. " After stopping the first of them, a large road sign jumped at most : ROUGH ROAD AHEAD : DO NOT EXCEED THE DISPLAYED SPEED LIMIT " This sign indicated that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more difficult for cyclsit. So the frame is very important in this test because it has a lot to do with how the rider feels. When abandoned cities come to prayer, no desire to feel desperate. When the road gets bumpy, he gets tired. When he arrives in a real running store, he is relieved.                    

<START>

 

The characteristic of the frame affects the rider, as the characteristics are only a brief outline of what the text will talk about or who is involved in it. The rider gives you what you want and what you need to know, so the effect would be pretty much time the function is to finish the game in no one would like to see the rider.

In the story " Rough Road Ahead : Staying within the Posted Speed Limit " by Joe Kurmaskie, the frame characteristics affect the rider. The setting of a story is the background, place and time in which the story took place. In the story, a cyclist has to go to @ CAPS1 Park. He stops and is led by a group of old men who are not in tune with the times, and the cyclist gets lost. He faces drought, a snake and being lost in the desert the cyclist says, "At one point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake - it really looked like a diamond back - stuck. most of the sidewalk in front of me.

The rider chose the worst time to ride, it was an “early summer evening” in California. At this time the sun is hot and with little water and also lost it was hot the best choice he made. A cyclist before making a trip should be prepared for the conditions and also check a map of the location before going anywhere.

The cycle race in a diamond headed serpent , is out of the water and in the middle of nowhere the thing I would like to do is find some time to build a rope or an old cord or tree and hang myself to take directions from seniors who haven't left their porches since Carter was in power.          

<START>

 

The characteristics of this particular frame affected the rider in different ways. Arriving at the "ghost town" at the start of his trip, he felt slightly amused by the situation. But he soon became very confused when he noticed several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a dilapidated shed. The rider also felt a bit of irony as he approached the 55mph speed limit sign with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bike, at a speed of 12 mph, he could not even have reached the speed of 55 mph if he had wanted to. Before reaching what appeared to be an abandoned grape juice factory, the rider felt that twisted fun again as he laughed. The text reads: "It was a sad, desperate laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself." @ CAPS1, his suffering was over when he discovered a "fish camp" with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The rider's relief was so immense that he "had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners) (and) hug them.

The setting for this story takes place with a man riding a bicycle and then following the advice of elders for a faster route. The rider knew from the start that he should not have given his card. But thinking that the old people knew the way, he took their advice. What the rider should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and a lot more wrestling than needed. You should always think things through before you act, just to be on the safe side.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as he did not first know where he was going and was taking directions from people of whom he was not really sure. It was hot there was no water he had no idea where he was there were snakes. His water was flowing. there were no chants that he kept thinking he would never take an old guy's lead and stick with it in the future.

At first, when he receives instructions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town, he's tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he'll be in Yosemite soon. When he arrives at the water pump in the middle of the desert, he is tired and thirsty and he realizes that the indications given to him by the old men are outdated. He's really not happy to listen to them and not follow his card. When he arrives at the fishing spot he is thankful for the water in the sink and the rest and when the old man offers to give Yosemite instructions he thinks he will just use his card. Throughout history, cyclists need to go from feeling confident to feeling depressed in order to feel relived.

In the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit, the setting seemed to affect the main character (the cyclist) a lot during his pedaling, for example, all the dry desert made him think he could survive without water, he is became dehydrated. The first city, with @ NUM1 degree of water, could not meet its standards. The old June velches factory was completely dilapidated and no longer in operation, much like the desert, just an old land sterile and unused While yes the cyclist survived the pedal, the desert setting presented him with a great challenge.

Many characteristics of the frame affect the rider. One characteristic is that it gets hotter and hotter and this will affect it eventually. The phrase "I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage." shows that the heat might start to affect it. Another characteristic is that it is in the desert and that it lacks water. The line “ I touched my water bottles fairly regularly ” shows that he is drinking a lot of water and running out of water. Another feature is that it rides in the high deserts of California in June. The story says "and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June". Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because it is also in a desert. There is no doubt that he will become dehydrated. These are just some of the many characteristics that affect the rider.              

<START>

 

The setting affects the rider because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood for the test. I think the vibe of the trial is sort of a dry summer day, the "oh my god it's really hot" kind of thing. The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, weeds, and more to contribute to the feeling of hopelessness. Although he was safe and was not dead, it looked like he sure wouldn't be able to, judging by the lack of water, the scorching sun, and the distance, enduring these conditions. Thus, the frame affects the rider in a way that could have killed him.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because the old guys had brought the nearby town was only eighteen miles down the road. Thus, the characteristics affect the reading of the story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " was very dangerous and dangerous for people.

The frame affected the rider as it was bumpy and had a lot of hills meaning he has to work harder. Also because of the heat he got dehydrated in the story after the cyclist rode for a long time it is written “ I calmed myself down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state ” (kurmaskie @ NUM1). The cyclist had very little water for his long ride    

<START>

 

I think the way the frame features affect the rider is contempt. First of all, one reason would be that at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist ignores it going downhill anyway. Further, he says he "arrived in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face."

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as they have been through many ups and downs. At one point blackish water was flowing somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees… the weather was not cooling down.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because they make him need water. He was exhausted because the setting was so intense. “Within two miles of this next section of the trip, I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. This quote from the text shows that the cyclists' terrain was changing and they were affecting it.

The characteristics of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. Firstly, the sun constantly hitting the rider causes his body to sweat more, which causes his body to use more energy. The sun's rays also add to the heat felt by the rider. In addition, the bumpy road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which uses up even more energy. For example, when the " Do not exceed posted speed limit " rider hit bumpy roads, he had to pedal harder, causing him to sweat more and decrease his energy levels. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist desperate, which the cyclist felt in the test when he had no water or could not see any nearby town. This can affect the cyclist's willingness to continue pedaling, and if he has no determination the cyclist will not go anywhere. The characteristics of the frame can physically exhaust and mentally strain the rider, making it more difficult for him to continue

Snake, heat, ribs, this is what the rider had to face due to certain settings. He had to face a diamond back. It was going through the desert so it was like @ NUM1 degrees. While riding his bike he had to climb crippling hills. He had a redicuiou

The frame acts as a catylist in this story. This is the aspect of the story that always challenges the character to the very end. In the story it says "The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills". life can be so cool. It doesn't just show how bad the elements have him, it also shows how risky he is and how satirical life can be. of a boy "pouring a glass of refreshing juice into his mouth". No matter where the rider goes, he is always trying to overcome the elements.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example, the lack of water begins to impact how quickly he can get to the next city. Another example would be that the terrain only slows it down further.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider by causing him to consume the rest of his water because it is hot, and there is no one around because he is in the deserts of California. “I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage…” (@ NUM1.). This test effort supports my previous statement about heat, as the speaker tells us how he sweats and that he might see a mirage. “There was not a single glimpse, not a building, car or any other structure of any kind” (@ NUM2.). It shows that there is no one to help him if he falls from heatstroke or something like that. The setting therefore affects the endurance of cyclists.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider making it more difficult to ride. “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills. " " I could get a heat stroke on a beautiful day in June. " "a large road sign jumped out of the atm." "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit." "Sometimes life can seem so cruel." The fact that it was so hot made the trip longer. When you are out of the water, you feel exostated. You will do just about anything to try and resist the heat.

Author Joe Kurmaskie learns about the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in "Stay within the posted speed limit." As a cyclist circulating in one of California's less developed regions, the lack of water found in this setting proves to be crippling for his survival. The paths he was directed to had no cities or sources of fresh, clean drinking water for days. The combination of constant exercise on horseback in the field, lack of water and resources, Californian summer weather and lack of civilization dragged the author's energy down and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposure to these conditions could have killed him. The modern period and year also ensured that the instructions given to the author were precise and as a result the cyclist found himself in such a dangerous part of the country. The setting of “do not exceed the posted speed limit” places the rider in a life-threatening situation.

The characteristics of an environment can be different. It can snow and be cold, rain and of course wet, hot and dry, windy and humid. Features can be rough or lonely country road, there can be rough terrain or straight away. The establishment of a place puts pressure on the reality of what will happen to a cyclist. In the essay, a young cyclist takes advice from an elderly man and ends up driving through the scorching sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat made him feel like death was coming upon him and the thirst made him more determined to travel to the next town so that he could survive. If the frame specs had been different, let's say it was riding a flat road in a busy city with a breeze and places to stop for water wherever it wouldn't have feared for its life. The characteristics of the frame affect the way the rider feels and thinks. He may feel angry, happy, sad, or scared, and he may start to think about his own death. This is what I believe some of the effects settings have on the rider.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example, when the author says that " flat roads have been replaced by short rolling hills ", this forced the author to drive more safely. Plus, when he says "the ridiculously tall snake blocked most of the sidewalk." The author had to slow down on his bicycle and find a safe way around it in order to overtake it. Finally, when the author says "no one in sight", neither building, nor car, nor structure ", he is affected because he cannot ask questions since he is lost and thirsty. The setting makes it difficult for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider because the person who rode the bike was very tired, their legs and body needed rest after riding their bike for @ NUM1 miles in the pedal. It affected the rider as well because of all the races he had to go through to fight to get to where he was trying to get to, but he was a strong man and he was ready to finish his forty miles of pedaling. He was also restless but he did.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider in “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit ”, as he is going over many different terrains. The cyclist begins in a town and heads for Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old people. He started off strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He continued to go to another abandoned city. He decided to continue until he saw a sign. The terrain was very different with rolling hills and tumbleweed and a snake. Listening to the old men, the cyclist almost died of the threatening heat and lack of water. The scenery affected the rider even more seriously than he could have imagined.           

<START>

 

In the story, the decor greatly influences the attitude of the cyclist. When he begins, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he discusses with the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and thinks about Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident, however, his attitude about the day changes dramatically when he meets the old run down shed, rusty pumps and a corral in the park. on the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he stumbles upon the abandoned factory, he is certainly very discouraged. A little later, he stumbles upon @ PERSON1's Fish camp, he is very relieved and grateful to the owners. The attitude of the cyclist changed depending on whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not.

The characteristics of the frame have a great effect on the desperate journeys of the tired cyclist. The sometimes disappointing, sometimes exhilarating landscapes that he traverses affect him physically and emotionally when he passes in front of a portrin the road with nothing but a "dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a corral ...", he becomes disturbed . The rider runs out of water when he becomes even more distraught on a road with a posted speed limit of 55 mph, while “doing a water removal @ NUM1”. The hot June sunset affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an 'ironic twist', the rider is emotionally affected as he walks past an abandoned @ ORGANIZATION1 factory. The factory features an image of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth, which upsets the thirsty cyclist.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider more than anything in reading "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit". In the beginning when riders were just starting his bike as he uses a positive tone to describe the frame. For example, in paragraph four he says that "the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written on them." “When he says that, the reader imagines someone in a ??? more excited than ??? ??? ??? ??? its destination in dry weather. As the attitude of the cyclists decreases, the reader makes the connection, what ?? ?? then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen, when the cyclist says, " I wiped the curse from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage and that in order not to get too excited, " the reader can relate that it becomes serious enough for the cyclist to continue as if. Overall, as the setting goes to the extremely hot 'scorching sun', with a lack of water, the rider becomes more sarcastic and less heated. For example, when he talks about pebbles in his mouth, he says " with only luck I would have hit a lump and lodged one in my throat ." This shows a bad mood affected by the characteristics of the frame.

The rougher the road for him, the more determination he has at the beginning towards the end, he had the idea that, "it didn't matter, it was going to die", it cost him dearly and it was difficult to go to. He realized he didn't want to die this way and so he carried on, ultimately leading to civilization.

The characteristic of the frame affects the rider a lot as the rough terrain is described implying that the rider probably struggled halfway through the story, he said: "The flat road has been replaced by rolling hills. . " He said this to describe the difficulty of this race. It also makes it feel like it's exciting because it changes things. It wouldn't be exciting if they said flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didn't show the change in terrain at all.

Difficult road to navigate : do not exceed the posted speed limit. " An essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, speaks of a solo cyclist traveling to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a bunch of old people and finds himself lost on a bumpy road with no water, where the reliable supply of flat roads has been replaced by short hills and big highways have jumped over me. It was written : ROUGH ROAD AHEAD : DO NOT EXCEED THE DISPLAYED SPEED LIMIT. " The bumpy road forced to work harder, to want more water and make things more difficult than they already were.

The settings of your surroundings always seem to affect your mood. Take for example the cycler. At first he had a positive attitude, but once he got to the first town his attitude started to wane. He explains that he describes the city as perhaps at one point a prosperous place, "but that morning it met the traditional definition of a ghost town." Ghost towns are very old, run down, and drab. This affected the rider because by not being like the old folks said he was getting skeptical which in turn doesn't give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when it comes to what is supposed to be water and a "tar like substance has seeped out." It never drives him crazy because he's not sure he'll be okay with it. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store. The framework becomes positive and so does he. Thus, the frame affects the mood and attitude of cyclists.

Many adjustment functions affect the rider. One of the characteristics of the dessert like, which is the setting, is the dry air and hot temperatures. This heat forced the cyclist to continue, with despair the author said, "I was going to die and the bird world is cleaning me up." @ CAPS1 characteristic of the frame was the deserted towns which did not contain water. This lack of water made it horrible for him to continue. The thirst was so strong that he had to put stones in his mouth to suck on stones helps quench your thirst by letting your remaining saliva circulate. @ CAPS1 frame characteristics that affected the rider was the abandoned Welch's Grape factory. This factory gave the cyclist false hopes as it would have been so good to have grape juice while he was thirsty. The narrator called the factory. Ironic twist. "

The effect of the setting that affected me is that by riding the bike in hot weather with only a little water to drink as I would have given up having nothing to drink. The water must have been hot.

Many characteristics of the frame affect the rider. For example, in the story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the lack of water in the dry desert had a lasting effect on the cyclist. "Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt, and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day just because I was listening to gentlemen who hadn't come out of their porch. for decades, made me laugh. " This shows the reader how all the heat and lack of water made the rider very hot and dehydrated and she could pass out at any time. She also thinks beyond that by making fun of herself and trying to conserve as much energy as possible. As a result, the effect of the frame on the rider is that the lack of water gave him the humor and courage to keep going, to get to his final destination.

At the beginning the cyclist feels good, he gets discouraged a bit, but basically he is doing well. “ The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them ” (@ CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pines. They give him a feeling of comfort. He thinks that after the first "tree" isn't much, the others will be better. He knows he has the courage to do it, but he does not yet know that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, “ It says : ROUGH ROAD AHEAD : DO NOT EXCEED THE DISPLAYED SPEED LIMIT ”. he knows things are going to get tough because “the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a 12 mph draining water ”. At this point, he starts to worry, because he is no longer alone there, and he realizes that he has no water. As there is a lack of water, the landscape and its surroundings begin to become more and more dry. He says, “ The weeds have crossed my path. " The landscape also seems to become more threatening," a ridiculously great shock. " The landscape changes with the state of the water.

"Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" Joe Kurmaskie tells how a cyclist takes older men directions that do not properly tell him the way to get to Yosemite, so that the rider is found lost with almost no water. Frame characteristics such as terrain and sun affect the rider in the story. The sun was very hot on a summer day and without water it was even difficult to keep moving as it was very hot and thirsty. @ PERSON2, "The sun was starting to hit ... I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June" (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and difficult to navigate.

The features of the decor taunt the cyclist with cruel irony. As the cyclist continues on his way, he passes through a ghost town, then twenty miles down the road, he sees a dilapidated shed and rusty water pumps. He tries to squeeze out some water because it's lacking, but all he can get is mud, and then what he describes as "the water smelling two hundred degrees, she had the taste of battery acid ". Further down the road there was a sign saying the road was rough, obey the posted speed limit of 55, it was going 12 mph. Worse yet, he found an abandoned juice factory on the way, by then he was out of water.

The characteristics affected the rider in several ways, one being the road sign “ ROUGH ROAD AHEAD : DO NOT EXCEED DISPLAYED SPEED LIMIT ”. The terrain was now short and hilly which would make it more difficult for the rider to pedal in the hills as it would take a lot more effort and energy. Also, there were roadblocks, "at one point tumbleweeds blocked my way and a ridiculously large snake" These roadblocks would put the rider in danger, as he would have to bypass them, wasting time and effort. energy, which would make him drink more water.

After reading "Don't Go Over Posted Limit", I saw how the scene of an area can affect your mood and attitude towards things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who follows the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who point him to a bad shortcut. As he rolls, he meets some hills. These hills have really affected him physically, he gets tired of continuously going up and down. " That mood " has been replaced by short, shifting hills. " The rider could not try anything, without showing how long it should continue to go up and down. There at one point he said, "@ CAPS1 can feel so cruel." There he is upset because a road sign popped up on acidic and hard roads telling him not to exceed 55 miles per hour while driving at 12 miles per hour. It can also be seen as metaphorical. When you take a shortcut in life, there are always consciences when you decide to drop out of high school, how is it with your journal, where is always the possibility of not working, and where you cry without a diploma ?? and he finds a job

In the news, "Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the setting affects the rider in the story. For example, the hot, dry air begins to dehydrate him slowly, causing the cyclist to lose all sense of reason, the heat has also played tricks on him. In addition, the rolling hills exhausted him to work to climb them. This, also along with the heat factor, caused him to use his much needed water supply.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. The area he was in had a major effect. He was in California. which is a great dessert. In the middle of some it is very hot.

The features of the scenery affected the rider as it was a hot June day in a California desert. For example, you are in the desert on a bicycle for many hours very hot and have little water. This affects the author because it is necessary to conserve water in order to be able to get to the park. Another example is that you are going up and down hills and your legs are very tired and don't want to move. And the best example is the sun hits you and you sweat so much and @ MONTH1 sees something but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that have affected the rider a lot.

The cyclist in the story encounters a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California on a bicycle. After a few minutes you will be thirsty. The cyclist brought water, but after constant sweating, the water supply is almost exhausted. Not having enough water can cause a person to become dehydrated, which can cause them to pass out and eventually die. As you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting of the story. He was adversely affected by the heat and the lack of water.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example, the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place. Which meant there was no water to see for miles. In addition, the cities were nowhere to be found as it would be difficult to sustain life there. This quote argues that there weren't many cities, “About forty miles in the pedal, I got to the first city. “It shows that there aren't many cities in these areas, @ CAPS1 so hot and thirsty as the text claims,“ I once read that sucking stones helps forget about thirst ” this clearly shows that the man was very thirsty. Also shows that the man was very thirsty. Also @ CAPS1 so hot there man could have visions as the text says, 'As it often looks like it was a grape juice factory and a bottling factory . why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of nowhere. Therefore, these statements above show how the settings can affect the mind and physical condition of the rider.

The parameter that affects the rider is the road condition as the road turns in all directions and the road goes up a hill, so it is more difficult to climb the route the rider has at NUM1 miles before arriving in a town where he could run out of the water. If he runs out of water before he gets there, he may have to stop so as not to get sick. When he gets to town he may have more water.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider making them hot and thirsty most of the time. As he rode he slowly started to tire and he got work and more thirst. He drank his water without thinking too much about it at first, but as he continued he slowly found himself trying to conserve it. By the time he got to the Second Wild City, he was so thirsty and tired that he thought it might be a "death" so he wiped the sweat from his eyes. "To make sure it didn't. was not a mirage. The moment people see mirages is when they are hot, tired and about to kill for water.

This is said at the end of the @ NUM1 paragraph : “ and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. " The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry and warm. Not something anyone should be riding a bike on, if the scenery spoke of the mountainous parts of California, the withers would be hot or tired because the mountains are a cool, albeit dry place. If I had cycled, I would have preferred to cycle in a different setting, like mountains, than in a barren desert. that way I wouldn't have to endure the discomfort of a cyclist.

The characteristics defined in the story “ Do not exceed the posted speed limit ” are very important for the cyclist. In this story, the setting affected the rider a lot as it was in California which is a very hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems due to the weather and the lack of water. As he lacked water, he had to save it which slowed him down as he could not ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a Yosemite river, he must have passed quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the rider and how much he could ride.

In Joe Kurmaskie's story "Do not exceed posted speed limit", the feature of the setting affects the rider in several ways. In the story he goes that the man goes twenty miles here and sixty miles there and it's very hot outside and he only has so much water that he doesn't think he will get to where it needed to go because it's not that it needs more water. As the airlock narrator "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June," which is absolutely not California in June. The hot desert weather has made it limited to a water supply, and the fact that it is in the middle of nowhere with no building around makes it lose all hope of making it. There were snakes in the desert putting him in danger, and the bumpy road made it impossible for him to hang on and get anywhere. "I started to divide the ride into the distance I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could please it, I would be fine." This quote shows his fight because of the region he was in but also because of his perseverance. The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in this test.       

<START>

 

There are many characteristics of the rider's environment that affect their speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motorcycles or even buildings. It is as if he is in the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won't touch anything. Being alone in large, open spaces increases his energy level and makes him more confident.

To be able to have a good bike ride, you need a good frame. For me a good setting would be around @ NUM1 ° outside and sunny. You cannot ride a bike in the snow because the tires cannot move in the snow. You cannot go there in the rain or hail as the roads become slippery and you might have an accident which could injure or kill you. If the weather is nice outside, you can ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze in your hair and you can get refreshed. That's why I think it's important that the frame is perfect for a bike ride.

this story takes place in the heat of the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a national park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is, the more water is needed to hydrate, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote “About forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first“ town. ” The place could have been a prosperous little syo like it once was.” This quote shows how deserted is and how, while he rolls around, there is no one around nowhere to rehydrate, nowhere to go, he was alone.

In Joe Kurmaskie's " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " test, the frame greatly affected the rider. In this story, the cyclist heads for Yosemite National Park, thinking wise, he accepts instructions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey with confidence on level ground and with a large reserve of water. The first of the three promised cities had resigned themselves to that of a ghost town. The second only offered water that looked slightly like battery acid. The cyclist is quickly exhausted by the lack of water and must cross the now hilly terrain. He barely arrives in the third city to realize that the juice factory was bankrupt. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he comes across a bait shop. If it hadn't been so hot, if the “towns” along the route had offered better resources and if the terrain hadn't been so hilly, the rider would have had a very pleasant ride. All of the above mentioned factors of the frame greatly affected the rider.           

<START>

 

Hot, terrain, the middle of nowhere, all are characteristics of the setting that have affected the rider. First, the hot weather in California made the rider thirsty and almost dehydrated. There was no place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad and hot. Second, the different types of terrain also made the rider very thirsty and tired. Finally, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere. He couldn't have water to hydrate or to sit and rest.     

<START>

 

The setting for the cyclist is difficult and dangerous. He had little water and his region had difficult terrain. “ I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ” (@ NUM1). He's dehydrated and still has a long way to go. I did a several mile bike ride to @ LOCATION2, and we had no water because we couldn't take a break. The ground was hard, as was that of the author. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to be done with it. I'm just glad I don't have to cycle on this terrain.             

<START>

 

The “ Do not exceed posted speed @ CAPS1 ” rider was riding through the California dessert in June. This dry and bare setting made it impossible to find a source of water. The only time this rider has found water is when he @ NUM1 and tastes battery acid. There was nowhere to find water for miles. This lack of water and the scorching heat made him travel slowly and wearily. He even says he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone. Following the advice of the old and taking a "shortcut", the cyclist passes through ghost towns without water. This "shortcut" prolonged its journey, most likely by several hours. If he had walked through a populated area despite it being a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would have allowed him to go faster. The dry and warm frame of the old 'short cut' made this cyclist's trip much longer than nessiarry.          

<START>

 

When the man started riding his bike he thought it would be an easy ride. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1, he says " Things have started off pretty well." I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. As he moved forward he realized he was in the middle of nowhere. The landscape became more and more empty. There was ultimately nothing. The landscape thwarted his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example : in paragraph @ NUM2, it is stated : “ a large road sign came out of me. It said : Rough Road Ahead : don't exceed the posted speed limit. " He realized that this was going to be difficult. He had to travel on bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bitten. The landscape created a feeling of hopelessness because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop his morale improved and he was now hopeful and relieved.                      

<START>

 

When the cyclist started his journey, he was confident he would succeed. Throughout history however, the cyclist endures many conflicts over his successes in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difficulty once he reached a small abandoned town. “ I knocked my water bottles quite regularly and traveled to the high deserts of California in June ” (kurmaskie @ NUM1). The cyclist realized that he had not kept his water and that his “ water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips ” (kurmaskie @ NUM1). In addition to his water problem, the heat was incredible. He was losing his hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist also took care of difficult roads. There was a lot this rider endured throughout his journey, but he was determined to complete his journey and was filled with satisfaction once he got over those hardships.            

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame have an effect on the rider. The first thing would be to listen to old men who seemed to have no idea of the distance, length or condition of the roads they were sending him to. Another thing that affected him was the condition of the road, where there were tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake. The second thing that would come into play would be the hot weather that played out dehydration.   

<START>

 

A main feature of the setting that affects the rider is the heat of the day. If you are cycling in the heat of the day, you will be consuming a lot of water. Another factor is the limited water supply. The last factor is the bad leadership of older men. Older people are not always wrong but their information. May be obsolete.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the test frame affect the rider as while cycling through California he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad state of dehydration while cycling, looking for water or something drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a while, the cyclist finds himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist struggles and battles with dehydration is "wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day just because What I listened to from the gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch for decades showed how the settings in this test greatly affected the rider.

While the writers travel to Yosemite, he does not have the proper tools to navigate the long expanse of desert he had to face, and by tools I mean water. The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation. The author described how the lack of water affected him. He described it with phrases like " Rattled around the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain." " The author is clearly not face the brutal heat with its huge lack of water. The author was getting a neat hit while going through the desert snakes and tumbleweeds @ LOCATION2 . The author was clearly fighting the desert heat @ LOCATION2.

Settings and features are very important for riders as water and food can take a water bottle and a snack, but they need to know where they are going and whether they need to supplement or not. In the story I just read he didn't bring enough to last so he got instructions but they were bad so he was in trouble. It is important for a cyclist to know where he is going and what is around him so that he does not get lost and does not have access to food or water.

The characteristics of the setting affected the rider as it was in a desert in June which was really hot and dry, there were also no trees around so there was no shade to stand by. relax, so the sun was hitting her back as well. There were also a lot of hills which took its strength to jump, for example it is written "on a long crippling hill". There was also a big crazy twist in its path. He even saw a snake. All of these things made him really tired, for example he didn't have much water and the sun made him hot and dehydrated. There was no shade so he just had to catch the sun beating on his back. He had to jump over hills, which took a lot of energy. He had to go up a long hill, which also tired him out. All of these things happened one after the other without giving him a break, so it really got him tired.        

<START>

 

In the story, he explained the beauty of the night, as well as the outdoors and how it affects his travel. The characteristics of the frame affect the rider, as the frame was soft, sounded warm and calm. He also showed us how it contains. The frame was similar to that of the cyclist. This is how the characteristics of the setting affect the rider.    

<START>

 

The rider was in California in June with the sun beating down on him making the ride difficult with an insufficient water supply. The man came across several abandoned towns, which reduced his water supply. The terrain was long and straight and then turned into high hills which must have been difficult to climb. 

<START>

 

How the characteristics of the frame affect the cyclist is the condition of the roads, hills and the ?? Heat. The road conditions in the settings affect the rider because the roads are rough. A firm example of the text is "I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short hills. These conditions make it difficult for the cyclist it gives him a challenge. The rolling hills challenge it, a regret staying on the road, it's easily tricky and so were the challenges. The heat and the sun also played a loving role on the rider. An example of @ CAPS1 is. I laughed, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was starting to heat up but I barely didn't ???. the sun was not starting to have it ?? strongly ?? It will start to do ????? when is ?? is high deserts. I conclude that these frame characteristics have affected the rider in a number of ways, but he continues to push himself to do more.

The cyclist had some effects on his route. One of them was that he was going up hills, that was a problem as it used up most of his energy and slowed him down. The other was water, the lack of water. If the water had had energy, he would have received a boost that would have kept him alive.

In the test " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the characteristics of the frame affect the rider. First, the cyclist had cycled through the "high deserts of California" suggesting that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he must have been regularly thirsty and exhausted by the sun beating down on him. Second, it started to go through some hills, and as common sense would be used, the hills are much harder to cycle, especially uphill, and it tires you out. These hills, as well as a lack of water must have tired him and made it extremely difficult to get by without much water. As you can see, the difference in tuning plays a crucial role on the rider and his precious water supply.        

<START>

 

The setting affects cyclists as it cannot withstand the heat. His water supply is working as it should and he is dehydrated. That said when the characters say so. “The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. Large wings of sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that I could suddenly fall to the head. ”This means he's afraid of passing out and dying before he finds more water.    

<START>

 

The frame affected the rider in several ways. The first place he arrived was a "ghost town". Then he hit a water pump about twenty miles up the road. The water was very hot and tasted very bad. The text reads: "… feet in water somewhere around two hundred degrees… when I tried a drop or two it tasted like battery acid." Then he had to travel without water and became dehydrated. As he walked through the hills, he thought he was starting to imagine a building that could eventually provide him with water. The building was there but it was abandoned. He decided he was going to do it on some pebbles. The text reads: "I once read that sucking stones helps to relax ..."        

<START>

 

It is hot so the rider is very dehydrated, tired and lacking water. “ I checked my water supply and heated ” is a good example. There are also a lot of sad and deserted places without cars around these bars where cyclists hope to find civilization. Also, not seeing any building and when it sees that it is deserted makes it very difficult for the runner. Another event that wreaks havoc on him is when he @ CAPS1 the pump which has tar, dirt, and then hot water. Also the road plays a toll on him. I know this house, he says "If I could just get to the next horizon / next hill, I'll be fine". This is how I know the frame and the characteristics of the frame affect riders mentally and physically.

Hot, alone, no water - all are reasons why the characteristics of the frame affect the rider. It is very hot while the cyclist is riding. This makes the cyclist worried about becoming dehydrated. The cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight. If anything happened to him, there was no one to help him. The rider had very little water and had to conserve it in order to stay active and have energy. With very little water, it's hard to stay hydrated. Hot, alone, no water - all are reasons why the characteristics of the frame affect the rider.

The terrain a cyclist rides on has a big impact on them. The first example is that they are driving on hills, which makes it much more difficult for them. For example, when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to go up hills, he was sadly disappointed. Another thing that affects cyclists is the smoothness of the road they ride. In the story "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the main character fell on a difficult road and was disappointed and did not want to ride it. Another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat. Several times in the story the cyclist says he is tired and dehydrated, at one point he thinks he is going to die of heat stroke. These are the effects of the jumper setting on him.

The “Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit” test framework has a major effect on the rider. The scenery is the high deserts of California where it is June and very hot. The cyclist's path suggested by some old people makes the heat even worse because there is no one or water in sight. In the trial, the rider starts the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @ NUM1 miles he arrives in a "ghost town" the old men have led him to believe it would be a sedentary town where he could get more supplies and cool off. As soon as the temperature rises to what appears to be "two hundred degrees" the rider begins to run out of water and feels "sometimes life can seem so cruel". and make him feel like he's saying "I was going to die". stopped. The author, @ PERSON1 uses the framework of the essay to help get their point across that blindly trusting people instead of trusting yourself, things might end up being hard for you to overcome.

In the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" the rider sees many different settings when he left, it was early summer and it was quite hot outside. He rode until morning when it tired him. The first town he encountered was a ghost town, meaning he could rest for supplies. Then it comes through cool pine trees and a tumultuous river, which probably makes it feel relaxed. Then he showed up in a dilapidated hangar with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldn't hold any product. Closed men whose people made him feel unresponsive, and the pumps weren't giving him water, so no one was pointing him too. Then he drove through the Californian deserts in June, which probably made him even more pissed off.

The rider should never have taken the advice of the older men. The card would have been much safer and easier. People always seem to be looking for a shortcut, including me. He could have died from heatstroke and lack of water. He had perseverance even though he never gave up and that's what saved him. Being in this situation and in this framework, I would have given up.

When you cycle, it is important to be aware of the type of terrain in question, to ensure the weather, to ensure the environment and above all to ensure your resources. These items are essential before taking a cycling trip. They are very important in determining what type of trip you will be taking and a pleasant and relaxing trip, or a long and miserable trip.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider when traveling very far where he is going. For example, "About forty miles in the pedal, I came to the first town." good that he took water or who knows if he would have survived or not. I think the biggest mistake was probably asking someone who had never been on the road for directions. When he asked the person he found himself standing in front of a sign that said Rough road Ahead: Don't pass, that's when I felt sorry for him, and that's probably the hallmark effective that happened to him.

In the story "Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speed" by @ PERSON1, the settings in the story affect the rider in several ways. The first and most obvious is the temperature, it is hot so the rider gets hot and becomes dehydrated making him thirsty. A second way the tuning affects the rider is the fact that there is nothing around them. Since there is nothing around him, there is nowhere to find water, which worsens the effect of dehydration and makes him more thirsty. The biker said, “A shackle shed ran, several rusty pumps and the corral that couldn't contain the lamestmal greeted me. This author's statement supports the fact that there is nothing around. Another feature of the setting that affected the rider were the hills. Hills tire the rider, requiring more pedaling and wear and tear, the setting characteristics had a big effect on the rider, from heat and dehydration to hills and energy. One thing the tuning didn't have was a positive effect on the rider.

In the story " Do not exceed posted speed limit " by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the rider. It was a hot June day and his water supplies were running out. He took the wrong direction in these old people, so he would have to ride the bike longer than he should and he would need water to pedal all this way for nothing. As he was going in the wrong direction, there was no building for him to have water, there was no one there, so he could not communicate and there would be no one to call for help. help in case it gets too hot from the heat.       

<START>

 

In the story, the rider has faced several melancholy sites. For example, the "ghost town" he encountered at the start really weighed on him because he had no one to ask for other directions or a place to cool off. Further down the road, the hill he climbed was a physical obstacle he had to overcome. With the sun beating down on his back and the emptiness of the road, he might have started wanting to turn back. He continued to persevere, this is how he managed to do it. The lack of water also made it difficult for him. Traveling with his short water and starting to feel sick didn't go well with him.      

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in a negative way. For example, a tar-like substance oozed out followed by a sensation of brackish water somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. says the terrain is bad, which means the rider has to pedal harder to keep going, and has to work harder to feel the heat. All of this affects him from what surrounds him. The old quit factory with the boy drinking juice had the biggest effect on the rider because he was so thirsty and that was when he was about to quit .

In the story " Do not exceed posted speed limit ", the setting affects the rider in several ways. The speaker tells us that he is cycling in the middle of the desert in June. This shows that the author is probably very sexy. The author tells us that the road turned into hills and bumps. This would make the task harder for the author as he would have to use more energy to climb the hill. And finally, the cyclist tells us that the "towns" where he came were abandoned and poorly maintained. This would not be good for the cyclist as he could get water for his ride.

The @ CAPS1 is affected in several ways. The main thing that affects it is the lack of water. Throughout the story he mentions the lack of water. He also keeps telling himself that he shouldn't have taken this path. For example, " I could have heatstroke on a beautiful June day because I listened to gentlemen who hadn't been out of their porch for decades, made me laugh.

The setting affects the rider a lot and now he feels. If he was in a bad setting, he would probably be in a bad mood. Mood is strongly affected by the general setting. In the test "Bumpy road: do not exceed the posted speed limit", the rider feels very confident in himself and the frame contributes to reinforce this confidence and this andorance.

The characteristics of the essay setting greatly affected the author. The hills, on a hot day with no water, or the nearby town are really tough, especially if you have walked more than @ NUM1 miles. The hot June weather environment near a dessert area can cause serious problems like heatstroke and since he had no water to drink, dehydration caused a lot of fear in the boy. 'author.

In the short story, "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit", the setting greatly affects the rider. For example. Early in the story, the cyclist can't wait to get to Yosemite National Park. He listened to the advice of elders who have not left the confines of their parches since Carter came to power, "and quickly realized he shouldn't have." The author describes the framework of the first "city" as "the traditional definition of a ghost town". It didn't bother the rider as much as his next sight. "A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the larger mule." That's what met him there. The cyclist said "this sight was disturbing". It is obvious that the rider has lost hope when he says: “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean. This short story shows how anything can worry even the best travelers for their survival.           

<START>

 

 I think the characteristics of the settings affect the cyclist because the knowledge of the cyclist is limited eg, " the elders who have not left the confines of their porches since Carter was in power " which means he is now time for the elderly to relax and watch the younger ones.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because where he rides it is very dry and hot. He can cope with the heat with his good supply of water, but when he runs out he starts to get disoriented. For example, in the text he writes “on a long crippling hill a building appeared. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage. believe he imagined seeing a building. Another example is “ A shortbread image of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I bow my head. This quote shows that the rider is completely desperate when he looks at the photo and lowers his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly reminded of how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he went and that he couldn't drink. This is how the characteristics of the frame affected the rider.

The framework of "Rough Road Ahead: Staying within the posted speed limit" has greatly affected the rider in history. “ Not two miles into that next driving reaction I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills ”(kurmaskie). cyclist traverses hot, dry California in mid-June without much water. The fact that he now has to go up and down short hills will make him even more tired, as going over hills takes more energy than going flat. This loss of energy coupled with the cyclist's lack of water makes him even more miserable. The setting of this story greatly affected the cyclist.       

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the mood and behavior of the rider. First, the cyclist sees believing that the shortcut will help him get to Yosemite faster, so he thinks it won't. Then the harsh sun, rough terrain, and lack of water cause the cyclist to give up hope of getting to yosemite and cause them to rethink their judgment and follow the advice of others.  

<START>

 

The frame hit the rider hard. At first the rider was fine and going strong, but shortly after the first "ghost town" he was getting weak. Then the cyclist had to face some problems. For example, there was a lack of water. In addition, he faced bumpy roads. Finally, he faced the snakes and abandonment. The cyclist had to face many obstacles, but in the end he got away strong. 

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider for these reasons. He says "A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that couldn't fit in the most lame mule greeted me. The sight was disturbing. It shows how the features affected the rider because he says the sight was disturbing. It confused him because he wanted water and he saw the rusty pumps that reminded him of water but he knew there was no water or that it was was mean

Environmental conditions as well as the road can have a major effect on the cyclist. For example, if someone was riding a bike in hot weather on level ground, it wouldn't take a lot of determination to pedal. On the other hand, if it is hot and rough on hilly paths, the rider will become dehydrated and it takes a lot more effort to go up and over the hill. These five environmental conditions greatly affect a cyclist.   

<START>

 

In the test "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the cyclist, en route to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the harsh deserts of California. As is normal in all deserts, the sun is scorching hot, as is the sand. There is no water anywhere, and dangerous and highly poisonous creatures are plentiful. The lack of water almost puts him in heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike on his own. A juice factory gropes him, laughs at him, but he continues, at a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and its lousy 12mph speed gets it virtually nowhere. Until he finally reaches a modern space and drinks at the bathroom sink.      

<START>

 

In the story, the frame plays a big role in the effect of the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times with such big hills and windy tears. Besides, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people that brought him down alone and his life was going to die. The author describes the land in part of the story “On a crippling hill, a building appeared! This quote shows how very large and difficult the scenery hills were to overcome. It also shows the importance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story, the author has described many features of the frame which all greatly affected the rider.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider, putting it in unwanted places starting with this man took advice from many older men, who don't even know the area anymore. So crossing this man seems lost, he tries to follow their advice, but encounters many unknown and unwanted areas. He starts off well, then comes to a " rough road " and he even says that " sometimes life can seem so cruel ". Then he got to this big snake in the middle of the spooky road, he has to slowly walk past this thing that takes up most of the road. To come to terms with these things was very strong and hard on the part of this young man.

The dessert environment had a huge impact on the rider. He drank his water regularly and was going to run out of it. Not realizing that there would be no refills because the pump was only giving "a tar-like substance," the text said. With the lack of water, dehydration began to hit the poor man. One effect of dehydration is a bad balance that would have been helpful in getting past the "ridiculously big snake" he had seen. A final effect would be mirages which could lose your judgment. This man rechecked his eyes, when he saw a building, "[wiping] sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it was not a mirage." the shortcut and survive the heat, dehydration and dessert animals.

I think the setting characteristics of the story "Don't exceed the speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, strongly affect the rider. Some suggest that it is very hot outside and that city dwellers do not have it. helped I know it's not because the text says “somewhere in the vicinity of @ NUM1 degrees.” It implies that it's very hot outside. I can tell people in cities don't have it helped because the text says, "Never accept travel advice from a collection of elders who have not left the confines of their front porch since Carter was in office. "It shows that the townspeople did not help him. Some information expressed in this text would be that there is a rough road and he was rocked. I know this is expressed because it tells you directly in the text “ Rough road ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit. ” It comes out right away and tells you that there is a rough road. You know there is a tremor because the text says, "and a ridiculously big snake blocked the majority of the road. I think there is a lot of information implied t expressed in the story" do not go beyond not the speed limit.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider more broadly, almost leading to a very serious situation. The cyclist was in a desert. Like terria, which was unpopulated on its trail, there was a lack of freshwater supply and the temperatures are more extreme. The cyclist could easily pass out from heat stroke, from lack of water and excessive heat and from the work he was doing while swirling. If the area had been more populated, he would have had a better chance of getting water, greatly reducing his risk of heat stroke. There were also the snakes which presented a danger to him, if he bit then he would be at least @ NUM1 miles away from help from the closet which could prove to be fetal. If the setting had been, say a city park, on a populated countryside, this setting would have provided exponential risk of loss and danger to the cyclist.

The conditions and characteristics of the frame made the rider tired and dehydrated and thought he was going to die. For example, it is written " and the growing awareness that I might fall from heatstroke someday from Georges in June ". Plus, he thinks he's getting dehydrated when he says, “ I was exhausting the water at 20 km / h. sometimes life could be so cruel ”. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water, which made him think he was going to die of heat stroke or dehydration.

The setting affects the rider as he is in the middle of nowhere without water. The cyclist had to cycle more than @ NUM1 miles to try to get to Yosemite. “ I knocked my water bottles quite regularly. " This quote shows that he is just beginning to run out of water. "The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips." This quote shows that he really had nothing to drink at all. Not having water in the high deserts of California while cycling for more than @ NUM1 miles is not a good @ CAPS1 unless you have a car.

In the test, the frame had everything to do with the cyclist as he crosses the desert with batey tay water. It pedals in the dry heat which is harsh even though you have water and there were deadly snakes in the hills. It's dangerous enough without that stuff being there. So I listened to the cyclist and never listened to the old people.

On cyclists going to Yosemite National Park, he has a lot of difficulty due to the environment and advice given by the elderly. The cyclist biking in mid-June in the deserts of California is not good to start adding to the cyclist's dehydration state. He first encountered "a dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that could not contain the wailing mule." him. He described the terrain as "short rolling hills" and "on a long crippling hill". It shows some of the obstacles he had to overcome on his bike, just to get to Yosemite National Park. He @ CAPS1 realized once he encountered these characteristics of the terrain that he was not on the right track and needed help. After his environment survives For as long as he could, @ CAPS1 receives help in a real camp. This is how the backdrops of history play a role in the cycling epidemic.

"Staying within the posted speed limit" is an inspiring and almost humorous essay that takes the reader on a journey through a daily cyxlist routine. In this story, the author fights dehydration as he tries to get to a national park with shortened instructions from the "elders" the setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist and the pity the reader feels for him. Halfway through the test, the rider had already ridden about @ NUM1 miles; it is extremely crazy. The fact that he travels through the California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states that he is in a ghost town, two sentences after saying the sun is beating hard. At the time, he wasn't really bothered. Another description of his surroundings that likely affected his ability to peddle was when he said that "the flat road has been replaced by short hills". He was already dehydrated and had traveled so far before, the rocky roads probably didn't help his trip much. The setting essentially made history. If he hadn't been peddling in the wilderness, this would have been just another trip in his life. The frame allows the reader to see what the rider is really going through.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. He does this because the road is not in good condition and he has to travel a long distance with bad weather. This affects him because he could become dehydrated. In conclusion, there are a lot of things in the frame that have affected the rider.

The tuning was the main effect on the rider. He said it was hot and he was lost. The cyclist did not know where he was going and it was hot outside. He seemed very stressed and it only made things worse for him. He was thirsty from all the driving and the heat so he tries to get water from a water pump. The water in there was horrible. He called it a "substance" that tasted like battery acid. “If he wasn't lost and it was cool outside, he would have water and he wouldn't be so upset. Setting up a hot and lost place had a huge impact on the rider.

In my opinion, the characteristics of the sale affect the rider in several ways. For example, when he was talking about changing the terair from long roads from strat to a fragment of wind and changing the speed limit, he said. to.

Due to the characteristics of the setting, including the hot summer weather, with the cyclist unfamiliar with the area and the California desert, the cyclist is affected. In Joe Kurmaskie's short story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the cyclist travels through the hot desert in June when he realizes that he is running out of water : " I had hit my water bottles enough. regularly and I traveled through the high deserts of California in June ”(Kurmaskie). This affects the rider because he heats up and lacks water. In addition, the cyclist realizes that he should never have taken the lead of the elderly and thinks to himself : " ... The growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke by a magnificent June day ”(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is wreaking havoc on it.

The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist. I think the setting was supposed to look the most like a run down city, which didn't help when he got lost. The city is old fashioned and hot. Which brings another problem, the rider was getting dehydrated because he didn't have enough water. He would have fun and see things that weren't there. He became very tired under the scorching sun. Thus, the installation in these short stories affected the cyclist in several ways.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because the condition in which it is found is without water. the rider would be fine if he had had more water for his trip. He ran out of water so as not to continue his journey thanks to the heat of the decor in which he was. The cyclist makes this statement. I banged my water bottle quite regularly and traveled to the high desert of California in June ”. The cyclist says that since it is so hot where he is, he needs to drink water regularly to keep him informed throughout his trip. It also says that in the mountains with less air and how hot it is, he is not doing as well as he thought during the trip.

The rider had a difficult trail to go to get to @ LOCATION1. It is easy to ride a bike if you are on flat, smooth terrain, when you come up on hills, it makes it much more difficult. The rider said: “ I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. It was also very hot. he was sweating and dehydrated, "I once read that sucking stones helps forget about thirst." he had eighteen miles to the next town without much water. The first deserted city had no drinking water. It was very difficult to cycle in these conditions, and it is important to always be prepared and to know where you are going.

In Joe Kurmaskie's " Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @ CAPS1 ", the imagery is what drives the rider back. The scorching dessert and the plant life give her a feeling of isolation and scare her. Because the rider is in the dessert, he continues to worry about his water and heatstroke while as if he were in a rainforest, he wouldn't worry about the water or the heat. heat. I think he got disgusted just by stepping back into his surroundings. If the rider had imagined water all around him and arctic temperatures, I think he wouldn't have been so worried. What's interesting about this story is that if he had mentally prepared for the conditions, he wouldn't have struggled so much in the end. "At one point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really looked like a diamond back blocking most of the sidewalk in front of me." (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). If the word cyclist focused more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him, I think he would have been successful without so much stress.

The characteristics of the scenery affect the cyclist in that it makes him exhaust his water reserves and tests his determination. “Sometimes life can be so cruel” implies that he was having a horrible time facing the surroundings he found himself in.

In the essay " Rough road ahead: don not exeed high speed limit", the author is continually depressed by the characteristics of the landscape he is crossing. At first he walks past a ghost town, but since he has enough water he doesn't mind the sight. But the next thing he sees is a dilapidated old shed and a "rusty water pump", and that bothers him because he's running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake that doesn't help his mood as the snake blocks its way and then passes an abandoned Welch's grape juice factory and despairs of never finding water. Adjusting its characteristics serves to depress the rider in his quest to find water.

In the story “ Rough Road ahead ; Do not exceed the posted speed limit ”, a cyclist is confronted with many problems. It's really hot outside, practically a desert and it's June. Just knowing that it makes me want a little water. In addition, this cyclist is running out of water and still hasn't reached where he needs to be. The roads are hilly and bumpy, making it difficult for him. These are the problems this cyclist faces.

At first, the narrator of Do not exceed the posted speed limit was energetically enthusiastic about their trip to Yosemite National Park. After receiving useful advice on a few shortcuts, the cyclist sets off on the adventure. The first thing they encounter is the ghost town. The gentlemen that they had sound advice had assured them that it was a thriving prosperous city. This sparked the first wave of doubt in the minds of cyclists. Then the lack of water started. They were traveling through the high desserts of California in June and were slowly running out of water. The road was quickly replaced by short rolling hills which only increased the cyclist's state of delirium. After a few more disappointments, the cyclist decides that there is no more hope and that he is going to die. cyclist. All the disappointments set the stage for the end of the cyclist and you can't stop reading because you have to find out what's going on.If it wasn't for the desperation of t he wouldn't care .

When the cyclist goes on a trip, he crosses like a desert. All he sees during the entire trip is a flat ride and some dirt. He rolls on the road; Desperately hoping for some form of LIF. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. “The author tries to be positive, but it's difficult, because all this setting makes you lose hope. How would you like if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert. Now if the setting had been a beautiful green forest, he would not be so worried, there is water and shade. He has none of that in the wilderness. This whole trip was all mental. He always kept in mind that everything would be fine. This is what helped him survive. It's a compelling story, for anyone who needs a helping hand to remain an optionist.

The wrong directions of heat and the lack of water affect the cyclist in the story. At the start of the story, the rider is confident in directions that would "cut hours off my ride to Yosemite National Park." As the story progresses, the rider is no longer so confident. "California heat on June day makes her fluent in drinking water." I banged my water bottle quite regularly and traveled to the high deserts of California in June. This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was on the verge of heat stroke. “I calmed down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. He braved the elements and imposed himself, in the hope that any source of water would be revealed to him. His persistence paid off. “ Then, as easily as in a turn, my problems, my thirst and my fear were all behind me. The cyclist had found a barst shop and corrected the water.             

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of @ LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has hardly any water left. This lack of water makes the cyclist desperate for food and water. The tuning has a lot to do with how the rider reacts to what is going on.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. First, because there was no one in sight, he couldn't ask for help or direction. Also due to all the road conditions it was difficult to cycle on all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated which didn't help him it just made him more tired. Another reason is because of poisonous snakes if he bothered them, they might harm him. Also, if he had fallen off his bike, a snake could have bit him and he couldn't get anywhere because of the bite. It was the characteristics of the frame that affected the rider.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the story setting affect the rider both physically and mentally. This affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to traverse and the lack of water he has. The hills make it tired and weak with the rough terrain. The lack of water does not help anyone when they are thirsty because of the hills. Traits affect him mentally because the further he goes, the more dangerous he becomes. Every more mile he keeps telling himself, if I can just make it, I'll be fine. He also reproaches himself for having listened to old people. And with that, too, came doubt. He doubted he could support him. In the story it says: "It didn't really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean". mentally he couldn't do it.

When the cyclist was riding his bike in such daytime conditions, he started to need water so he lacked water. His whole adventure therefore consisted in finding water. Being thirsty was very hard because it made him want to stop because he was so tired. It made him harder on him. But it also gave him more strength and because in himself, and continues to push.

"Staying within the posted speed limit" tells a story of learning and determination, as a cyclist cycles through the deserts of California on a bicycle, encountering obstacles such as snakes and lack of water along the way. . The descriptive characteristics of the setting greatly affect the protagonist throughout his journey. The test takes place in early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he particularly notes "the serenity of an early summer evening" and ends the day serenely. The next morning, he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to cycle again. The heat rises as the day progresses and around midday the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues to reach new lands, hills. Here he begins to lose hope and is disappointed when it appears that the "town" he was hoping to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die from the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the last turn, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop to draw water, he is finally relieved.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example, the story says "I picked up some pebbles and put them in my mouth".

The complex characteristics of the frame negatively affect the rider throughout this story. His journey goes from bad to worse as he progresses towards Yosemite. After taking the instructions from the "old coders", the author tries the shortcut, but is disappointed. He arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted. He erased it, however, and kept "the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite" as his motivation. He continued to pedal, but started to run out of water when he got to a well, found the water to be inedible and continued on. As if things couldn't get worse, her trail was getting rougher and rougher and her water supply was low. The cyclist becomes dehydrated and begins to lose hope. He became even more pessimistic when "a ridiculously large snake blocked most of the sidewalk ...". He even put stones in his mouth to help him get dehydrated. When he finally found the fishing camp, he was relieved. All the obstacles he overcame were worth it in the end.

The journey of a lone cyclist is lonely. The cyclist of "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" had a particularly difficult course, made worse by the frame. His main opponent in the battle to stay alive was the heat. In the Californian deserts like a June day. It was no surprise that the sun would heat up especially harder than it would somewhere else at any time. In addition, as the terrain became more hilly, his journey became even more difficult. There is nothing difficult about riding a flat straight line bike. But constantly riding up steep hills and winding roads isn't a picnic. Like the buildings that surrounded him, the cyclist's water deteriorated as well as his state of mind as his journey, which had started very happy, became more and more Tuesday. "It didn't really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean." This cyclist was fighting against powerful forces of nature.

In the new "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" Joe Kurmaskie, the frame plays an extremely important role. The story takes place in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling at around 20 km / h. much worse dehydration situation. “ I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean. " The cyclist was losing hope, but he was still determined to find water.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because they have started to disturb her mind. She did not know where she was and on the hip got lost. That you can't see anything around. You or many around you are going to be afraid. They have the same effect. In the case of the perpetrators, she was cycling and could / could not water. It is an overwhelming feeling because you can die of dehydration. She then continued to ride a bicycle and saw nothing. “ No insight ; not a building, car or structure of any kind. This means that there is no water or people around, as if you were just going to die. These settings would affect anyone who encountered them. They definitely affected the cyclist because she was alone and on her way. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike, and an empty water bottle.

The characteristics of this story tend to affect the rider a lot. Because he took a shortcut, he had an even longer trip than before.

The characteristics of the trial setting affected the rider because he first got attached to old fwwks who hadn't left their porch for a decade or so.

In Joe Kurmaskie's " Do Not Exceed The Posted Speed Limit " essay, the executive negatively affects him because he was on his bike and was in a hot, waterless area like in this quote : " I got down on my hands and knees, working the rusty water pump handle with all my might. A tar-like substance has evaporated. In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but really gets nothing.

The setting of the story greatly affects the main character due to the heat. The main character is to ride a bicycle in a desert in summer with little water. The heat of the scenery is a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the arid desert, he will die Sarley. The main character says: "The growing awareness that I might fall from heat stroke." The main character is faced with a man-against-nature problem and the heat is winning. The heat and dehydration sap the main character's energy as he travels through a desert on his bicycle, desperately trying to make his way to the nearby town. In summary, the biggest problem with the main characters is the warmth of the setting.

The frame around the rider affected him in a major way. “About forty miles in the pedal, I came to the first 'town' (Kurmaskie). The rider put the words cities in the parentage because it was actually a ghost town. no one lived there, it was abandoned. Around the cyclist there were deserts and more empty towns. The more the cyclist's father had become, the more we realized that the old men were wrong, because the cycle was running out of water and there was nowhere to stop. He eventually found some and vowed never to listen to the ancient instructions of men again.

All the characteristics of the region have a strong impact on the cyclist. It's a hot June morning, and he's on his bike, pedaling hard, covering many miles. He cannot find water, because all the towns along the route are deserted. He becomes dehydrated and loses strength. It seems he collapsed if he hadn't thought he was going to @ CAPS1, and if he hadn't had water in that store. Overall, the decor seems to be intended for the king.

The characteristics of the decorative " Rough Road : Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit " Joe kurmaskie affect the cyclist very negatively. It starts slowly with the " ghost town ". continued, ”he wasn't particularly worried, but the fact that he checked his water suggests that he will have to ration it for a while. The decline continues when it reaches the herd and the "dilapidated shed." "@ CAPS1 the description of the place shows you that he didn't like it, and he confirms that with the words," this sight was disturbing. " He wouldn't fill up with water here. pessimism.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider as he had little water, he had to pedal harder to get over slopes and he became dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had little water because he had taken the instructions from the old men and probably didn't bring as much as he would if he had taken a longer path. In addition, to climb the hills, he had to pedal faster and harder. This affected him as he would have been more exhausted from the peddling. In addition, it was a day in June and in June the days are hot with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. On the one hand, his body heat increased a bit. They don't go out and say it, but they say, “ The sun was starting to beat.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in a major way. On the one hand, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California, the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing the characteristics of anyone in the frame, you would change the behavior of the rider in the frame. Thus changing the whole plot of the story. If the cyclist was, for example, in the entrance or in a simple landscaped area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The tuning functions have a huge effect on the rider.

In Joe Kurmaskie's story "Rough Road Ahead: Don't Exceed the Posted Speed Limit", the frame characteristic seems negative for the rider. The setting seems to start to worry the rider two miles after saying he could easily ride the next @ NUM1 miles. For example, the cyclist says, “ Not two miles in this next section of the trip, I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced with short hills, “ the rider seems worried at this point that things won't be as easy as they thought. From that point on, the setting seemed to get worse for the rider. Later, the cyclist ended up saying “ It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean. It was then that the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up being successful and he realized how much nature can have on you.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider by unexpected events. His water supply was quickly drunk and he could not find a town nearby. He was in desert California, and the sun was beating down on him. When he made a town, it was more of a "ghost town" and its pumps were rusty and tasted like battery oil. Every person he asked told him she was close, but due to the dehydration it took longer. the roads became windy and small hills occurred. There was a big snack in the middle of the road, as the weed passed. they finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool off.

The setting in " Rough Road Ahead : Do not @ CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit With the speed limit has definitely affected published author.

The speaker said: “ I could have heatstroke ” (Kurmaskie @ NUM2). The speaker suggests that it is so hot outside that he could pass out from a "heat stroke" which could slow him down. The speaker also states : " the water feels somewhere in the vicinity of two hundred degrees " (Kurmaskie @ NUM3). The author did not have good water to drink, as it was very hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated. Many aspects of the frame affected the rider.

The setting of this news has a great impact on the cyclist. As the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The rider only packed enough water for the intended trip. As he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There was no sign of civilization, so he couldn't stop nowhere and buy water. He came to a rusty "run down" faucet and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this news had a different frame, then the story wouldn't make much sense. For example, if the story had taken place at @ LOCATION1, he could have just stopped and bought some water. The setting is one of the most important parts of a story.

The characteristics affect the rider in several ways. For example the road, the rocks close everything. The cyclist should know everything about where he is going, because otherwise he may encounter some problems along the way, for example, snakes, rough terrain, rocks on the way. This is why it is important for a cyclist not to listen to anyone other than himself. That's why when you see cyclists, you see them around, a road where there are cars, just in case they get in trouble.

Sometimes when the frame characteristics are bad it can have a big impact on the rider. For example, if it is too hot, the rider will need a lot of water if they do not want to become dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat stroke and deadly snakes, cyclists may want to avoid this. When you are a cyclist, times can be tough, just prepare for the long haul.

The frame of the story “ Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed the posted speed limit ” really goes against the rider and his journey. This is because in the places it goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page @ NUM1 it says “ a tar-like substance seeped out, but the water was not cooling ”. This explains how bad the water was when the rider was there.

The feature of the setting included beautiful cool pine trees and a gost town and it was hot and bansier of @ CAPS1 and snacks and posine hills that were getting harder and harder to climb. When he started the pines were nice and cool, but when he scanned the city gost he thought to himself he started to get hot and saw the snack and he was was a gray baby and was nuvves and dehydrated. as the hills started to make it harder and harder, that was how it was.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as they have to use more energy to pedal through hills and over rocky terrain. Therefore, he drank more water. When he counted.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat and then turned into hills. The cyclist was getting tired from pedaling. “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills. " It was tired faster because an uphill climb is harder than riding on flat ground. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was "traveling through the high deserts of California in June." It is a very hot time of year, and when a person gets lost without conserving water, which they did not, a person is extremely thirsty. Not to mention the "shortbread photo of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth", which would remind the body of its thirst. So the tuning definitely affected the rider

In the story, the cyclist is greatly affected by the characteristics of the scenery. For example, the parameter has nothing for miles. Just ghost towns, it is impossible to find water. It is also a desert setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, which made him even more thirsty. It was June in California, so it must have been quite hot and the town where he was supposed to had no water because they seemed helpless. Another example is the condition he put under his tongue. This is a trick that allows you to survive much more effectively. Therefore, the settings affected his trip and made him regret not following the old man's advice.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. Three characteristics I found were lack of water, heat, and road conditions and limitations. The lack of water really affected the rider. When he died he tried not to drink anything. The essay indicated how he / she would say he / she would save water until the end. He was so tired that the lack of water really affected him. The conditions he was in also greatly affected the rider. From the start, he was told in the wrong directions. This was the reason why he / she was lost all the time. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. The hills and different terrain did not help the rider. In conclusion, the cyclist had several factors affecting him such as the lack of water, the limits of the road and its conditions.

I think the characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. First, I think the weather conditions affect it. I think this is because in the passage it says, " I might fall from heatstroke ." That is to say, it is really hot ! Also, I think the fact that he's out of water affects him because it says in the passage “ I calmed myself down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydration state ”. This has a great effect on him because he is very thirsty. Also, I think the fact that there is nothing around him affects him. I think that because in the passage it says that there were no cars. I think all of these things affect him.

In “ Do not exceed posted speed limit ” by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the rider. The cyclist takes advice from a few old people and ends up regretting never having done so. He is on a deserted road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all the water he has and has to stop some more. I knocked out my water bottles quite regularly and traveled to the high deserts of California in June. He stopped to get more water, but one time all that came out was tar, and then he couldn't find another place for a whole blank. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills and he let out a sigh that read " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the speed limit ", and passed weeds and a big snake. All of these things impacted his trip with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to have a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot and empty, he was more thirsty so the setting affected the rider.

He feels lonely, there is no one around to push him, and yet he keeps trying to push himself to the end to win. The fast roads are rough and the hills are high but he is determined to finish.

The heat, abandoned roads, snakes are all reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat caused him to dehydrate faster while he was consuming energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt that he would experience the entire bike ride. He used all his water. So when it got to the old pump, dirty hot water came out. The serpent of the story made this guy's journey perilous and deadly. It all happened because he listened to the old people. When the other old man was about to tell him where to go, he said no.       

<START>

 

The features and setting affect the rider a lot. One of the reasons was that he was in the wilderness. As in the quote "through the high deserts of California." This means it was hot and he could pass out from heatstroke. Then he couldn't even get any water. Like the quote "from the rusty water pump". it described the age the rider got out of it, but it tasted like old battery acid. Therefore, the features and the setting affected the rider.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider intensely over a period of time. Destined to reach Yosemite National Park from Lodi, Calif., A determined cyclist rode hard in the balmy evening. When the setting changed, the effect it had on the rider also changed. When the man reached the first city, which was deserted, the energy started to run out because the sun started to enter the image. Then he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with contaminated and unsanitary water. When the flat land turned into hills, the man was completely exhausted ”. With what I thought was my last burst of energy, I hurtled down the hill. This quote directly describes how the man felt and how the hills affected him. When the man came across a fish camp with water, he was recharged and recharged with the confidence he had before when he " arrived in the morning with strong legs and a smile "

The frame affected the rider in several ways. For example, he was driving in the desert and all the towns he went to were abandoned. The month was June, a hot month and the sun was beating down on it. And he was riding his bike with very little water.

In the test " Do not display speed limit @ CAPS1 ", the parameter affects the rider in several ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This affected the rider as he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking forward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite, so he persevered. The setting for the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes, and an enclosure that " couldn't fit in the crappy mule ." This made the rider more worried about which way to go as he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist ran out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. This is how the various settings affected the rider.

The author's frame described difficult terrain and difficult weather conditions for cycling. The author said it was the start of summer, which means the weather could be hot and uncomfortable for the rider. The author also indicated that when the cyclist reached the first city, the sun started to heat up. This means that the temperature will increase as the sun gets stronger. Cycling in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster as the heat makes you sweat which decreases your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the location of the cyclist. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you an idea of how much hotter it is since it travels through deserts in early summer when the sun is high. After the first couple town, he begins to roll over short rolling hills. Hills have a greater impact on a person's body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider. From ghost town to bait shop, it was quite a challenge for him. A deceptive challenge, But a challenge. In the desert, he lacked water and he tried everything to surpass himself. To look at the horizon to get from one place to another, to suck stones so as not to concentrate on the water. And when he gets to the bait shop. A feeling of relief came to her, as if this shop was her refuge. But yet, he would never get instructions from an elder again. Lack was not a factor in this story. Rather, it was the dynamism and general climate of the story. When there were only two hundred degrees left and there was no more water, he pushed himself towards the light. And also when he saw a building, he was determined to go there.

The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The rider was in Lodi, Calif., When he decided to ask old coders for directions so he could take a shortcut. He followed their instructions and he didn't know he should have stuck to his original instructions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The rider got very hot and thirsty after traveling in the desert. It says in the text "when I tried a drop or two it tasted like battery acid". This shows that he had no more water to keep him dehydrated throughout his trip. In addition, in the text it says "with what I thought was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill", it shows that he had no more energy.

In the essay “ Rough Road Ahead ; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit "Joe Kurmaskie, he reviews all kinds of settings where things could get better or worse. “ I noticed that the terrain was changing, the flat roads were replaced by short bearings @ NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that things might get a little more difficult now because he will have to go up hills and he is almost out of water. “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind” (@ NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains why the man could not get water or move from anywhere in the vicinity because there was nothing to do. This is how the characteristics of the frame affected cyclists.

Almost all of the characteristics of the settin affect the rider. For example, the hot weather causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it is said how thirsty and sweaty he is. “Bottles of water only contain a few mouthwatering sips. Large rings of softness encircled my shirt. These descriptions suggest that he is very hot since he is cute and has been drinking so much. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make it feel like it will never reach the next town. "I started breaking the ride in distress that I could have it tested for." He gives the impression that the commute is a lot of short trips so he can do it.

Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles are no longer sure that he can make it, finally, passing the sign saying : your best bet, "the cyclist has reached a hopeful stage, as he knew he had regained civilization.I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can affect your general mood, and this is true today with the cyclist.

The way the tuning characteristics affect the rider is to either make the ride easy for him or difficult for him. In the essay it was written "No city", but without city there is no water and water @ MONTH1 leads to dehydration. It also says something about the flat roads that turn into " short, rolling hills ". This meant that the path he had to travel was difficult and it was difficult for the rider to stay focused. These are some examples of the frame affecting the cyclist.

In the test " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", many characteristics of the frame affected the rider. And these parameters could be easily formed in the middle part of the test. And these settings caused the cyclist's exasperation on his journey. First, the rider noticed a change in course from flat hills to short, rolling hills. He had to expend more energy to climb the hills, which caused him to lose a certain amount of energy. Then, her lack of water caused her to become dehydrated. He might lose another large amount of energy because of it and apart from this step he mostly needs someone to support him or be by his side, but he was riding alone, there was no one in there. sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. It could make her emotion collapse and waste her energy. Overall, the cyclist suffered a loss of energy on his journey. And couldn't have had a follower to help

The setting affects the rider as it can provide cues and directions. For example, the narrator states, "They looked so confident when pointing out landmarks and towns I would come to along this windy jaunt" (Kurmaskie @ NUM1).

In the story "Rough Road Ahead: Staying Within the Posted Speed Limit", the cyclist encounters some very difficult obstacles on his way to Yosemite National Park. With his lack of water and his distress, he runs into a large snake that he thinks is a black diamond. He easily passes the snake and moves on. Being in the intense heat and with known water, he never gives up and knows he can get to the park safely. The reason it goes that way is because @ NUM1 "alumni who haven't left the confines of their front porches since Carter was in the office." These guys gave him the wrong directions. It really affected the rider because all the other things wouldn't have happened if he had paid attention to his surroundings and the people around him.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider on different occasions in different ways. For example, upon arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues with confidence. The next building he saw was an abandoned Welch juice bottle factory, on the building was a chant with a boy drinking a glass of cold juice. This intimidates the seeker who begins to question the wisdom of old men. Continuing, he reaches another building. Much to his relief, it was a bolt shop that was still in operation. He immediately goes to the sink to drink the water at this point, he is relieved to have the water near civilization instead of being in the dessert with no view of life or the building. Therefore, his surroundings throughout history make him indifferent, confident and relieved.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider because the roads are rough, uneven and he has to put more energy to pedal on rough and uneven roads and then on nice, paved and even roads and he is also short of water, so this is once again using all of its energy without any redaveanator.

The tuning effect of a cyclist can be a bit complicated. So much needs to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. You must first prepare for the weather. For example, when there is severe weather condition like rain, snow, you should pay attention to ley roads. In addition, they must be prepared for long journeys. Some naes can be @ NUM1 miles and need to bring plenty of food and water. Another effect that a cyclist should assess is the condition of the bike. For example, he / she must make sure that the bikes are in good condition and will cooperate. In addition, if work needs to be done on the bicycle, the bicycle can be worked. Another effect of a cyclist is also that the cyclist is in good shape. For example, if the cyclist is in good shape, he can ride for a long time. Finally, another effect is that the cyclist must know where he is going. For example, the man in the story didn't know where to go, so this is an important key point.

The setting of where cyclsit travels affects the rider. The reason I say this is because in the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" the rider came across a conflict with the setting. The conflict was very hot and he didn't use little things to survive, which he did. This is the reason why I say that the setting of where cyclsit travels is important.

The framework of the news ; "Rough Road Ahead: Not exceeding the speed limit" greatly affects the rider. The rugged terrain and the blazing sun test and hurt him in ways he never imagined. One point, after the cyclist rode for hours, he notes: “On a long crippling hill, a building appeared. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage… ”this setting made the rider so dehydrated he couldn't think anymore. The cyclist knows the dangers of the surroundings.

In the “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ” test. The rider is affected by the adjustment mentally and physically. For example, the setting mentally affected the cyclist because everything was dessert and sand without water. He thought he was going to die, he said "I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean." If he had had water, he wouldn't have thought of this. In addition, the cyclist was physically affected because the road was rough, it looked like it could last forever. He was losing energy and getting tired of climbing all the hills with little water in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless, but if he had walked through the evergreen forest I don't think he would have felt that way. In conclusion, the rider was affected by the frame both physically and mentally if he hadn't been riding in the desert he wouldn't feel that way.

In the essay, "Rough Road Ahead", the character sees many parameters throughout his journey, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes a place he came to as, "a dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't fit in the slightest mute greeted me. The view was disturbing," it was the turning point where the cyclist started to worry. He ran out of water, "The sun was starting to beat," and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to the hills. It affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick it up. When he finally arrived in a "modernized" city his morale was uplifted and he was able to get some water to cool off, which gave him more strength and will to continue his journey to Yosemite Park.

The setting of the story has a huge impact as it was such an empty terran that forced him to rely only on himself due to the lack of others to help him. For example, if he drove through a city for hours on end, he could stop and take a break in a store or get water just about anywhere. But being in the wilderness, it really tested his inner strength to go on and get to safety.

In the test, I can conclude that there were many characteristics of the terrain that affected the rider. For example, in the text it is written “ a ridiculously large snake… blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me ”. If you are very scared of snakes, it could ruin your entire trip. The cyclist was scared, but the fear passed and moved on. The lack of water has also changed the cyclist. Not having enough water could be bad. As stated “ I could leave the heat store on a beautiful June day… ” There are many characteristics that have affected the rider and their trip.

In the article by Joe Kurmaskie, "Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit", there are several characteristics that affect the cyclist. “ ..And I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ” (Kurmaskie) The deserts in June are extremely hot and dry and resulted in rapid dehydration of the rider. “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills.

The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was crossing the deserts in June. The cyclist barely had water at the end of the rock. Many buildings were abandoned just when he needed water. This is how the frame affected him.

In the upcoming rough road test, the setting affects the rider as he's been pedaling for so long and he's getting dehydrated. “ I touched my water bottles quite regularly. I was in @ LOCATION1 ". Another reason the scenery affects him is that he's starting to see mirages.   

<START>

 

Characteristics such as not enough water, not enough sense of direction affect the rider as he needs water to keep pedaling. He needs maps to know in which direction and where he is going. Because of the lack of water, he said: " I was going to die and the birds would pick me up cleanly, leaving only expensive outdoor gear and a lost entrance in place of the old men, their wisdom and their senses." orientation. I have made a mental note to change this paragraph. This site mentioned that the old man's sense of direction was outdated. They didn't know where something was right there in a giant pool.     

<START>

 

The characteristics of the setting is that it is hot and dry. The way this affects the rider is that he is very hot and drinks most of his water and only has about @ NUM1 sips left when he gets to the other town. It also affects him because he had an advantage. The advantage he had was that he was gone before sunrise. So he had time to calm down. Another part of the frame that affects the rider is that when he even goes up some hills, he gets a bit of wind. Also, when the cyclist was thirsty, he would put stones in his mouth.      

<START>

 

The frame plays a crucial role in the mood and energy of the rider. For example, on a cool day of @ DATE1 on a gentle descent, the rider is happy and energetic. However, “ traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best place to laugh and relax. The cyclist in the story was exhausted and hydrated. He thought, "I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean." » Where the cyclist is cycling can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself.

For a cyclist, the surrounding environment can cause triumph or despair. The cyclist received very old instructions. He was given back roads which are now abandoned. These towns normally had no populations that wouldn't matter, but he was "traveling the high deserts of California in June." (@ NUM1). If there was shade, breeze and weather @ NUM2 he would be fine, but he rides a bike in a desert in the summer. A "ghost town" without clean water could have killed him. A cyclist must know his surroundings and be prepared for what nature has in store for him.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in different ways. First of all I think when the cyclist passed through the “ghost town” he felt lonely and discouraged. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and that there was no one to help him. Also, the long hilly road with nothing but desert on either side essentially gave him the disheartening feeling that this road was never going to end and that there was no way out of it. had begun. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry there was no water in sight and it made him thirstier than he was. Overall I think it had some really physical and psychological effects on him.

The setting of this story plays a huge role in the end result. The author mentions that he travels through the high deserts of California in June. That sentence alone tells the reader it's hot.

In addition, the author comes to a sign that read "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit". @ CAPS1, he notes that it is only going at 12 mph. Before reaching any civilization, he has already drunk most of its water, his last "tempting sips", that is his main problem, his lack of water.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere getting dehydrated. There was no sign for the rest areas where you can find water fountains around. The cyclist put stones in his mouth to try and forget about thirst. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just continued and her words were "I was going to die." First the cyclist risked becoming dehydrated, and ended her satisfaction. The cyclist survived seeing Gary and Wilber's fish camp. Its setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and brought him back to life.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in many cases. The cyclist had ridden in the "high deserts of California in June". The cyclist also saw a "ridiculously large snake". There was also no sign of civilization for miles. There was not a single glimpse, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist went through many different obstacles, trying to get to Yosemite. I think the settings affected the rider in several ways.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect cyclists. Things like weather, terrain, temperature, altitude can make or break a cyclist. In this test, the heat and the unevenness of the road challenge the cyclist. He just keeps crossing, and finally he comes to civilization.

The particularity of the decor greatly affected the cyclist. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would cover the eighteen miles until he crossed the flat, which was replaced by short hills. He said and I quoted "I toiledon", it looks like it's hopeless, he's not going to make it. As you can see, the setting affects the rider.

The setting of " Do not exceed posted speed limit " was very hot deserts. On a bike ride, there aren't many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride, you can't bring a lot of hire with you. Only important materials and a fairly large water jug. An example of the text to show how bad it was there. “I got down on all fours and on my knees, working the rusty pump handle with all my might.

In the frame, the young man is faced with challenges that make him, as an individual, a stronger person. For example he was proud of himself he made himself happy by saying at the end "yes sir!

The staging of the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" affects the rider as it is a dry area in California in June. The rider really needs water which is the main thing besides being lost in a ghost town. So lack of water and misleading indications are the main features displayed.

The characteristic of the cyclist was very good "it eats away at who he says in paragraph @ NUM1 @ CAPS1". I would describe it as funny. It also looks like this time was one of his best. Here are some examples where he is happy, competitive, and slim is full. I will explain my examples. First of all he looks hoppy because in the story he said "in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. The phase can show you how hoppy he felt. My second example was competitive he seems to be a competitive person because he is very healthy and driven to take a bike ride. My third example is the way he is because he said "As easily as a sound link , my troubles , my thirst and my fears were all behind me, the part made me feel.

In the story “ Do not exceed the posted speed limit ” by Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider. We can tell because the author writes “this road has been replaced by short hills” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). This tells us that the cyclist is difficult to ride on the road. The speed limit also affects the cyclist. When the speed limit sign appears, the character gets the impression that " life can be so cruel " (kurmaskie @ NUM1). He tells us that the character cannot do what he is trying to do. The bad road and the sigh of speed limit affect the cyclist.

In the test, the frame characteristics affected the rider. At first the scenery was with the old man and the rider was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and ran out of water, he was overwhelmed and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived, but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store, he was excited and relived. This is how the frame affected the rider on his journey

In the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit", many characteristics of the frame affect the rider. First of all, at the beginning of the story it is said that " the sun was starting to beat ", the temperature was starting to rise, but it didn't really affect the rider as he had a lot of water. Then the story goes, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” the temperature in California is really hot, and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. It affected the rider because he was tired, hot and dehydrated. Finally, by the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as the pavement as it was a dirt road and the hills required the cyclist to pedal. stronger to overtake it. very tired. In addition, the temperature was still very high and he was almost out of water. By the end of the ride, the setting of the roads, temperature and distance of the ride had left the rider exhausted and dehydrated.

In the new ' Rugged road ahead. Do not exceed the posted speed limit ”, The cyclist encountered many difficulties. These difficulties were the result of the decor. The story takes place in " the high deserts of California in June ". The month of June is very hot and the Californian climate is generally hot and dry, the rider has encountered problems. Not only did this affect the cyclist, but he made it through the desert. The setting also included several abandoned towns along the way, which contributed to the problem. The cyclist soon ran out of water and discovered that the towns in front of him were unoccupied. He had no choice but to continue his journey.    

<START>

 

The characteristics of the rider tuning effect are in many different ways. One of the reasons is that the rough terrain makes him work harder and exhausts him. As the cyclist becomes exhausted, he needs to drink more and more water. Now that he drinks more water, he runs out of it faster and wants more and more. Then when he starts using less water to conserve it until he gets to the next town, he starts to get dehydrated and tired and he starts to feel weak. Also, because the terrain is hilly, his legs work harder to climb hills and his legs get tired. It is also starting to get hotter and he is thirsty more often. This is how the setting affects the rider.       

<START>

 

In the poem "Do not exceed the speed limit", the frame is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bicycle said he was running out of water. At one point he says “At one point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large quake” This makes the setting dry and empty with a noxious snake around. this man also said about a sign that read " Bumpy road ahead : do not exceed the posted speed limit ", it also made it difficult for the man to drive. These are the parameters that have affected the biker in history.

The “ Do not show speed limits @ CAPS1 ” setting affects the mood of the rider in that every time the setting changes, the mood of the rider changes. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist crosses the " cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite ". @ CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a good mood. As the story continues, "there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure on any terrain." At this point in the story, the cyclist has traded his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out.        

<START>

 

The “ Rough Road Ahead ” setting makes the motorcyclists move a very difficult challenge that they must overcome. When the “ flat road has been replaced by short, rolling hills ,” the rider has to use more energy to climb the hills. This prevented him from overcoming his requirement for physical endurance. In addition, he states that he was "traveling through the high desert of California in June" as the weather is very hot and dry, causing him to quickly run out of water. And, because he was in the wilderness, there was no sign of any cities or people or salvation of any kind. These conditions made it difficult for the rider because he knew that if he fell from dehydration, no one would be there to save him. In conclusion, these difficult conditions challenged the bike a lot.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way he had to cross desert terrain. The scorching sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat made him want water. He had been very tired. The ground had made him soak in sweat. If it wasn't so hot, then it wouldn't have been so hard. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes physical activity more difficult. Even if you must have great endurance. The heat will tire you a lot and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn't help that the old men gave him terrible instructions. That's why I think the tuning affected the rider.

The frame of the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" affects the author in a considerable way. The hallmarks of the decor are that "there was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." The fact that there is nothing around him made the author lose hope and confidence. After the author saw the old juice factory, he got the impression that something was going on in his favor. Then he saw that he was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he is going to die. He shows he has lost faith in old people when he talks about never accepting advice from "old people who haven't left their porch since Carter came to power." In conclusion, the traits of the directions were given to him and lose all hope of survival.

At the start of the race the cyclist feels good and strong and the day and the journey have only just begun. The sun begins to hit the rider but he remains optimistic, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat. When he gets to an old, rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that looks like "battery acid." The terrain starts to look more like a hill, which makes the wrestling even worse. The rider drinks more water now and gets tired. He arrives on a rough road and says "Sometimes life can be so cruel" which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative effects of what he suspects to be a nice bike ride, a snake is blocking its way and it becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshed and relieved at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying sip of water in the toilet. Water is a feature @ NUM1 the setting that cools the rider, while the scorching sun, rough terrain and unfamiliar area are features that make the rider feel lost and tired.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two main parts of the decor, which make him thirsty. "... followed by a sensation of brackish water somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees". This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist feels. Another important characteristic that affects it is the sun. This is how the tuning affects the cylist.

The characteristic effect of the cyclist because he wants to go to a spectacular and incredible place. Like for example he said he thrived in this place forever and he finally got theirs and it was a ghost town and he laughed and ran away because it wasn't what he was looking. I believe this guy judges every place he goes by how he looks and not what he has to offer, like he doesn't believe in getting the direction of an old rug, but he l 'took anyway. I believe he wants to go where he wants to go and not let anyone get in his way, no matter what it is that he is looking for a perfect place and he thinks he wants to find it, it will be full of stories.

The setting can affect a rider in several ways, if it was hot they would be thirsty and sweating. If there were hills, the cyclist would be both tired and thirsty. The thirsty and tired cyclist is determined to cross and find a city. The rider said, “ I started breaking the ride down into distances that I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could go that far it would be fine. In saying this, he knows he can go as far as he is determined to go. The terrain causing him even more problems, would make things more difficult, but he knows he has to overcome his difficult activity but he always keeps a strong mind with it, he can do just about anything because he has the skills. encouragement he needs.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider by changing his mood. In @ LOCATION1, where the weather is nice, shady and cool, he feels pretty good. He is excited and ready to embark on the adventure of a new path. He is always in a good mood when he arrives in the first town. As he moves forward and his water supply runs out, his mood drops and he becomes more and more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate he finds in Welch's Grape Juice, Factory, he's about to resign. He's dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to continue, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief mingles with the distrust of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take the advice of old people for granted again.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame only exhaust the will of the rider. The things he sees put him off, for example a dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn't contain the larger one, mule greeted me. This sight was disturbing. Desolation begins to exhaust his hope of finding a building or a city, sometimes things are psychologically damaging. Grape juice factory and bottling plant. You could still see a shortbread photo of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth. For someone who quickly runs out of water, that irony might make them lose their resolve to continue. The snake and the hills slow it down and make it use more energy. The heat dehydrates the rider even faster. The environment is hostile for a cyclist.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. First, the climate affected him the most, it was because he was too hot, drank a lot, then became dehydrated. He therefore had no more energy due to dehydration. Another is the construction of the road. This is because it was stony, bumpy, winding, dehydrated hills, the road was very tempting to give up and die. Then the heat grabbed him because there was no more shade, no more water and the sun was beating down on him.

During the cycle route, there are many factors that are unfavorable to it. There are rough roads, a bad water pump, an abandoned combat factory, and the long-standing truth that it wasn't even his way. All of these factors create something new in the rider. When the cyclist recovers the first city and realizes that it is diminished, he is initially amused. He then pedals, but realizes that his water is low. Then which is originally a sign of hope because another gave up. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they hit "bumpy roads" creating, once again, a more arduous journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as a poor cyclist is when they arrived with a " tar bait , a sign of civilization that keeps him alive." Hope after hope arises until the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would make him insightful even on a task, but he searched through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Whenever you hear about hope you are entitled to what might happen next, and then you feel sorry for the rider after having hoped over and over again. The stable and salidrifying plot gives the reader the right to want more.

"There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." This adaodoness makes it difficult for the cyclist to hope and know where to find water. “I could have heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, he is in the desert at @ LOCATION1 in June with little water around anyone, it makes him very desperate since he was adadodonne.

The main features that affected the rider were the rough terrain and the scorching sun. The rough terrain made pedaling more difficult and fatigued the rider more quickly. But the scorching sun also helped him as it would dehydrate him while he was riding. Thus, between the rough terrain difficult to pedal and the scorching and dehydrating sun, the cyclist was very affected to the point of exhaustion.

The characteristics of the “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ” test frame affect the rider. As the cyclist travels to his destination, he encounters obstacles and observes his surroundings. The author gives the starting frame in the second paragraph as "a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, Calif., A little earlier." Summer evening. The reader is advised that temperatures are not summer in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With high temperatures, it is easier to get dehydrated quickly. The author said, “The sun was starting to hit and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Additionally, a cyclist encounters a "ridiculously large snake" in the middle of the race. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts that one can encounter while riding a bicycle. Finally, there are many features of the setting that let the rider know where they are now and where they most want to be, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite. @ CAPS1 the test, the rider is determined to make it to Yosemite, and although he is having trouble, he doesn't give up and is relieved when he finally gets some water.

The characteristics of the desert changed the way the speaker viewed his journey. When the road began to change, so did the speaker's determination, " flat roads were replaced by short hills ". The pitch began to change and the speaker grew dubious of the old man who directed him to the shortcut. " I could have suffered from heatstroke on a beautiful day in June just because I listened to gentlemen who had not been out of their porch for decades ." The heat of the desert made the speaker thirsty, making him drink all of his water. There was no source of water, which is why he decided to suck on stone. "I had read once that sucking stones helps to forget thirst". But the rugged terrain did not allow him to do so. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker started to panic, "I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean." But luckily, the author's thoughts changed after finding a source of water, the characteristics greatly affected the rider.

The setting affects the rider in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people and cars on his "shortcut", he had great doubts about his survival. "I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean." He thought he would not have water because there was nothing around him and he thought he would die of dehydration or heat stroke. "And the growing awareness that I would die of heat stroke."

The setting of the story had affected the cyclist in several ways. It was hot when he was driving so he was thirsty. For example, “ The sun was starting to heat up ” (pg @ NUM1). So the sun is very uplifting and made him start to get dehydrated. Another example is a trip through the California desert in June ”(pg @ NUM2). California is a relatively warm state, and June is one of its hottest months. The terrain did not favor the runners either. " The flat road had turned into short rolling hills " (pg @ NUM2). Small rolling hills are harder on the biker body than flat terrain. This is how the setting affected the jumper.

In this paragraph I will explain how the characteristics of the tuning affect the rider. The setting affects the rider in different ways, such as weather, road structure, and animals. All things the rider couldn't control. Thus affecting the cyclist as he crosses.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as it is very hot and it is summer. The cyclist wouldn't have been so tired and exhausted if he hadn't been in a 'ghost town', with the 'sun starting to beat'. It was in @ CAPS1 for nie in June, so it was. Very hot, the water was also NUM1 degrees! The text says there were hills and weeds so it must have been some kind of desert area. The trip was also very long, "about forty miles in the petal", which made him tired. As you can see the setting was an area without people and it was very hot.      

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame are very important for the rider. If the setting is incorrect, they could be in great danger. It is really important to have a clear framework.  

<START>

 

The characteristics of the scenery horribly affected the cyclist! For example, he ran into the worst problems and there was nothing he could do about it. also, he started well and then he started to get dehydrated. He was out of water and was only NUM1 miles down the road. a loss of water was very moving in June while crossing a desert. also, the road damage was very emotional too because it is on a bike and not too good of balance. These characteristics could affect the rider in several ways due to weather conditions, temperature, water loss, road damage and snakes. the cyclist was on a bicycle and couldn't really protect himself, and he was dehydrated and tired.       

<START>

 

Throughout his journey, the protagonist of the story encounters obstacles in the background. First of all, he rides a bike in the hot, dry desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so it faces dehydration. In addition, the terrain on which he was driving proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to climb. There were even signs of a “ bumpy road ahead ” obstacle @ CAPS1 was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory in need of an occupied building. It was ironic and mentally frustrating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @ CAPS2 civilization after finding @ NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more difficult mentally.           

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame would affect the cyclist, as he would like to have cities with water to be able to replenish water. They would like even more water after climbing hills. They would also like a place to eat something and maybe rest.  

<START>

 

The peculiarity of the setting affects the rider due to the heat and the known water. Also how difficult the road was. Another problem was the dry air and the snakes lurking all over the desert. Also the hills were a big problem due to the heat and running water. Finally, the other problem was that he knew he was going to die and that the birds would eat him and that there would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the rider.     

<START>

 

The hot, dry, desert setting affects the rider in different ways : “ I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ” (@ NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but: "A tar-like substance escaped, followed by a sensation of brackish water somewhere in the zoo area (@ NUM2). The water was barely even, so he didn't have much to drink until the next town. " The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills " (@ NUM3). The flat road is much easier to cycle than the hills. He was thirstier and more tired after cycling on hills. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the ground changes. the image of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious and generally exhausted.                  

<START>

 

The characteristics of the tuning affect the rider because when he has water and a lot of water, the tuning feels like a smooth and easy ride. This means it doesn't need to use a lot of water, but it still uses some because anyone who cycles @ NUM1 miles on a bike will need a lot of water, no matter what the terrain. The characteristics of the environment greatly affect the rider in the middle and end of their trip, as it becomes rough and hilly and therefore they need more water than they have. And since he planned on being able to have water on the first stop, he didn't store it as well, so it left him with less water when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he had no more water there, which caused him to become dehydrated. So it seems that the characteristics of the setting affect the rider because when he has a lot of water and doesn't really need it, the terrain is smooth and easy to navigate, but as it goes drinks its water, the terrain becomes more and more rugged. So the features of the frame affect him greatly in that they don't help him, they just worsen when he needs to improve.      

<START>

 

The characteristics affect the rider in several ways. One is that he's already afraid to go up that really big hill. Another is that he's going up that big hill, it's hot, there are snakes, he's scared and tired. Most of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop, he's determined to go up that hill. He also knows that it can't be that bad as he can just relax while coming back down.

After reading Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit ", I noticed that part of this adventure was affecting the narrator. First of all, the heat makes the narrator uncomfortable and more thirsty. While on the move he calls the trip “ water displacement ,” this quote shows he was running out of water and this was a major problem. He also refers to the road as " rolling hills ", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This reduces the narrator's hope of getting there quickly. In addition, the desert gives the author little hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally.       

<START>

 

The frame of the story affected the rider because he held it up because he was on his own and had no help. First, the mere fact that he was alone kept his resolve at a high level. If he had had a partner, they could have stopped and taken a break or shared the water. Then the fact that there were no buildings or houses or anything in sight affected him. He got a flash of strength just by seeing a building in front of him. If there had been a building, he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he's in a desert in California in mid-June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to improve the situation in his cause. He even, at one point, felt that he was in danger of dying. In conclusion, the tuning really affected the rider as it determined their stamina and willpower.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider in different ways. For example, he asks the older guts, " who haven't left their porches since Carter was in the office where the next place was to draw water." He was also in the middle. It was also in June when it was hot and there was not much water.

Many characteristics of the frame affect the rider. First he was in the "high desert of California in June". It affected him in many ways. This makes him very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew stones to collect the saliva in his mouth. In addition, the road has become very rough. The new terrain forced him to push harder and lose energy faster. The last characteristic would be the distance. He must have traveled much further than he expected. It again affected his energy and mind with thoughts of possible death and not being able to make it. This is how some of the frame characteristics affected the rider.          

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. As the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere, he could not get water. " I had read once that sucking stones helped to forget about thirst, " he was so thirsty that he hardly had any energy to continue, " The growing awareness that I could suddenly fall. heat ”, it was hot and he had no water, which affected his energy.      

<START>

 

The tuning characteristics affect the rider. The harsh turane proved to be a challenge when her water supply was low and all the towns had been abandoned, leaving her with no recharge. The heat was also a factor which made him quickly weary and tired. On the bike ride, he had a glimmer of hope at an old water pump, but was quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted like battery acid. The frame sparked the conflict and helped get the tone the perpetrator was looking for to affect the rider.    

<START>

 

The settings affect the rider by the roughness of the ride. First of all, they pass over a pile of rocks, and the tire could break out. Then it could be smooth and easy. In addition, it could be far from cities and difficult to recover. There could be a lack of water which is dehydrating you. This is how the frame around the rider might affect him.

The setting described in the story, "Rough Road Ahead: Staying Within the Speed Limit", would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker rides in the middle of a desert on a summer day. The sweat that falls on him only accelerates his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states that "large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke" (Kurmaskie). It shows how hot the desert was and how it could fall dead. The wilderness is also deserted by tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as it passed abandoned towns and factories. The danger for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have come out alive from these surroundings.

The desert area of California made him dehydrated. The trip was long but he had enough water to get there only if he took the route of the maps. The old men who "haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter took office" pointed out a shortcut he took and nearly killed him from heatstroke and dehydration. If the rider had followed the map he might have stopped at a store for more water if the frame was that bad.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a booming city, the events of history would not have happened. The author asked a group of old people for directions to Yosemite National Park and, "like a foolish yuuth," heeded their advice. Everything started well until he reached the second city. He -ans almost dehydrated and "in an ironic twist" he reached over foctary abandoned grape juice. Almost all hope was lost for him until he crossed the bend and stumbled upon his new hope : "Gary and Wilber's Fish camp - if you don't go big, we're your best bet." card in place of the elderly who "did not leave the limits of their purchase, hce carter was, h office"

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider as he first realized that it would be pointless to seek advice from people who no longer drive or even leave the porch. When the author says "old folks who aren't afraid to confine their porches since Carter was in power," that's what he's explaining. Then he said, “I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face,” he was referring to how he's on the bike alone rode and there's not a glimpse of any car where all around. The edges of the turns were so crisp that only a bike could make them as safe as him "He whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage and tried not to get excited" @ CAPS1 in this situation would have made a lot of people excited about the long lonely cycle by itself.

The features of the setting affected the rider making their way to Yosemite National Park a longer, harder, and more dangerous route. He's in awe of some old people who he says "haven't come out of those porches since Carter came to power." I think there would be a reason not to listen to them although they @ MOIS1 have some wisdom.

In the frame there are no cars and no buildings, which means no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he has no more water. No one was there because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but continued to travel to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were a lot of hills. Besides having to climb hills on a bicycle, he almost collided with a snake. It was hot, he had no water, he could have died.

The setting characteristics of the story " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit " greatly affect the rider. For example, the heat constantly dries the rider. In addition, in the first city, the old water pump turned out to be a hopeless cause, the water tasting like "battery acid". Even after that there were more problems. There was a sign indicating a maximum speed limit. The rider was doing about a fifth that speed. It affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along the way. The pebbles he found are helping him. He remembers reading that putting pebbles in his mouth quenches his thirst. Finally, the bait shop gave him the relief he needed at the end of his trip. In conclusion, the frame takes the riders on a journey , but in the end, the bait shop had exactly what it needed.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider. For example their cities were not close. One of the reasons it affected the rider is that if the towns were close to each other, if there was a lack of water, there would be shops nearby. Also, he could get heat stroke and there would be no one around to get help and he could easily die. From my reading perspective, I think where he was was what affected him the most.    

<START>

 

The hot weather dehydrates the cyclist, who can no longer find water. The hills are rugged terrain that drains the energy it has. The heat is so severe that he has to cut the road to the countries he wants to reach. He is exhausting himself physically and emotionally. He has a difficult journey.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider on how hydrated or not the nature of life he has been. On the "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" messages, this is after "large rings of dried sweat have quenched my thirst and the growing awareness that I might fall from heat stroke on a beautiful day of June". This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. "A tar-like distance rose, followed by naughty water smelling a track of about two hundred degrees." Cyclists know that there is no water here, which is another feature of the scenery that affects the rider.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. The cyclist in Joe Kurmaskie's "Do not exceed posted speed limit" had many obstacles to overcome. When he showed his card to the old men for the first time, he probably thought to himself: "@ CAPS1 my God, what did I get myself into ? !" Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut, the old men told him he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later in the day. It was very hot and there was a lack of water, which made him fear that he would become dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by tiring him. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little price for all the determination and the efforts he made.

The setting where the cyclist is located is in a desert, and this can affect him because he could have heatstroke. The text says it lacks water and if you dehydrate too much it is not healthy and you die. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down, as well as the sweat. As long as she has some lijid left, she should be fine.

The setting for this story is a hot, dry desert in mid-June. These characteristics of the decor affect the author, because they show how he starts from strong + determined and his left weak + uncertain. At the beginning of the story, the author says, “Things started off pretty well. I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. It shows readers how confident he is in himself before he begins his journey. Later in the story, he describes the setting as "the high deserts of California in June". It describes the heat + what it is facing. He then recounts how he is dehydrated in a state of exhaustion. But he happens in a city, "cool water is pouring out of my head as I collapse against the wall." @ CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, so does the attitude of the authors.

Different characteristics of the setting affect a cyclist for example, the temperature really changes everything. If it's too hot, you will tire very easily. Again, if it's too cold, breathing becomes really difficult. The biker in the story was in a desert area in June so it was very hot and tiring. In addition, the terrain affects a cyclist. If the road is full of hills, it is difficult to climb those hills. If it's all downhill it's really easy, but all uphill is tough, flat terrain is pretty easy. The rider in the story was in flat terrain and then it turned into a lot of hills which made him tired. The characteristics of the frame really affect a rider

The setting has a great impact on the condition of the rider. First of all, it is very hot and dry in June. The cyclist winds his way through the “ high deserts at @ LOCATION1 ” where he encounters many hills that he must cross and descend. With all these obstacles and the heat slowing it down, it will need water but it is already low.

In the story "Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit", the narrator faces the difficult and perilous desert that must cross. He did not travel by car, he rode a bicycle and crossing a desert on foot is quite tiring alone on a bicycle. “ The speed limit was @ NUM1. I was doing a water depletion @ NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel. In the horrible heat of @ NUM3 degrees, the narrator swallows his water bottles at such a rate that he runs the risk of running out. Not only that, but he's been pedaling for so long that @ MOIS1 has passed out from exhaustion or, " I could have heatstroke on a beautiful day in June just because I listened to gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, so I would say the narrator was quite hassled by his surroundings.

The setting affected the character in a way that would generally affect people. When he got to the first town he had no more water to drink, but the water in the town he was in now tasted like battery acid, so it's not safe. to drink. As he began to walk out, the scenery changed. “Within two miles of this next section of the trip, I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road has been replaced by short, rolling hills. "This hints that this town he's going @ MONTH1 will be abandoned or unused. He saw a huge rattlesnake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of 'a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he said, “trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.” Eventually he got to the point where he had to put pebbles in his mouth to trick his mind that he was no longer thirsty.

The peculiarity of the frame affected the cyclist because at first he had to pay attention to the snakes that usually crossed the roads, then the streets were twisty and bumpy, so the road structure destabilized him a bit, and he was riding a bicycle. in June and it was very hot, and he was running out of water so he thought he was going to have heat stroke. These things affected the rider's performance on his bike.

The cyclist crosses the high deserts of California. In this environment, everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is difficult for the cyclist to keep morale up as he does not even pass through towns or water sources. The cyclist says "About forty miles in the pedal, I came to the first 'town'. This place may have been a prosperous little place at one point, say before the last world war, but that morning it met the traditional definition of a ghost town. This made the cyclist doubt the directions of the elders. In the great open desert, the cyclist did not encounter something until after at least twenty miles. The heat, the lack of water and the lack of civilization made the cyclist believe that he "was going to die and that the birds would pick him up cleanly." When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch factory, the cyclist says they have used up what appeared to be their last energy. Conditions affected the cyclist

The adjustment affects the rider by showing that he is a little angry. He states that " don't remember the saying don't take candy from strangers ." So we know he's upset about something. He's crazy about this older man telling him how to get somewhere, and he's wrong. Man understood this halfway through the story. He also said that "the old man hasn't come out of his porch since Carter took office," so he needs to update his instructions. So the beginning is a negative attitude.

In the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit", the settings affected the character because he thought he would not make it to the park because of the way things were around him. Because of the hills and the snakes, he didn't think he would get anywhere and thought he was going to die. This is how the setting affected the character.

As the cyclist tried to get to Yosemite National Park, he listened to old men who pointed out a shortcut. When he started his journey, everything was going well. the time he realized that old men were a mistake, he was almost out of water. There was nothing around that he could drink. He was very thirsty. its task is no easier. Halfway through his journey, he encountered rolling hills, which made his journey even more difficult. factory. It made it much harder to go without water and he looked at the picture of the boy drinking juice. In the end, he finally went to a pait shop where he drank all the water he could.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affected the rider. For example, when driving on the road, he would choose a destination and go there. Then he would take a break. If that destination were a building, he would have strong will and be determined. If it seemed like there was nothing in front of them but hills, he would just ride and wait until he fell dead regardless of the world.

A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that could not contain the most crappy mule greeted me. This sight was troubled. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck I would hit a lump and lodge one in my throat. Difficult road if he had not followed the advice of the old man, he would have enjoyed his bike ride, he needed a new map.

The characteristics of the story affect the cyclist by having nothing to drink. The person was traveling to a remote location without food or water for miles. He could have died. There is another characteristic of the effects on the rider, and that is that no one is there for miles. If he died there, no one would know for days. I know this because in the story he said, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. That says it all, the last peculiarity is that it was hot. I know this because it says, “ I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. It's hot in June, and it's even hotter in California.

People who travel will almost always encounter difficulties. For the main character of this story, therefore a very real one. His first mistake was when he took the instructions of the "old folks" in doing this, he traveled extremely far out of the way. In the story, he was talking to the old men on the porch. He said 'what I shouldn't do was let them see my card'. Another problem he faced was when he started to run out of water. This caused him a problem due to dehydration. In the story he said, "The water bottle contained a few mouthwatering sips." @ CAPS1, another problem he encountered was the desert area he was passing through. This caused him a problem as there was no one to help him if he needed it. In the story he says, "There was no one in sight, not a building, cars or structure of any kind. Reading this story we realized that people are having problems everywhere, however any problem, regardless of its size, can be overcome

In the story, the characteristics of the frame affect the cyclist is that when riding he has very little water. In addition, he takes advice from old men and he meets a snake @ CAPS1 and he goes down a dirt road where he has no water at that time. The conclusion is that it is coming from the dirt road and @ CAPS2 the main road it is traveling. He also promised to stick to it in @ CAPS3. This is how you should stick in the future.

The biker has many traits in his history. For example, he has descriptive words that put images in my head. For example "A long crippling hill", I can imagine it in my head. "There was no one in sight." All these parts of the story put images in my head. This is a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand this, and descriptive words to help.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. One of them is that the @ MONTH1 "hills" let the rider tire more. Another way is that of high heat water. And finally the path you take along the way and the number of stops you make along the way. The heat, lack of water, rolling hills and the advice you receive can have serious consequences affecting the outcome. A rider has to make a plan and show determination to get where he needs to go.

The frame of the story “Do not exceed the posted speed limit” reflects the cyclist. In the story, a cyclist rides a bicycle and takes the directions of a few old men. Later, he realizes that old people probably had no idea that things changed over time. He says " Never accept travel advice from a collection of elders who have not left their front porch since Carter took office." "(Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The cyclist takes the “shortcut” of the ancients and takes forever to reach his destination. At the end, he reaches his camp and another person asks him for directions. This time the cyclist says “ Yes, sir ! I have a very good map ”, and“ I will always stick to it in the future. " The message is the rider to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person @ MONTH1 lying or irresponsible.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider by making them dehydrated and hot.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider's mood throughout the test. Joe @ CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to be purposeful but helpless helping then to relief. Joe writes, “Things started off pretty well… flat roads…” This quote suggests that at first everything was fine. He started off with a "smile on his face". (@ NUM1) @ CAPS2, things are starting to change @ CAPS1 hits a changing pitch. He writes: “… I noticed that the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short hills. This quote indicates the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to continue, but he pushes himself towards the next "town". Finally, when the author reaches " Gary & Wilber's Fishing Camp ", he comes back to life when he sees an old man sitting down. The two men say, “Do you know the best way to get there? "Yes sir! I have a very good map. This reveals that Joe didn't ask for more directions, which was his first mistake. Also, frame changes can change the mood and attitude of one person.

The peculiarities of the decor affect the cyclist because it is in the desert that he is in summer. It affects the cyclist because he is riding a bicycle. For example in the story, he ran out of water. He starts to git dehyjradid.

The setting affected the rider because of the vibe and how each change happened. For example, when the setting changed, the rider felt different and it really affected them. As if the setting was sunny in a beautiful city then he would feel good, but if he was in a dark city he wouldn't feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.   

<START>

 

After some time in his trip he mentioned "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June". I believe that setting had determined him to keep pedaling so he could live. But then he started to think he might die, but he wasn't sad or upset, he was happy. He kind of made fun of himself, because he was in danger of dying because he had listened to old people. In my opinion, I think he spent the time of his life peddling in this part of California.    

<START>

 

Where the rider was gave him more disadvantages, then more advantages. The advantages were their hills to descend. Cons of hills to go up, water flowing when he is in the middle of nowhere, very hot outside, and is lost in the wilderness, does not have much hope until he sees factory. The biggest drawback is that he is by bicycle and not by car. He therefore has no @ CAPS1 and must pedal to continue. But being in the wilderness on a bike with no water, and you're the last one, that's bad enough. He was very lucky to have made it up the hill, otherwise he would have died there. And he thought he was seeing it right, he checked. I think for future car reference don't ride a bike in the desert, it's not too smart.        

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because when all the rider cares about is finding a place with water, all they do is fear and panic. In other words, when he looks around, the scenery he sees is like a desert and no building. The story says, “I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” when he sees he panics and thinks he won't make it, which affects him mentally.  

<START>

 

The characteristics of the scenery affect the rider in different ways. The woman who had listened to the older men to get to where she was going made her run out of water and almost died of thirst. As she walked to this place she saw a snake "At one point some weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake, it really looked like a diamond back" (@ NUM1). She started to see things that weren't there.  

<START>

 

It was affected by the lack of water, the hills, the snakes on the way and the condition of the road. The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. This quote explains how lack of water was a problem. The hills affected him because they were "crippling". The snake was on long paths on the road and didn't know how to get past it. Finally the roads were rough and you should go over the 55mph speed limit. So he was affected in different ways, not just one.

The characteristics of the arid desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also make him determined to escape them. It passes " ghost towns ", " abandoned buildings " and diamond-backed snakes. These are images traditionally associated with loss in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most people traveling alone. The author even remarks that sadists probably find his story pleasant. He often mentions the fear of "falling" dead, of being eaten by vultures, and at some point even wishing death on himself by choking, even joking. And yet, he was determined to live. Despite the odds against him, he moved on, even after losing "what (he) believed to be (his) wasted bursting energy." behind that are remarks on the wisdom of the elderly. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns it into a lesson he will surely follow: follow the map!

The cyclist is affected by the heat, the hills and the lack of people. For example, the cyclist was running low on water and had “large rings of dried sweat on his shirt”, and he could “fall from a heat stroke”. The hills must have forced him to use more energy, and finally the land of the people. If the cities were still crowded, the cyclist would not have been so affected by the surroundings.

The characteristics of any setting affect what and how you do it. The characteristics affect the rider through water, help and safety. “ I once read that sucking on stones helps quench thirst by allowing the saliva you have available to circulate. " This quote expresses his desperate need for water, saying it sucks a rock to drink his own pin. The rugged terrain and the abandoned road the old men sent him on which was obsolete, made him unable to ask his way and even know if he was traveling properly. Along the road, he meets a snake. Being so far from civilization, if he had been bitten, he would have no one to help him avoid getting dyed by the side of the road. In addition, if he should have heatstroke, he has no water or help. Safety, assistance and water are all factors that contribute to the features and their effect on the rider.

The characteristics of the setting make the race for the cyclist very difficult. He has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy. In addition, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry. This forces the author to need more water than he would normally have. The author said: “ ... I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. " The author knew that it was very dangerous to go there without water, he said" ... I could have heatstroke ... "If the surroundings had been cooler, there would not be as much. danger.

The features of the cyclist around him affected him negatively. He was cycling through “the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). His water bottle was draining slowly and the only city he had been to that had water had water that tasted like battery acid. Events looked pretty bad, until the speaker was delighted to see a factory @ ORGANIZATION1. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had "a shortbread picture of a young boy pouring a glass of refreshing juice into his mouth" (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The building has been abandoned. The speaker then states “ Somehow I got away from the abandoned juice and dream factory, slowly gaining altitude while losing hope ” (Kurmaskie @ NUM3). He lost hope after this landscape, and he practically gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.

The Cyclist in the Story Rugged Road Ahead Do not exceed the posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmashie, is strongly affected by the characteristics of the story setting. The first is the "shorecay" that is suggested to get to @ CAPS1, which naturally ends up separating it from all the other people and putting it in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water. His lack of water is the second thing that affects him as it despairs him and makes him feel like he's about to collapse and die. In the story, he says, "It really didn't matter.

Later in the story it is said, "I calmed down, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." This quote gives the reader information and tells us that the rider struggles to survive through the tough characteristics of the frame through the tough features of the frame. In the Californian deserts, I know from my knowledge that it is hot and dry, especially in summer. If you work outdoors, like the cyclist in this story, and you don't have water to drink, you will become dehydrated, which will ultimately lead to death.

"this view was lagging behind". The cyclist's advice gets worse when he reads for the next city. “ The flat road has been replaced by short, rolling hills. This part of his trip affects him the most. His environment and the characteristics of the terrain made him tired and thirsty. The frame has a major role for a cyclist.

In the essay “ Rough Road Ahead ; Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit "Joe Kurmaskie, the frame is integral to the way the bike feels and behaves. The cyclist feels a growing desperation as the scenery around him gradually darkens. At the start of the journey, the cyclist encounters a ghost town. "I laughed, checked my water supply and moved on." The rider is still thinking positively at this stage of the test. A little later, the cyclist comes across another set of abandoned buildings. He has the feeling that this spectacle is "disturbing". @ CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressed and pessimistic. Further down the road, the terrain of the road changes and he sees the sign that gives the test its name. “The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water exhaustion @ NUM1. Sometimes life can seem so cruel.” The rider's environment gradually deteriorates as he rides, but even in practice, he finds a place with working water. He is so delighted with this building that he wants to find the owners, and embrace them.

Some characteristics of the frame that affect the rider are that they cycle through the dessert. He says, "I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." So he was on fire selling a bike. The road has become bumpy and curry. A sign read “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit. The speed limit was @ NUM1 and he was going @ NUM2 so it must have been difficult to overcome all the bumps. The last time he met, a poisoned snake blocked most of the sidewalk in front of me. So getting dehydrated trying to run over a snake would be terrifying. So on his @ CAPS1, the setting doesn't help much.            

<START>

 

The rider encountered many issues while traveling to @ LOCATION1. They had to ignore many hardships such as lack of water, waste, the immense heat of the desert, as well as minor things like snakes and road conditions. The scenery of the Californian desert in June was the most intense test. That and the lack of water. Although the heat begins to invade the brains of cyclists making them see mirages etc. The heat and the overall scenery made the journey for cyclists much more difficult.

The setting affects the cyclist because in the scorching heat of California in June where no one wants to be outside. But first, it was the heat that took a lot of things away from him while trying to keep him cool. Then came the mailman of whom he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it says: "A tar-like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water smelling somewhere in. the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. " So now he's out of fresh water to drink when he says, “Within two miles of the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. Thus, the cyclist has very little water and does not have to endure the most difficult part of the journey. Then later he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loses consciousness. He also spoke of him possibly having heatstroke. Allude to the fact that the setting he was in affected him in different ways.

The setting for the “ Do not exceed the posted speed limit ” test is very dry, sandy, hot and deserted. On the way to Yosemite, he takes a " shortcut " to take me across the desert. When he first leaves, it's in a hot, flat part of the desert. Her mood is good and she has confidence in herself. “Things started off pretty well. I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. With this he gets to the first "city" but he doesn't worry about having plenty of water to keep going. The terrain begins to play against him in his search for water, “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills, a large highway sign has jumped over him. He said : Rough Road Ahead : do not exceed the posted speed limit. " This reduces self-confidence, especially because everything is desert and has heat stroke, no one would be there to find it. He maintains his resolve when he sees the factory but moves on. When he sees the first composition, he is overcome with relief and the ground flattens out again. When asked if he needs direction, he replied that he has his own map to be able to stay on the ground that he knows is the rest. He can keep his hopes to himself and follow a real set of directions.

Anyone who's ever ridden a bike knows how relaxing it can be, but when you're forced to ride miles and miles on @ CAPS3 terrain without water, relaxation feels like an oasis, @ CAPS1 through rough roads and dry all around you really put a domper on your experience, @ CAPS2 it extends your need for thirst by increasing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you have. The ability to block it all out and try to focus on something more manageable is exactly what you want to do in these situations, the @ CAPS3 terrain can really give a rider some character, but adding the fact that the amount of water he had and the drought around him, it looks like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I will never have to endure this kind of situation.

Cyclist Joe Kurmaskie struggled to get to Yosemite @ ORGANIZATION1'l Park. Granted, he was misled, but if the ground conditions and the climate worked for him, it would have made his life a lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one bottle of water. A water bottle @ MONTH1 lasted a bit longer if it was a direct hit, but it wasn't. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were ghost towns and cities as well. The only water he could pump from the pump was boiling and tasted sour. Plus, he wouldn't have lost so much energy if it was a straight shot. It's easy to tell that he literally roughed it up, having to resort to pebbles in his mouth to circulate the saliva. Overall, he was very determined to overcome the very unfortunate conditions he had against him, and very lucky to survive them.

The characteristics of the scenery affect the cyclist in several ways. For example, the fact that he cycles “through the high deserts of California in June, makes the intensity level of the story very high. If it had been @ DATE1 and there had been a nice breeze, it would be different. 

<START>

 

The characteristics of the frame affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the state of the pipe for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he could not do it without water he could pass out. he had no water. Another example of how the frame affected the rider would be the poisonous snake if he had been bitten he could have died as there would be no one to help him. And the final example of how the setting affected it would be the condition of the road as it makes it harder for the rider to get to his destination with hills and windy turns. This is how I think the frame affected the rider.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. One way is if it's hot and you ride for a long time, you need lots of water so you don't get dehydrated. It can also affect your vision because you are looking at the sun. Another way the rider can be affected by the tuning is if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape, it can affect the way they ride their bike.     

<START>

 

 The story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " by @ PERSON1 contained statements that we were somehow unnecessary to put. One of the sentences in the essay contained a word that does not need to be used. In the sentence, about forty miles from the pedal, I come to the first "town", I don't think "the pedal has to be there because it doesn't describe anything.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. One way is, the tuning. The cyclist is outside in the dessert, in the weather of two hundred degrees. With very little water. Also, the cyclist didn't have a map and he asked someone who hasn't left his porch since Carter was in power. "Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day just because I was listening to gentlemen who hadn't stepped out of their porch since. decades." This quote talks about how setting (@ NUM1 degree weather, dessert) can @ CAPS1 him. Plus, he was listening to someone who didn't know what he was talking about. In conclusion, this is how the characteristics of the tuning affected the rider.

The sets in the story are very desert like what I mean by that is the desert and it's hot and he really had to push himself to get there. The driving conditions are very difficult and have a lot of shape. Outside of the story, he gets a boost of energy and pedals as hard as he can down a hill, then relaxes. This is the setting and this is the summary of the story.  

<START>

 

The setting affected the rider as the state of his surroundings was hot, so he became more dehydrated and needed more water. There were a lot of hills so he had to pedal harder and use more energy to climb the hills. There were no cars, buildings, smog, just nature. It was a peaceful and relaxing ride on the bike the setting of which affects the rider.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location and population all have an effect on the rider. In the story it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate of California, in the heat of June. Their lack of water also, some must pace its sips with caution. So also few cities, making it difficult to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also encounters a snake, making it affected by native wildlife. The dry climate and the lack of water affect him with doubt. The rider is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The rider also has doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect on the dangers of its journey. All of these things in the frame affected the rider. However, his journey teaches you that, thanks to your determination, you will be rewarded. You have to want it bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude in order to be successful.

The features and settings affected the rider due to all the dangers of doing so. He took the advice of older people to do so. But even if everything started well, almost nothing lasts forever. It rolls like in midsummer with little water and in the desert. It runs into abandoned towns and the next town is only NUM1 miles away, it will literally be rough roads. But when he got to the city that was abandoned. Until he finds hope and sees a man in a chair

The characteristics of the frame affect the cyclist not being in the city. I say that because the cyclist talks about "old timers who haven't left the continents of their porches since Carter came to power."

In the route of cyclists to Yosemite, several factors prevent it from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to it by the elders. The second is that because the information was not true, the rider had insufficient water. It dehydrated him. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads and old ghost towns and abandoned buildings which made the rider less confident. These are the characteristics of the frame that affected the rider     

<START>

 

The setting affects the rider as they should have stacked it on their own map. He should have brought an extra bottle of water. @ NUM1 does not take any advice from people who have been on the porch in years.

The setting affects the mood of the cyclist in the story, the cyclist takes a shortcut with many abandoned towns and buildings as well as rough terrain. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump, he immediately started pumping it, the water was not safe to drink. He was determined to go to the next town. “I could do that,” he said. Because of the ghost town and the old pump, he had to keep going. When the cyclist came to a road sign warning him to be on the road, he started to get depressed, “ I was sad ”. Finally, when he reached @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 Fish Camp, he was grateful and wanted to show his gratitude. The tuning can affect a rider by their mood at first, the rider is determined, but as the tuning gets worse, their mood and hopes soar. In the end, when the setting is bright, so is her mood.

The characteristics of the frame affected riders as he was thirsty and hot and he was almost out of water and he almost died because when he was drinking water and he hit a bump and that 'a spit lodged in his throat and tired him seemed to never end.

The characteristics of the environment affect the cyclist as he was not prepared at first, the cyclist received instructions from an old man who had not left his porch for years so that he would not know what had changed. Then the cyclist begins his journey with little water. When he got to the second city, “I notice the terrain is changing. The flat road was replaced by short hills. This quote means he didn't expect hills, he thought it would be a flat path. Also in the @ NUM1 degree, whether with limited water supply, he could not go up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. This is how the rider was affected by the adjustment functions.       

<START>

 

Many factors have affected the rider. The temperature, the terrain, the directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature across the high deserts of California left the rider feeling hot, parched, and irritable. Throughout the story, he only had a few drops of water left. Knowing your lack of water "to feel sorry for himself" The cyclist had cycled so far, the terrain began to change from flat to "hills". This could have a huge impact on someone who has never ridden a bike on different levels before. Finally, the feeling of hope could have affected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. The mere fact of having followed the instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author has done a great job using hyperbole to exaggerate cyclists' sense of hopelessness. He also used very detailed text to paint a picture for the reader. These literary elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of temperature, terrain and hope on the biclist.

The characteristics of the frame really affect the rider. It is led to false pretenses by the immediate environment. Doesn't he know it would put him in danger? When he meets a rock on the road and finds that the water pumps are not working well, he is in serious danger. In the reading it is written: “The sun was starting to heat up, but he hardly noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. The setting left the rider's mind in awe of it so much that he didn't even notice the heat.

In the short story, "Do not exceed the posted speed limit", by Joe Kurmaskie, expresses the characteristics of the frame as the lack of water, and does not find help until the end which affects the cyclist in the story. During his time of need, the cyclist says: “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean, leaving only expensive outdoor gear and a newspaper with the last entry to congratulate the old men on their wisdom. The cyclist lacks necessities in the features that surround him and lets his pride fall; give up hope. When the rider regains hope, “ and I drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to look for Gary and Wilber, kiss them and buy some bait. " The cyclist was amazed that on which he had fallen and appreciated that it is still alive. The cyclist should not have taken the advice of the elders for granted, but will now look at people's sense of direction.

The setting affects a lot of things in the stories. The setting of this story affected the cyclist. The surroundings were very hot and that slowed him down a lot. For example he said he was doing 55 miles

The setting for the story was the "high deserts of California in June". At first, the rider seemed genuinely confident and excited about his trip. It was during this that he changed his mind. The rider was running out of water so he stops and pumps the water out of that water pump, but all he gets is that sour taste. So he's on his way to the nearest town, which is NUM1 miles away, and he thinks he can get there. So he's heading for the nearest town when the terrain begins to change. It goes from a flat road to short hills. During this time, the cyclist begins to lose hope. He thinks he's going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to tear him up. Then when he thought he couldn't do it, he saw a sign that said "Gary and @ CAPS1 fish camp". the men asked him if he needed help and he said no, I have a really good card. The high temperature and the hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he sees mirages and dies. It says in the story “ I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage ” and “ I was going to die and the birds would clean me up”.               

<START>

 

The characteristics of the cyclist's environment affect them very drastically. They need a supply of water and if they don't have one they can become dehydrated or even die. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from setting so strong on them. They should also ride a bicycle when it is not so hot outside so that in case the water level drops, there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help you if you get injured. There should be buildings nearby just in case of an emergency. It might even be good to carry a cell phone.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in more than one way. The first features were a dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and an enclosure that could not contain a single mule. These elements gave the cyclist a feeling of doubt. They made him start to think he had taken the wrong road when he saw that these things were out of date. Then he couldn't get cold, clean water from the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle that affected him. The next set of decor features that were problematic were the tumbleweeds and "a ridiculously large snake". They scared the cyclist and gave him a tour of these things. You can tell he was scared because he quoted "I calmed down". When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist's journey became exhausting, endless and difficult. Two other things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of panels. One said "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the posted speed limit" and the other said "GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want big bait, we're your BEST BET." The first sign affected him negatively and made him a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the bumpy road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the only thing that would make things better so it had a positive effect. These are characteristics that have had an effect on the rider.

The setting affected the rider: due to changes in terrain. A difficult place for the cyclist was when the terrain went from a flat stretch to hills. The author wrote: " I dug up " (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the hard and it was not an easy stretch to cross. Another place in the cyclist's journey that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory The narration states, "on a long crippling hill, a building appeared" (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). Contextual clues that provide information indicating that it was not easy are the words "long" and "crippling". @ CAPS1 of these words gives the feeling of being drugged in the difficult context of the cyclist's journey.

The cyclist had encountered difficult obstacles on his way to Yosemite. He had received directions from a group of old men who had not been to the places they had told him about for a long time. Where they said there would be a city, it was more of a ghost town. The day the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was driving through the desert @ CAPS1 made it worse. Due to the heat, he drank his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it quickly as the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open, he couldn't get any more water. The rider also had to ride on bad roads @ CAPS1 slowed him down even more. These characteristics of the decor greatly affected the cyclist during his trip.

The part of the cyclist's journey affected him because if he was an early desert in California. It affected him because he had to cycle through it and the heat took a long time. It didn't have much water as there were no rivers or water supply due to the desert surrounding it. In the end, he finds a store that affects him as he gets a cold drink and the same supplies that have helped him. So in the end his surroundings destroyed him and then relieved him.

The cyclist was on his way to Yosemite National Park and ran out of water on the way. "The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips." Then the hills came into play, making you more tired and thirsty. “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills.

In Joe Kurmaskie's “Don't exceed the posted speed limit” story, the frame really affected the rider. At the start, when the rider left in the morning, the conditions were excellent. It was windy with the shade of trees and rivers. Then after a few hours the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker says, “ Not two miles in this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The condition of the roads and the lack of water really affected the rider. It took more energy for him to move up and down hills without any shade, which meant he needed more water than he had. The condition of the frame really affects the rider and if it was easier to ride the bike, he might not have been so dehydrated.          

<START>

 

The frame characteristics affected the rider by disrupting them to ride on the road, limiting their speed, and making their distance longer than the original travel plane. For example, the features of the setting disturbed the rider to ride on the road because it told them where they could go and where they couldn't and they shouldn't do this or that like the "no entry" sign or " one way". Secondly, it limits their speed because if the characteristics of the setting indicate that the limited speed is @ NUM1, the rider can only ride about @ NUM1 and not go any further, which may give the rider more time to reach the limit. place he wants. go and could not travel faster. Third, it makes their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or the speed at which they can drive. Such as the sign “ Rough road ahead, do not exceed the posted speed limit ”. Therefore, the characteristics of the setting were assigned to the rider during the log.

In the test, the characteristics of the frame affect the rider. One characteristic that affects him is his lack of water: “The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when it came to the welch grape juice factory. The abandoned building years earlier had been a grape juice factory and a welch bottling plant. ” This desperation, after arriving at the abandoned factory, was followed by disappointment and a vague sense of Despair expressed by the phrase “ I bowed my head ” after he found the abandoned factory These are some of the characteristics of the frame that affect the rider.

No water, rough terran, bad information - all are reasons the boy isn't doing so well. I said no water because he is dehydrated but needs to drink his water. He could also die of thermal exauston. I also said rough terrain because he could fall and hurt himself without anyone to help him. And to top it off, he took information from older people who didn't know what they were talking about. Theas leave all examples on the essay that support my writing.

In the story of Joe Kurmaskie, he tells of a challenge of cyclists through the heated deserts of California in June. The cyclist left with confidence, then determination, then relief. The frame affected the rider both physically and mentally. First of all, listening to old people was stupid, then making the trip without being sure that you had enough water, and finally crossing the desert in June. He also started to doubt himself a bit, which won't help much in ensuring the trip's success. When he got to a fishing camp, an old man even older than the men who gave him the false information told him he knew how to get to Yosemite, but the young man did the best thing and gave him said he already knew how to get there. He didn't have to travel in the desert heat for hours, which is just plain unhealthy

A rider is affected by many things when riding, most of which are characteristics of the frame. One characteristic of the parameter that can have an effect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough, it may be more difficult for the rider to maintain control of the bicycle, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the test on page @ NUM1 titled : Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the speed limit, had a hard time on the roughest roads in part due to his level of experience. . Another aspect of the environment that can have an effect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who cycle ??? knowing everything about sport knowing how to dress to keep their body at a comfortable temperature, but sometimes the weather plays tricks on us . The cyclist could be caught in a sudden heat wave to bring the temperature down.

The characteristics of the decor accentuate the desperate spirit of the cyclist. Throughout the journey, the cyclist is alone and there are no people, cars or buildings around. It made him much more desperate because if he fell from dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would simply die. Also, he stumbled across things like “ Welch's Grape Juice Factory and Bottling Factory ” which gave him hope, but soon shattered him. These events made him much more desperate because he had no support out of nowhere and nothing to fall back on in a life and death situation.

In the test " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. First, as he drove about @ NUM1 miles down the road he saw the terrain changing and that scared him he said, “This sight was disturbing. I had knocked my water bottles quite regularly ”(kurmaskie @ NUM2). He says the more things around him started to change, the more he got scared. And he continued to drink a lot of water just to lower his fear. Another example is after he left the sign that told him not to pass. He says that " the flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills " (kurmaskie @ NUM3). It is also an example of fear that began to invade him, when he saw more changes. He was not going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost exhausted, he still had the courage to go further. The frame scared him but he succeeded.

In the story, the cyclist had run out of water. He had mentioned that it tasted like battery acid. The environment affected him by looking around and seeing no one for miles. It brings despair. Also a desert with the scorching sun beating down on it and just sand and catus all around. Now, if you saw that, you wouldn't think of any note water or shadow because the desert is pictured when you hear these descriptions.

The characteristics of the setting, in “Do not exceed the posted speed limit”, affect the rider. The setting affects him both physically and mentally. In the story, the frame does not provide water to the rider, which makes him weak. In the mental aspect, it is greatly affected by the characteristics of the frame. An example of this is when you see the abandoned welch factory and see a picture of a boy "pouring a glass of refreshing juice into his mouth". This is how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider.

I believe that the first photograph relates closely to the story "As a concern" because the author's son suffers a lot from it. And that shows what he and his @ MONTH1 friends look like. It also shows the surfboards with a focus there on the surfers. This is what I think of the first photo. The seconds are not closely related because it has a surfer surfer. So in conclusion, the first photo is more faithful to the story than the second photo.

When the cyclist was trying to find Yosemite, he stumbled across a million settings. One at first when he was talking to the old men on the porch and getting him away from nothing but dessert. "A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't contain the most crappy mule greeted me." There is only him. At one point, weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake - it really looked like a diamond blocking most of the sidewalk in front of me. Dry grass usually means the desert. He also saw the @ CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and the bait shop where he finally found someone else to give him instructions.

In the story, the rough road ahead, the more cyclist is affected by the frame in several ways. Because he was in a desert in June, it was very hot, so he was thirsty. Also because of the heat, he might have dehydration from heatstroke. Finally because it was a desert, wild animals like snakes and lizards could injure him or position him and he could die, so the setting of the story affected the cyclist.

The cyclist in " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " by @ PERSON1 suffers from certain difficulties while crossing the desert. The characteristics of the frame affected the cyclist by not having water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation which means that there is no water so he becomes dehydrated . In addition, the framework of the cities he visited did not have living organisms or people, so he could not quench his thirst there either. In one town there was a stake but the water was disgusting and hadn't been pumped for a while. Then he comes to the abandoned Welch's juice factory and from there he thought he was screwed but then he finally came to a store where there was a toilet where he drinks the water from the sink and is relieved. . In addition, the rocky roads affected him as he had hardly any water left and a rock tent to gain more strength and stamina.

In the passage DO NOT exceed the posted speed limit, the desert characteristic had no positive effect on the rider. The desert contained " rolling hills ". When a cyclist travels over hills, he needs more energy due to the laws of gravity. Because the cyclist used more energy to cross the hills, he only had it to “ feel sorry ” for himself. The more hills there were, the more energy he lost, the more he got tired. The desert was also hot and dry. Obviously, since he was in the "deserts of California in June". @ CAPS1 would make him thirsty. He stopped for water but a "tar-like substance" came out instead. When he stopped again later for water, it was "cool" and most likely refreshing. While cycling in the hilly, dry and hot desert, the cyclist became tired and thirsty.

The characteristics of the settings affect the rider by obstacles in the settings. An obstacle is an object in your path and you try to go there. Some obstacles in the story such as hills, forks on the road and also a rough road.

In the story " Do not exceed posted speed limit ", the setting affects the way the rider rides. In this story, the scenery is nowhere without water, and all it can see are roads. This affects the rider as he is hungry, thirsty, and now he is about to go down a very steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously making sure with no one around to get help from the frame out of nowhere affects the cyclist in this story.

The characteristics of the story tell me that it was in a very dry and sparsely populated area. He said there were hills in a desert in California and it was dry. I think these things affected the rider by dehydrating him. Going up and down hills can be very tiring, especially when you don't have much water left and you need to save some. The quote " I knocked my water bottles quite regularly and traveled to the high deserts of California in June " tells me a lot about the story. Going to a desert in California in June during the summer is a very brave and stupid thing to do. It is twice as hot in summer.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider by not having good instructions from the elders. In the text it is written: " Never accept travel advice from a collection of elders who have not left the confines of their porch since Carter was in the office ", this means the cyclist does had no good directions. Because maybe the road has changed and the elders don't know because they were sitting on the porches the whole time. That's why I think salling affects the rider.

In the test entitled " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ". This is a gentleman who rides his bike to " Yosemite " and he doesn't know exactly how to get there. So he stops and asks some old people and he says "Never take travel advice from a collection of elders who have not left the confines of their swineherds since Carter was in power." @ CAPS1 means they are not familiar with the changes. After leaving the old folks, he continues his long, scorching journey. He starts to run out of water and therefore begins to panic. Then he comes to the sign that says "Rough

In the essay “ Rough Road Ahead ; Do not exceed the posted speed limit ”, the setting characteristics had an effect on the rider. The frame and features affected him not only physically, but also mentally. The executive made him doubt himself and men and also it prevented him from having the energy to get to where he was going. The place the cyclist was riding in California affected him physically. It was hot and there was no water. It made him tired and frustrated. The setting also affected him emotionally. He started off well, but as he went on and the road slowly turned into hills, he started to get frustrated and angry that he had listened to the men. As he didn't see any buildings in sight for many miles, he began to lose his resolve as well as his hope. Finally, when he saw the sign “ Gary and @ CAPS1 Fish Camp ”, he started to regain hope and become less frustrated. The setting and characteristics of the test affected the rider not only physically, but also mentally. He started to be determined and then as the setting changed he became doubtful and frustrated. In the end, he turned out to be satisfied as the setting looked more promising.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. The text first mentions that "there was no one in sight, not a building, a car or a structure of any kind". This shows that the cyclist felt safe and was starting to upset him. Another example of the text that describes the cyclist is as follows : “ A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that could not contain the most crappy mule greeted me. " You can see through the cyclists he was frustrated that water is lame pumps. It could also have caused fear in the cyclist as he lacked water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like "battery acid" it wouldn't last any longer. In conclusion, the characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways.

In the test " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", many characteristics of the frame affect the rider during his journey. The rusty water pump, road sign, and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a "dilapidated shed" surrounded by "several rusty pumps and a corral which cannot contain the lame mule", he does not hesitate to check the pump for it. much needed water. When he finds that he's unlucky and can't drink the bitter-tasting water, his hope crumbles a bit. It's like the sun is laughing at him, telling him he can't do it. Second, he walks past a large road sign that says “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit ”. Once again, he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his anguish into determination to complete his journey. He says “ sometimes life can be so cruel ” when he notices the speed limit is @ NUM1, but he continues to pedal hard. Finally, the author sees an isolated building in the distance and hardly believes his eyes. Turns out it's not just his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflects on the irony of his position by saying that his situation "should appeal to all sadists" who read about it. Therefore, the characteristics of the frame affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn prompts him to keep pedaling.

In the “ Do not exceed the speed limit ” test, the characteristics of the frame affected the rider in several ways. One of the reasons it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and it was hot outside, his water did not stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreshing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn't know where to go. All he saw was a dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't contain the most lame mule greeted me. The sight was disturbing. Finally, this water pump wasn't working very well, so he got on all fours and started pumping. The water was not cooling. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. These are some of the features of the frame that affected the rider on his journey.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. First of all, the hills make it difficult to pedal on the terrain. “ The flat road has been replaced by short rolling hills ,” shows that the terrain was turning into a more difficult course. A long crippling hill, "also shows how the hills affected the rider. Another feature of the setting was the desert and high temperatures. This caused the rider to dehydrate." Trying to keep balance in my condition. dehydration "and" I could have heat stroke "show me how hot the cyclist was. A final feature that had an effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive. " I bowed my head " and " abandoned factory of juice and dreams " tell of how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building. All of the above of the scenery have negative effects on the cyclist.

The frame of the area where the cyclist was cycling affects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, he is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause major dehydration in a person. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says: “… but not before he picked up some stones and put them in my mouth. I had read once that sucking stones helps to forget thirst… ”This @ CAPS1 says that the cyclist puts stones in his mouth to stop thinking about his thirst. I think this @ CAPS1 explains exactly how dehydrated the rider actually was. If he was willing to put dirty pebbles in his mouth to help him get over his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that affected the cyclist's thirst was the difficulty with which he worked, which was also a feature of the frame as at the end of his trip he encountered rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat again more than he was. This made him @ NUM1 more dehydrated. This story explains how the characteristics of your environment can make or break you.

There are several characteristics of the frame that affect the rider, one is the fact that they are traveling on a hot June day. "and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful day in June." The heat was reaching the cyclist and he was afraid of heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a warm weather cyclist @ DATE1. “I noticed that the terrain was changing. The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The cyclist was tired and the hills made him worse. "The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips." The rider ran out of water quickly and there was nowhere near to get more. These glitches in the frame affected the rider as it was extremely hot, there was a lack of water and the terrain was rough. The frame was not in favor of the cyclist.

According to the test " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. One way that the characteristics of the frame affect the rider is that the mountains make the rider more tired. Mainly because he has no water, so having to go up and down hills really tires the rider and causes him to become dehydrated faster. The characteristics of the decor affected him in this sense. The snake also affected the cyclist. The snake scared the rider, which added to the rider becoming dehydrated. Another way the frame characteristics affected the rider was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The factory made the rider even thirstier and thought about dehydration even more in the "Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit" essay, the tuning characteristics affect the rider a lot.

The characteristics of the setting affect the cyclist because it is difficult for him to get to the “ national park @ CAPS1 ”. He took the advice of a few old men to take a shortcut to get him where he wanted to be. On his journey there, he stopped in a "town", which he considered to be a ghost town. Then he came to a Welch grape juice factory, but it was abandoned years earlier and he was getting weak and dehydrated. He thought he was going to have heat stroke. At the end of his ride, he reached a fishing camp where he found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, “Do you know the best way to get there? The man was much older than the other old men who gave advice to the cyclist. So the cyclist said to the man "yes, sir: I have a very good card". The man realized throughout his journey that he would never take the advice of the elders again.

In the " Do not exceed the posted speed limit " test, the setting affected the rider's sense of orientation. The cyclist knew where he was going and how to get there, but the old men told him their "shortcut". It ruined his own sense of direction because he was taking out of date instructions from "old folks who hadn't left their porch since Carter took office." This is how the frame affected the rider in L.

Steep mountains, rolling roads, jagged rocks - are all reasons why the setting is affected by the cyclist. Well the rider needs to know what's going on and what's going on @ MONTH1. For example “ Rough Rough : do not exceed the posted speed limit. " This parameter has brought about many changes. So yeah the tuning reveals a lot and I guess it describes how rider @ MONTH1 reacts to it as well. So yeah, I think the settings affect the rider through this whole thing.

What I believe the frame characteristics affect the rider is that "the old guys in history remember things like they were robots, like they say in the book, the world is fluid and things change all the time.

The characteristics of the frame affect the cyclist is that on his way he had to face so much. As with ex, he had problems with the flat roads which were replaced by short, rolling hills. The next thing was there was a sign that said he couldn't drive @ NUM1 he had to do @ NUM2 and that disappointed him. Then a large snake blocked most of the sidewalk in front of him. He became dehydrated. He became sad, desperate but still had the energy to feel.

There are several features of the tuning that greatly affect the rider. A characteristic is the desert which it crosses by bicycle. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising and lacking water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort than climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the rider has to work even harder to go up the slope. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike over on an uneven surface. Finally, there are no buildings in sight. When a person is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find it. However, if there is nothing they know about nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope, they won't put in as much effort to continue and they will lose some of their strength. Considering everything that negatively affects the rider, it is amazing that he managed to cross and reach a water source.

The staging of Joe Kurmaskie's short story " Rough Road ahead: do not past poster speed limit" is disturbing for the cyclist. worried him to be in the middle of nowhere. The quote “ Not two miles in this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain was changing, the flat road replaced with short rolling hills ,” shows that he was confused about having to go over the hills. As you can see, the setting has been very influential for the rider.

I testing the characteristics of the frame affect the rider by giving him hope. The cyclist takes the directions by some old men on a porch. The instructions seem incorrect at first glance. The remains of a grape juice factory give the impression that he will never find civilization.   

<START>

 

The characteristics of the environment around the cyclist affected him to the point of exhaustion and dehydration. The exhausted and dehydrated rider, or tired and thirsty, was starting to wear down as the frame went from flat to many ups and downs. The rider explained the change by saying, "The flat road has been replaced by short hills" (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). The idea of the cyclist presented here is that he had to find new challenges while climbing the hill of this roller coaster in the Californian desert. His water supply was dwindling from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond all reason. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water recharge and the shadow of a puffing cloud.

In the test " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the cyclist is affected by his environment. At first, the man starts on a reservoir campground. His confidence is high and he is ready to continue his adventure. As the day wore on and all he could find were abandoned buildings he began to worry about a little water flowing out he stumbled upon "a shed chained to a ram, several rusty pumps, "no sign of life. He realized that his trip was going to be difficult. The environment and the risk of death gave him the determination he needed to move forward. Although he feared he would die of dehydration, he knew that "crossing the high deserts of California in June" his only chance of survival was to continue. The human environment was what prompted him to continue cycling until he found the fishing camp. If he hadn't been so aware of his surroundings, he might have given up, but not stepping out of the desert into "the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite" would be devastating.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because they change the mood of the rider towards the rider. For example, in the essay “ Rough Road Ahead ; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit ", it says : " There was no one in sight, not a building, a car or a structure of any kind. could see on the horizon "The cyclist must have done this because he was having a hard time riding because he was thirsty and the ride was very boring. It makes the ride look long, which also makes it more difficult to ride. Also in the test it is stated, "A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps" This affected the rider because after seeing this and later realized that he could not drink the water, he was more thirsty because he lacked water. When the cyclist sees the Welch's grape juice factory, he is determined to go there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the test "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaskie, the mood of the cyclist towards the race is strongly affected by the characteristics of the frame.

Another feature that affected the rider was when he thought he could get water but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. This is said in. This is said in paragraph @ NUM2. This is how the characteristics of the frame affected the rider.

The characteristics of the scenery affected the rider because it was a conflict. It was a conflict because it was hot and he was lost. I was a confit that he was hot because he had a limited amount of water. He could get anything he could get because he was lost. The heat made people thirsty but he couldn't because he had limited water. Another conflict was that he was lost. It was a conflict because he needed to be somewhere.

There are many ways the rider is affected throughout the test by the frame. As he enters for the first time on the "short cut" given to him by old men, he is confident. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it's like a ghost town, he doesn't worry but continues his journey with confidence. As he reached the second stop, his lack of water began to set in: “I got on all fours, working the rusty water handle with all my might. This shows that he is going to work hard and that he needs water. As the cyclist passed another hopeless spot of water, he placed stones in his mouth because he heard once that it helped to forget thirst when he had pretty much given up hope of crossing @ CAPS1's hot desert without water, he found one lost driving in him when he saw a store with water. Although it is a hot and harsh environment, it inspired him to keep going, through the tough times, and to survive.

Rider in Rough Road Ahead: Not exceeding the posted speed limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people in the city anywhere. This void meant that there was no help from anyone and that he could die without anyone knowing. In addition, the setting appears to be very dry and to have desert conditions, without water the rider would be dehydrated and could suffer from heat stroke. In addition, the frame seems to be very hot. The heart also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally contemplates the logic of heat stroke at the time.

The characteristics of the frame had a strong impact on the cyclist. The heat, the animals and the terrain had slowed him down throughout his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn't have enough water to keep his body moving normally, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to squeeze around so that he wouldn't. don't bite it. The hills had affected the cyclist as it took a lot of energy to get up there, when he said he couldn't see anything in sight.

The barren, bare and rugged desert terrain affected the rider on his trip to Yosemite in the “ Rugged Road Ahead : Don't Exceed Posted Speed Limit ” story. The cyclist's expedition was hampered by many obstacles. Drought was a huge problem during his trip. “. I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). This explains the hot and arid climate of the place where he was cycling. This climate reduced the speed of movement that the cyclist intended to exert. Since the cyclist was riding in the desert, there weren't many towns present. When the cyclist approached a town, it was abandoned. "A dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold the crappy mule greeted me" (@ NUM2). After crossing the desert, the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest area, but all of them were ghost towns. "The flat road has been replaced by short hills" (@ NUM1). the hot desert with little water was not a sufficient challenge ; the flat land has been replaced by hills. The cyclist is exhausted by all the other obstacles the desert has confronted him ; the rugged terrain affected his trip as his pace was reduced. In conclusion, many factors negatively affected the cycling expedition to Yo Semite. The dry, bland, hilly terrain of the desert hampered his journey

I believe that setting an area can affect the mind when put in certain situations. In the reading, the man is riding a bicycle and he cannot see anyone, he is almost out of the water and cannot see a house or a person as far as the eye can see. It's scary and makes you feel helpless, but if he was at @ LOCATION1 and walked past cars, people on the street, and cars, he would be calmer, he could only get water. by building along his route the temperature would be cold over there he would drink less and go further. It would have changed his mood.

Well in the story don't exceed the speed limits posted by @ PERSON1 the setting affects you because if you can't see anything for miles and run out of water it has a sycological effect on you. You may start to panic like he did when he pulled over to the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. Also, you don't know exactly where you are which also affects you as you don't know where to go or whether to turn around or what. If I were that person, the traits around me would have a lot of effect on me.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. At the start of the test she was happy she got a shortcut "I followed their device and set off at dawn along a" shortcut "that was to cut hours off my commute to at Yosemite National Park. " He thought he knew where he was going," I laughed, checked my water supply and continued. " When she entered the first city," this show was disturbing. " I got on all fours, operating the handle of the rusty water pump with all my might, "she was starting to worry / running out of water, the next town was" only eighteen miles down the road “. now relaxed.” The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. " Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed, he was now upset and expected to die.

Many features of the frame affected the rider. One of the characteristics was the lack of water. This had made the cyclist dehydrated and was not thinking well. It also made the cyclist lose energy. An example is: " I calmed down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state ". The @ CAPS1 function is heat. The heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty. An example is " I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage ... " The example from @ CAPS1 is : " I knocked my water bottles fairly regularly and traveled the high deserts of California in June. .

In the test "Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the posted speed limit", many characteristics of the frame affected the rider. The first feature that affected the rider was the desert terrain, it was very hot and there were no trees to provide shade. This affected the rider as he was very hot and thirsty. So he drank more water than usual. Second, he lacked water because he drank more than usual, so he had to conserve his water, which made him dehydrated. That all the towns we passed through were ghost towns with no running fresh water so it was extremely disappointing to him, it also made him more dehydrated. Just as the cyclist was losing hope, he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finally had some water to drink. So after all these disappointments, he found hope in the little bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental impetus to continue his journey to Yosemite National Park.

The characteristics of the frame made the cyclist's journey even longer and more arduous. It didn't help that he was in such a remote area. For example, the people who still lived in this remote area were probably as old as the cycling grandparents and the directions were horrible. Also, the fact that there were no new stores or areas or rest for the cyclist; the water pump he found was old and dirty and the only building he saw was abandoned. Another factor was the rugged terrain. It crashes the cyclist was already very tired from the lack of water and the fatigue of the terrain was long, bumpy and just plain horrible all together. Finally the last factor was where he was biking in California on a summer day @ CAPS1 and he had no nc (but what bike) didn't help at all. Here's how the features affect the rider's ride.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because the rougher the terrain, the harder the rider had to work to do so. For example, when the terrain turned into hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills, which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the rider had less difficulty making the long trip. For example, if the cyclist was less stressed, he would not be as tired and drink as much water. In conclusion, this is how the characteristics of the frame affect the rider.

The setting affects the cyclist with the need and comfort to descend without infrastructure or people who are in the best friendly mood and colun no cars and just him and the beautiful sky with which to ride, as if there was an infrastructure that he must have to watch people, cars and just make signs and take action.

In the adventures of the cyclist, the frame is not only what develops character but it is what affects the way he pushes himself not to give up, even when he feels helpless. This is an example of how the cyclist is affected, "I had hit my water bottles quite regularly and was traveling through the high desert of California in June". With this information, you can observe how this difficult environment creates problems for him physically. because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and does not savor very well. These problems create the problem of dehydration, and when you mentally think you are going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control of yourself.

In Joe Kurmaskie's Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit, he is most often disappointed with the characteristics of the setting. You can tell he was disappointed with the features of the frame because every time he came to a city he couldn't get any water. In the text it is written: "I got on all fours while working the handle of the rusty water pump, a similar substance oozed out, followed by NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like acid. battery. " You know the setting disappoints. him when he sees the terrain he has to cross too. You can tell who he's saying, “At one point some tumbleweed crossed my path, a ridiculously big snake. The narrator was disappointed that he had listened to the Elder's instructions rather than using his card. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job facing a narrator and how he felt about them.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider because the route the rider was taking was a rough road that he had to take. The cyclist followed the bad advice of a few old men who had not left their porch for decades. also as he started his long journey he started to notice that the advice the old men gave him was bad advice the rider was heading to yosemite and he got advice from ???

When the rider first rode he was fine, he had plenty of water. As he continued, and somehow got a reason, he began to enter the desert region. It was hot and there was a lack of water. It made him dehydrated. Plus, seeing the weeds and the lack of vegetation probably made him mentally even worse, because he maybe thought he would never get out of it. When he saw the fish store he was probably relieved to be saved,

There are many ways a rider can be affected and one of them is the frame. The tuning affects them because if it is short, smooth tuning will be easy. But if it is long bumpy and bumpy roads, it will be more difficult to control the bike, which means that the rider's job will be more difficult. This is how a cyclist is affected by his settings.  

<START>

 

The cyclist encountered difficulties on the way to the park @ ORGANIZATION1. The first is the city he came to was a ghost town. Then he ran out of water when he ran past tumbleweed and a large snake in front of him. He was out of water and there were rough roads in front of him and he ran into a juice factory. There was no one there and he had no more water, he didn't know how long it would last until he got to another town. This is why I say that how the characteristics of the frame affected the rider.

The characteristics of the frame have a very negative effect on the rider. According to the old men, the cyclist would pass through a few towns if he took the route that had been indicated to him. But every town the cyclist went to was deserted. "There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." Because the towns were deserted, the water supply for cyclists was dwindling as there was nowhere for them to get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. "Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state." He once found some pebbles and thought about sucking them off as it helps slow down dehydration. But he didn't because he thought he was going to choke on them. The setting around him also made him think negative thoughts. “It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean. Because the setting was a hot, deserted wasteland, it had a very negative effect on the rider. If he hadn't run out of water, I don't think the decor would have been so bad. But because he lacked water, the effects were much worse.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. One of the reasons I say this is because he has run out of water and could become dehydrated. The search for water also slowed him down further. Another reason I say this is because the man gave him the wrong directions which got him confused and confused. This is how the setting affected the rider.

It is said that " experience is a good substitute for instinct @ CAPS1 ". This means that if someone knows how to deal with the environment they find themselves in, they can survive even if they were not born with the animal instinct that accompanies the territory.However, even the most experienced person can. be overwhelmed by extreme weather conditions. in which they live. In Joe Kurmaskie's “ Rough Road Ahead ” essay, the experienced cyclist decides to make a long, difficult and dangerous journey. His ride will take him through the long desert roads of California with a limited water supply. It is the major element that he and him in the story. Because he listened to the same old men, he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant exercises, the extreme heat and lack of water, dehydration hit him quickly. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist was familiar with. It says in the essay : "I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage." This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and has shown that he has adapted to his environment through experience. A story similar to this is that of jack @ LOCATION2, "TO @ CAPS2 a fire" where man is also opposed to the extremes of nature through the vukor, but the elements have always passed him. Both stories represent man's quest for adventure, as well as the bitter struggle for survival that people face.

The features of the setting affect the rider the most in how much they strain it in a hydrated state. This made it unable to operate at its full power / efficiency. It robbed him of the little energy he had in him at the start. This is how the frame affected him.

The setting strongly affects the rider. The desert and the heat without water cause it to become dehydrated. Hills and rugged terrain tire him. In the story it is written "and a growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful day in June". This shows that the heat and the terrain could cause him to overheat and experience heat stroke.    

<START>

 

The temperature in the area crossed by the cyclist affected him greatly. The temperature made the cyclist sweat. It affected him because he was thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example, in the text, he says “ the water bottle only contained a few mouthwatering sips ”, then he adds : “ I could fall from heatstroke ”. It showed how it affected him because he thought he was going to fall from the heat.

The features of the settlement affected the cyclist were the harsh and hot climate and terrain. The author clearly wrote how "the sun hit him and how he almost died of dehydration."

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. If the road is rough, you need to have the right bike. Then, if you have a flat tire, you need to know how to watch out for dangerous and posal things. If you were in a very serious accident, you should be prepared in case they don't find you on time. You would have to know what the nights were like. For example, if it is very cold at night, you need to keep yourself warm.

The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot and going up those hills must have been difficult. The road was also very rough. He says, “ Rough Road Ahead ; Do not exceed the posted speed limit. It is also written: “ I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June ”. The cyclist was very thirsty due to the hot weather. I think the frame had a huge effect on the rider.

The cyclist's condition was greatly influenced by his surroundings as he got lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat paralyzed him or he traveled in search of Yosemite. He got lost and ran out of water, which made his situation worse. Apparently lost in the middle of nowhere in the scorching heat, he became exhausted, dehydrated, and fearful of heat stroke and loss of consciousness. This is shown by the essay "The Rising Awareness That Could Fall From Heatstroke" and, "It looked like I was going to lose brevity for the last time.    

<START>

 

The way the frame characteristics affected the rider in the story, " Do not exceed the posted limit ", was very dangerous to his life. The cyclist was heading to Yosemite National Park on a hot @ DATE1. The cyclist rode his bike for miles through deserted towns, "This place could have been a small, prosperous place ... a ghost town." The terrain was threatening because after about twenty-two miles the cyclist had to cross "small rolling hills", which would consume more energy and make his thirst for water even stronger. The rider was out of water and the hot day was not helping. After a grueling trip, the cyclist used all of his strength to get to a local bait shop and drank from the sink after the dangerous environment he was exposed to. The story's set features, " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ," put the cyclist's life in danger and almost killed the cyclist, due to the lack of water and the terrain he overcame.

The features of the scenery affect the cyclist by teasing him. It was first the lapping of the streams that taunted his thirst, then the old tap and finally the welches grape factory. The strraing was the first step simply causing thirst, then came the tap. The tap made him realize that he was dehydrated. And finally, the abandoned welches grape juice factory almost made him lose hope. The setting affected his mood.

The characteristics of the decor affect the cyclist in the story. In the story it says, “The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. I could have heatstroke. This statement made it clear that where the cyclist was riding, water was very difficult to find and scare away. He talks about how he will die if he has no water. Another example is that there are no buildings around and it is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads. In the story it is said that “the flat road that changed terrain was replaced by short rolling hills. This means that he was partially on his own and had no one to turn to.

In this story, the characteristics of the frame strongly affect the rider. Some features show that this “trip” to Yosemite National Park was appalling, but at the same time enjoyable. "I would come along for this breeze getaway." The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding a bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the frame is very old and dirty. The water the cyclist drinks dries out his mouth even more. "A tar-like substance oozed out followed by a brackish water sensation." This shows the dirt of the water. In addition, this setting shows that the rider had to use everything he had to survive. It is written " working the handle of the rusty water pump with all my might ". @ CAPS1, the characteristics depict the sacrifice and courage of the cyclist.

In the test " Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the parameter greatly affects the rider. The setting around the rider caused her to drink a lot of water due to the dry conditions. “I was roaming the deserts of California in June.” This shows that she was most likely hot, sweaty and that a water source was not near her. The rugged terrain also caused her to use her own strength to move up and down hills and to obtain plants and animals. The settings of the story caused the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak, she was forced to have low water intake and avoid many dangers, with no signs of living people near her . “This place could have been a prosperous little place at one point, say, before the last world was.” This suggests a ghost town, where no one was currently living. There was no one around her to help her. The framework led to the deterioration of his health. His physical health was in danger due to his dehydration and lack of energy. His mind was also starting to worry. She shook her head to make sure what she was seeing in part of the story.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider. Because the man didn't have much water and had gone to the California deserts in June. Another reason is that the flat road turned into hills and there was a sign that read “ Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit ”. the speed limit was @ NUM1. One more thing is to make sure you don't listen to a gentleman who is old and hasn't been out of his porch for decades. These are some of the things that can affect the rider.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as it affects their condition. She needs water to survive, and the next town is far away. So she could eventually pass out without a brake, and the temperatures hot. “ When I tried a drape it tasted like battery acid ” (Kurmaskie @ NUM1). If it does not find water quickly, it will affect the condition of the plant. In addition, the characteristics of the frame affect its determination. When she knows she has to find a city. she works harder. "I would keep my water inside for at least an hour or my inner spirit" (@ NUM1). She would do her best to make smart moves and get to town as quickly as possible. She works more because she knows that without water her life is in danger. Now things could get even more difficult.

During Joe Kurmaskie's " Rough Road Ahead " cycle route, it undergoes setting changes such as the road being flat and then going over short hills. When he writes, he says the road is flat. “The flat road has been replaced.” This tells us that the road he was on was nice and flat. Then, as he was driving, he noticed the change in terrain. The flat road was replaced by short hills. this tells us that the cyclist will have a harder time seeing the terrain change. This is how the land changes

He sees a place full of water, but to get it you have to pump it. So he starts pumping and sees black gunk. It pumps about @ NUM1 to cool the water, but it does not cool. Come and find out that water tastes like battery acid. So he starts rolling again. but meets a snake. Luckily he is doing it, but he feels he is on the verge of death and regrets having listened to men who have not come out of their porch since @ PERSON1 was president. What angers him even more is that they seemed so sure. While driving, he sees a juice factory and goes there. Now it's a fishing store and we drink a lot, a lot of water.

As the author of the story continues on his bike journey, the landscape around him becomes less and less welcoming. The first thing the cyclist encounters is a rusty pump and an old shed. When the rider tries to get water from the pump, she describes the water as very hot and not cooling at all. As the cyclist continues, weeds that look like “diamond-headed snakes” cross their path. She does not meet any building for a long time when she meets a building it is abandoned and suggests that people have left because of the scenery. The cyclist meets another elderly man on his journey, but decides not to take his advice because of the path made by the last group of elderly men.

The characteristics of the surrounding environment affect the rider from his performance, for example, in the test " Rough Road Ahead." Do not exceed the posted speed limit, ”the frame is full of hills, twisting, uphill and downhill. All of these things go against the energy the rider has. In addition, the lack of population in the cities gives the cyclist a difficult and depriving time to find a water supply so that he does not become dehydrated. Third, the weather in the test has a lot of impact on the rider, it is hot in the California desert and the rider needs to be very hydrated to continue their bike ride.

In the essay "Rough Road Ahead: Staying Within The Posted Speed Limit", a cyclist is confronted with a disturbing setting on his journey to Yosemite. He is removed from the regular road as a result of following the wrong advice of an old group of individuals. In this test, the frame plays a crucial impact on the rider. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as " a journey through the high deserts of California in June ". Due to the amount of heat the cyclist was putting up with, he got tired and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed : " The flat road was replaced by short rolling hills ". This setting is a major setback for the rider's course, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been many obstacles that I have had to overcome. One of them happened when I was camping, and suddenly, like in the test, the setting changed and a storm came. Although the other campers and I did what it took to make the most of it. In the test, the rider is greatly affected by the frame. It was the same in my experience because the setting affected me.

The characteristic of the frame affects the rider because the environment is so negative. Everything around the rider is viewed negatively, so the rider naturally feels that the task is harder and harder than it actually is. For example, nothing surrounds the rider but sand and hot weather since the frame is so empty and no one is around, then everything feels harder than it actually is. In addition, the cyclist feels that he cannot continue and that he is weak because there is no life around him. Also, if the cyclist was in the park with the sun shining and people around and in sight, their attitude would change and everything would look easier.

In the passage "Do not exceed the posted speed limit", many characteristics of the frame affected the rider. One feature that affected the rider was the snake he encountered on his way, for example in the text it says "At one point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake", dehydrated state " This proves that the snake was a characteristic that affected the cyclist giving him a point to stay calm even in the state he was dehydrated and all the effects he suffered from it.

There are a lot of things that could have made his bike ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasn't in the middle of nowhere and if he actually knew where he was. For example, “ There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. " There he had almost no water for a day. For example, “ the water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. " @ CAPS1, he didn't know where he was going so it was more difficult for him.

In the short story " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ", the settings of the story affect the rider. They make him think that he is going to die and especially worry him. In the story, the cyclist follows the advice of two old men on the best way to get to Mount Yosemite and finds himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the Californian desert without water, he lets it go to his head. "I was going to die and the birds would pick me up clean." This line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unknown road and he let himself believe he was going to die. He knew he was in the desert without water, which made him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldn't have been so nervous if he had been in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince him that he is going to die. When encountering ghost towns he thinks he will never see anyone again, he becomes oledrar because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him. The executive affects and cheats on him into believing that he is going to die.

The characteristic of the setting, including conditions, weather and amount of water, can eventually decide the life or death of the rider. Conditions such as hills and rocky roads can decimate a future for a cyclist, because if rocky roads throw you off balance you could fall off a hill and get injured or even die. For example, in the short story it is written, “ On a long crippling hill, a building appeared. This shows the conditions the cyclist had to face. In addition, the weather and the amount of water can also decide the future. “The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips. Large rings of sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke. " This shows us that if the cyclist is sufficiently dehydrated, it could vanish and no one would find in the desert. Also, the heat doesn't help him once he might die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us that a cyclist must make sure that he has enough water and that the conditions and the weather are right not to make a choice that puts his life in danger.

In Joe Kurmaskie's “ Rough Road Ahead ” test, the rider underwent many changes due to the setting of his surroundings. The cyclist got lost in the dessert. It affected him a lot because the desert is very hot. He could have died of dehydration or exhaustion. Also, in the desert some animals can be very dangerous on the bike ride, he saw a poisonous snake. It was a good thing that he was careful with the snake because if he hadn't been, he could have been bitten and there would be no one to help him. The desert he was in was also dessert and there was no one to help him with directions. The worst would be if he ran out of water. Without water, he could become very weak and dehydrated. and could even have died. The setting of the cyclist's location affected him greatly.

In Joe Kurmaskie's short story "Don't exceed the speed limit", the frame has a big impact on the rider. At the beginning of the story, he describes the landscape as "@ CAPS1". As he continued to follow the old man's outdated advice. This led him through more arid lands. When he got to the first "town" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was "A romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't contain any music." Grape juice factory and bottling plant. It impacted his self-confidence as he said “I bowed my head,” he left and had finally come to an abandoned building called “@ PERSON2 and the Wilbers Fish Camp.” It's there. that he drank water and restocked himself.

One of the main things that affects cyclists is the heat. Due to the heat, he drinks all of his water. Another feature of the setting that affects the rider is the rough road because he is so tired that he finds it difficult to ride over hills and other difficult road conditions.

In the story “ Do not exceed posted speed limit ”, written by @ CAPS1, the setting reflects how the rider feels. For example, “ flat roads were replaced by short equestrian hills ” @ CAPS2 as the terrain changed, as did his attitude. When he started the journey he was happy and carefree and the land had no hills and it was flat. However, once he notices that all is not what the men said he seems to get a little angry and upset, @ CAPS2 as if the earth seemed to reflect him he quickly found himself on a bumpy and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on the adventure. The earth seemed to praise and torment him, when he began to realize that listening to old people was a mistake.

In the story "Do not exceed the posted speed limit" by Joe Kurmaskie, the characteristics of the frame affect the cyclist by draining him of his energy, he sweats so much, he continues to drink his water and finishes it slowly and still has a long drive past him. "The water bottles only contained a few mouthwatering sips." (Kurmaskie's) because it was so hot the cyclist was thirsty and drank all of his water. It was a hot day and he needed to stay hydrated.

In this story, the cycle was affected the most physically and emotionally in several ways. One of those ways was the frame around him. For example, when he entered the first city, he gained confidence because he believed he was on the right track for Yosemite. Then when the rider rode over that old shed and the rusty water pumps, he started to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes, I think he started to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe it because in the text it says "I was going to die and the birds would pick me up dead". It shows how desperate the man felt. when he reached "Gary's fish camp and @ CAPS1" he was relieved and grateful that he no longer had death blazing towards him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces and dots. 'an empty water bottle. This is how the features and setting affect it in many ways.

Cross beastly mountains, hot and scorching deserts and no water. A cyclist was passing through a town and asked for directions. The two old men gave him the wrong directions and sent him on a journey through hell that only a determined person could go through. He first had to walk for miles without water, which caused him to lose faith, become dehydrated and not pursue his plans. The terrain he had to cross was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determination, so he got away with it and learned of an injury. The maps are designed to be used by people so if you have a map you have to trust it and in the end it shows the rider learned it because he said " And I promised myself to that time that I would always stick to in the future.

All the characteristics of the environment in which the cyclist circulates greatly affect him. Firstly, since he crosses the desert in June, that means it is very hot and he will need a lot of water for his long bike ride. In addition, the ground on which it rolls is rough, which makes it lose energy. The sun was also starting to heat up on him, which meant he was going to take a hot spin towards the city and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the rider. This causes it to become dehydrated and need water. In the story it says, "The water bottle only contained a few mouthwatering sips" and that it could fall from heatstroke on a beautiful June day, it basically shows that the hot environment l 'gave him plenty of water to drink, and now he's low on energy, which could cause heatstroke.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider. At first it was a flat road that the speaker was happy with and he had "a smile". (@ NUM1). Then came some big hills which created a challenge, the rider had to muster enough energy to keep going. The rough terrain then forced the cyclist to work even harder to ride a bike. As if the rough terrain weren't absorbing enough, a snake blocked most of the sidewalks and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain, the harder on the rider.

The characteristics of the tuning affect the rider because depending on how the tuning is, this is the skill he needs. As if they were going down a hill, they really only needed to know how to control the bike. If they're going up a mountain with a lot of bumps, they must have some skill. Usually, if they ride in a shaded area, they wear clothes to keep them cool. But if they are going to be in the sun, they should wear light clothes. The setting affects the rider a lot.

The setting in “Do not exceed posted speed limit affects the rider in several ways. The old men told the cyclist that there were flat roads on the path he had to take, when the cyclist got there there were hills and not flat roads. The cyclist crossed the desert to reach his destination. He started to run out of water because it was very hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could keep his balance very well. In this story, the cyclist had to pass a big snake "a ridiculously big snake" - it really didn't look like a diamond back - was blocking most of the sidewalk in front of me "(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the rider had to do their best to pass it while teetering with dehydration.The settings in this story affected the rider in several ways.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider for many readers after another. @ CAPS1 are some examples where the cyclist was going down a windy road on a bicycle. He's in a hot desert-like place. It is very hot there and affects him during his travels. "I went smoothly, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because it" Rough Road Ahead "is the last example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake coming out of the tumbleweeds." A big snake, he really looked like a diamond back. ”@ CAPS1 are three examples of how the rider was affected due to the setting of the story.

In the story, the characteristics of the scenery affect the cyclist in several ways. For example, it is in the desert and it is very hot outside. In addition, it lacks water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated. Another example is when he comes across the building he first thinks it's a mirage because he's pretty much dehydrated. The rough terrain also makes it difficult to pedal and it is already weak from lack of water. In conclusion, all of these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in one way or another.

The characteristics of the frame affect the mood of the cyclist towards the trip. At first, he is convinced that the knowledge of the ancients on the earth is correct and he is excited about what awaits him. However, his excitement quickly turned to dismay and slight doubt as his journey dragged on. The heat of the weather and the lack of water make the cyclist develop a carefree material. " I had read once that sucking stones helps… hopefully I would hit a lump and lodge one in my throat." " Verbal irony of this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist does not care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is the best.

In the new " Do not @ CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit " Joe Kurmaskie, part of history affects the cyclist in several ways. In history, the cyclist undergoes many changes in temperature and climate. It also undergoes changes in the terrain structure, making it extremely difficult to pedal and get to where it needs to be. From my reasoning, this is why the @ MONTH1 parameter affects the rider.

The scorching sun and the features of the desert in the background affect the rider in a way that could potentially prevent them from reaching their destination. The sun is beating down on him and making it more difficult for him to reach his destination. "The sun was starting to hit ... large rings of dried sweat circled my shirt." Since he was so hot and so tired from the sun, he thought he would die of dehydration. This would most likely prevent him from making it to his destination, Yosemite. His lack of water supply also didn't help the situation as he could only go to @ NUM1, was " draining water @ NUM2 ".

The characteristics of the setting do not affect the rider. For example, if it is hot outside, he will need more water than usual. Also, if it was raining, he would have to drive more carefully. This is why the setting would affect the rider.

The environment around people in certain situations can affect them in several ways. For example, if you are hot, the tree may be in the shade, or it is thirsty, a nearby river might help make you thirsty. If you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you, it might make you hot. In this case of a cyclist, the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads to "ghost towns and trees." For example, he said: " The sun was starting to hit, but I noticed the barley noticed it ", it is because of the " fresh pines " around him, as he explains in the next paragraph. It is also said in the text that the terrain changed and he even came across a snake which added to his thirst. So what makes it harder for him to make one.

The stronger frame characteristics affect the cyclist's trip to Yosemite. The characteristics of the land, the hills, the fact that it is desert, and the setting in mid-June also affect this story. Dry land and hills are a huge factor for the main character. Because if it's hilly, it has to work twice as hard. The land is dry, so he is thirsty and has nowhere to find something to drink. The land is also desert, so there is no place he can go for help or get food, water or civilization. He believes he won't be able to. The text explains in paragraph !!, "the growing awareness that I could fall from heatstroke on a June day, simply because I was listening to gentlemen who had not stepped out of their porch for decades, made me laugh "a huge part in the story.

The framework of a situation can affect a person both mentally and physically. This is evident in @ PERSON1 " Do not exceed the posted speed limit ". The cyclist is unaffected, for the most part until instructions given to him by "a collection of elders who have not left the confines of their porches since Carter was in power." takes him to terrain that is not suitable for cycling. Before following the men's instructions the frame was nice and designed for easy riding, a reader knows this because the rider is confident. For example, he says, “The sun was starting to beat, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. This confidence begins to wear off as cycling becomes more difficult. For example, the cyclist says " sometimes life can seem so cruel ". after hitting hills and a sign warning of a rough road and not exceeding the speed limit. The rider became disappointed and wanted to give up because he couldn't even reach that limit. However, he is determined and pushes to reach a store.

The way the frame changes the rider's mood is that what they see pretty much describes how they feel. As if he started off with a softer smile and a smile on his face. Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town, it didn't really cool his morale because when he saw it he laughed. So when the frame changes, so does his confidence in the leadership of the old men. As in the first city, he always trusts what he has been told. Then he notices that it is starting to get warmer but that doesn't change his mood much. @ NUM1 miles later he gets to the top of a fork with rusty water pumps and a broken down car all making him less confident in the water level. Then he realizes that the next town is far away, so he loses more self-confidence and worries more about the water. Then the flat road is replaced with a rough road so that his mood deteriorates further. Then, finally, he goes to a fishing store and he takes water and his morale improves.

The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot environments that surround him. A characteristic is something specific about something else. In 'Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed the posted speed limit, the cyclist follows the advice of some old men who seem a little overwhelmed and gets lost because he lacks water and energy. The cyclist says: “On a long, overwhelming hill, a building appeared. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage ”(Kurmaskie @ NUM1). He was very affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Plus, the altered terrain affected the amount of water he drank and the difficulty he had worked with just to climb that long hill. The dry climate and rugged terrain greatly affected the rider.

Heat, dessert, humidity, so many things that affect the cyclist as on his journey. First of all, heat because the heat makes him thirst for water @ CAPS1 on which he runs. For example, the narrator describes: “ ... the water bottles only had a few mouthwatering sips. " This means that the day is warm and lack of water. Second, the dessert because the narrator is the only one around and the desserts are usually served. For example, the narrator exclaims, “ There was no one in sight, not a building, a car, a structure of any kind. " @ CAPS1 clear that it could be in a desert where no one wants to be. Finally, humidity, because it can be hot but then humidity kicks in and makes the sky drier and hotter than it usually is.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect this rider. At first he rides well on the old ' shortcut ' as he states that " things started off pretty well." I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. But what he didn't know was that it was the start of a very difficult day. He came to the first "town" which was a ghost town. He wasn't too worried yet, but about sixty miles into his journey he came to a dilapidated shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken corral. The cyclist explains that he had drunk a lot of water and that he needed it. He tried the pumps, but he explains how "a very similar substance went out, followed by a sensation of brackish water around two hundred degrees." A few kilometers later he came to a road sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD : DO NOT EXCEED THE SPEED LIMIT DISPLAYED. The cyclist desperately continued to have water. He even came across a snake. He now feared heatstroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and bowed his head. The cyclist was then almost completely dehydrated from the long and tiring bicycle race. The rider was sure he was going to die of dehydration or heat stroke that this terrible race had caused. He finally came to a store and drank from the sink. So this ride was tortuous due to the setting.

The characteristics of the frame affected the rider both positively and negatively. At the beginning, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the outdated information. They affected him negatively because without them the cyclist would never have got lost. When the rider got to the first town, the water pump affected him, the rider ran out of water, and the water in the water pump tasted like battery acid and was around @ NUM1 ° . The rider was getting more and more dehydrated and the small rolling hills did not help his dehydration, he was also using a lot of energy to get over the hills. Eventually he found Gary and Wilber's fishing camp where he could get some water. All this experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even if, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist has learned not to take the advice of very old people who "haven't left the confines of their front porches since Carter came to power." The cyclist was positively and negatively affected by the characteristics of the environment.

In the “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” test, the rider drives to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a faster route. When questioning the elders, he replies, " Never accept travel advice from a collection of elders who have not left the confines of their front porch since Carter came to power." " In addition to using their advice, he faces abandoned ghost towns, which they were prosperous places. The cyclist overcomes rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a June day in California in the deserts. Finally, he sees a bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the rest, he looks at them all. Based on the quote, you can deduce that the rider will ignore his advice to get the best card.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. One of them is only brought to transport as much equipment as @ MONTH1 will be needed. For example, you can only take a certain amount of water with you and once you run out of it, there are no more buildings or anything around you and you have no luck. In addition, you can only take a limited amount of food. Finally, when you're ready to fall asleep you can't just stop, you have to ride until you find a hotel or get home. I know I couldn't do it.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider making them dehydrated, confused and relieved. The cyclist is dehydrated from the horrible heat.

The cyclist is embarrassed by the scarcity of the surroundings. "a corral that couldn't contain the most lame mule." He is worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to ring wrong. The cyclist is relieved by the water in the sink. He had "the irresistible urge to look for Gary and Wilber, to kiss them". That means he's so relieved to have finally found some water, and he wants to thank the owners of the bait shop for providing it.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider in Joe Kurmaskie's “ Rough Road Ahead ” story. The downhill format helped him in a way as he wouldn't have to use his strength and pedal so hard without having so much water in his body. When it got to a pump, it was rusty with oozing tar followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid. The dryness of the dessert took a toll on the rider as he couldn't get to the Yosemite water until the end. The breeze from the wind had a positive effect as it helped him cool off.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. One solution could be that if the frame was, for example, in an area with a lot of water, the rider would not have to worry about dehydration.

The characteristics of the frame physically affect the rider. The lack of the California desert causes the cyclist to become tired and dehydrated.

Part of the scenery that affects it is the sun, which mercilessly overheats the biker. Another issue is the terrain it is on, which is a number of small hills that wear it out. There is also apparently no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool off.

The characteristics of the setting affect the rider because, as the terrain got rougher, things for the rider got more difficult. In paragraph @ NUM1; there is a sentence that says: “ It is written : Rough Road Ahead : Do not exceed the posted speed limit. " In the next paragraph, the cyclist comments :" sometimes life can seem so cruel ". @ CAPS1 because the road was difficult for cyclists, life was cruel. All the characteristics like the snake, the lack of water, and the hills are all obstacles in life that people have to experience. We may not like it, but the payoff at the end is magnificent.

The characteristics of the frame that affect the rider are the road conditions and the weather. he struck bad and wicked water. along with other dangerous things he also tried to cross a desert where he had already drunk all his water bottles and had nothing left to drink, he was very dehydrated and had to drink Nesles water. It was difficult for him to continue, being so dehydrated, but he had to. at one point a big snake almost took the whole road and he had to make his way through, his driving conditions were so bad, he thought he was going to die, he said the birds were going to eat him.

The characteristics of the frame indeed affect the cyclist.

Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills and dead, dry tumbleweed, those features of the frame the cyclist was passing through have the greatest effect of all. They showed the treacherous path he took, the obstacles he had to overcome to overcome.

If they omitted these sections, the audience could say / think they were traveling on any old trail, for all they know, the cyclist could travel along a windy river passing through beautiful towns developed, so that you see the characteristics of the frame help define the mood and also reveal the confidence of the story.

When you do something really too often you get used to it, well I think it's the same with how sitting affects the characteristics of the rider.

He felt so free and how he climbed high and tall hills. But above all he believed that he could find his way in the end. He said it himself, he always stayed in the future.

One of the biggest issues the author faced in his essay was his environment. The setting for the story in Yosemite presented many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the rider. He had to cycle many miles, but had only a limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run out, which increased his determination to find the next city before it collapsed. It is this determination that takes him from ghost town to ghost town and moves the story forward. Another big issue was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he cycled through. Any wrong turn (which he took, thanks to the direction given to him) could cause him to lose and deviate from his track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where would be next time that kept him from riding a bike, with difficulty and made an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quotes: "About forty miles from the pedal, I came to the first 'town'. This place may have been a prosperous place at one point, say, before the last world war, but that morning it met the traditional definition of a ghost town. This quote shows that even after many miles, he had seen no sign of life, which would have heightened his desperation to continue seeking civilization.

In Joe Kurmaskie's 'Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit', the author describes the startling details of the frame and how they contribute to the condition of the rider. For example, the author wrote, “On a long crippling hill, a building appears. I wiped the sweat from my eyes. The way the author described the hill as " crippling " should have how much energy it took from the rider. Another quote that aided the cyclist's journey was, "That smoky bluesy '' Summer time '' tune echoed through the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain." It expressed how dehydrated the summer heat was making him. I believe the author used modification details to substantiate the description of the rider's condition. I think the frame description improved the reader's perception of the rider's course.

The terrain the rider is facing doesn't help much as he is almost running out of water he encountered some hills which made him very tired and thirsty even more. Also when we stumbled upon the juice factory he spent a lot of energy getting there because he was excited and it made him thirstier even more. Therefore, if he had run out of energy after all this, he wouldn't have been able to make it to the bait shop.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. First of all, he's in the middle of nowhere, and he doesn't know which direction he's going, and he doesn't know the people who live there either. The other thing is that he has no food or drink, so without eating and drinking, he cannot have energy, so he cannot ride a bicycle.

The characteristics of the story setting affect the rider in several ways. For example, in the story it says, “At the same time, tumple weed crossed my path. That means he's in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know you usually only see wild weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affects the cyclist because he is already lacking water so being in a place as hot as the desert has made him calm or dehydrated. Another feature of the setting of this story that affected the most cyclist is the hills he had to climb. This affected him as he was already dehydrated and climbing hills made him work harder, causing him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. These are two examples of how the frame characteristics of this story affected the faster cycle.

The framework of this story is very hard for the cyclist. Its main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water, all of your major organs will cook under the scorching sun. Another problem was the condition of the ground. It is very difficult to cycle on dry, bumpy terrain. These are some of the problems encountered by the cyclist.

The characteristic of the frame greatly affected the rider. It was a hot summer day and there was no water. With the heat, he could have had heat stroke. Another problem was the hills. He didn't have a lot of energy, ?? the sun snatched it from him.

The characteristics of the “ Rough Road Ahead ” setting adversely affect the rider. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water, you might as well run out of life. Without water, dehydration sets in and affects not only your body, but also your mind. The rider only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. “ I had touched my water bottles quite regularly and was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Through the deserted towns he encountered, he looked for a source of water but found none that was usable. " When I tried a drop or two, there was the flower of battery acid. The @ CAPS1 function was the heat. It started to disturb his mind and take its toll on his body quickly. " I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it was not a mirage. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was taking a path that nature claimed and that was not often taken by people " crossed my path and a ridiculously big snake blocked most of the sidewalk ". As you can see, the rider was negatively affected by the characteristics of the scenery in “ Rough Road Ahead ”.

The characteristic of the tuning affected the rider because if there is a rough road ahead of you, you just need to be able to handle the ups and downs, bumps. The author was afraid that he would die and that the birds would collect his bones to clean him.

In the story, the cyclist faces many problems that could prevent him from not completing his trip. First, his water supply could dehydrate him and he could pass out. Another problem is the hot weather in June, which could cause him heatstroke and literally die. Rough terrain could prevent it from completing the trip as it could burst a bicycle tire and should walk. The cyclist faces many issues that could end his journey and possibly even his life, but he resists and survives.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. One way is that cool pine trees keep the sun from hitting it and getting heatstroke. Another way is that the towns he visited had bad or no water at all and he was becoming dehydrated. The heat of the sun made him feel funny, he hoped he didn't see mirages.

The scenery is a Californian desert in June, it affects the cyclist as it is very hot and he only drinks a few glasses of water. There is no room for the cyclist to stop and get more water. He said, "There is no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind." As you can see, this kind of tuning would definitely affect the rider.

One feature about the setting that @ MONTH1 affected the rider was the fact that he was running out of water and when he pumped water he said he pumped with all his might at the start a substance similar to the tar oozed out followed by brackish water, he said the water tasted like battery acid. Also in this setting, the cyclist notices a change of terrain on a flat road and then short hills, followed by a diamond-like snake behind.

In the " Rough Road Ahead " test : Do not exceed the posted speed limit. " By Joe Kurmaskie. The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as he was on a bicycle and it was hot, he ran on bumpy roads and hills. For example, he says " No miles in the next section of the road." He noticed that the grounds were changing. The flat terrain has been replaced by short rolling hills. The example of @ CAPS1 is "Large rings of dried sweat encircled my shirt and the growing awareness that he could die of heat stroke." These examples show that it was not easy and how the characteristics affected the rider. In conclusion, this story shows that you should never follow the instructions of an elderly person, especially if the weather is hot and you are riding a bicycle.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in different ways. For starters, the road terrain became flat and bumpy, making the journey easy for the rider. In the story, it says: "Rough Road must not exceed the posted speed limit." Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the roads and his water supply was limited, he got very thirsty when he finally said an old town ahead, he stopped and it looked like it 'was a ban, he started pumping water. the water pump and it didn't matter how long it pumped because it looked like battery acid. The quote from the story read, “When I tried a drop or two the battery acid tasted harsh,” these were a few characteristics of the frame that affected the rider throughout their trip.

The characteristics of the frame greatly affect the rider in this story. Cyclist is cycling in a desert, "... I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June." @ CAPS1 it was hot and the sun was beating down on the rider, "the sun was starting to beat ..." @ CAPS1 it's far away and there is no one to offer help or assistance, ". ... that fits the traditional definition of a ghost town. There are no natural water sources for the rider to fill their water bottles with. He may have died of dehydration. "I proceeded to on all fours and I operated the handle of the rusty water pump with all my might, but only a tar-like substance leaked out . " There @ CAPS1 was a poisonous snake in the road that could have bitten the cyclist . @ CAPS1, there were some hills that needed more energy to get up. As the rider had to use more energy to climb the hills, he was more tired and thirsty.

The characteristics of the decor influence the attitude of the cyclist towards the elderly. Ever since the rider listened to the men's old instructions, he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt at steering had made the rider almost delicious, the setting had seriously compounded the problem. The scorching sun and high California desserts in mid-June left the rider dehydrated and tired. When it comes to a rusty " black tar oozed out " water pump , you can imagine the rider furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and weeds had made the rider feel skeptical about his decision to follow the men's old instructions.

The cyclist in “ Rough Road @ CAPS1 ; Do not exceed the speed limit displayed "begins in the" serenity of a summer evening easy "taking the advice of the old road. At first, when the sun beat down on him, it did not bother him; the Thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later, however, his resolve faded when he realized his "shortcut" wasn't that short after all. The "high deserts of California in June" and the altered terrain accentuated it. his dehydration and his need to find water. The emptiness of his surroundings with "no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind" caused him to focus on the horizon and telling himself that if he could, everything would be fine. Finally, a building appeared. The hope he took from it gave him the strength to move forward. Ironically, it was an abandoned building . Cyclist describes it as a “Welch's grape juice and bottling factory.” @ CAPS2 this he had lost hope and bay his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. As he walked away from the factory, he saw a fishing camp and immediately regained hope. By going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never to follow the road advice of others.

The reading setting affected the rider as it was hot, dry and nothing around. Being warm was part of the environment that affected him because he had to drink a lot of water. It was dry all around him so he couldn't stop nowhere and cool off. Plus, when the going got tough, there was nothing but ghost towns and abandoned buildings. This is how the frame affected him.

The features mentioned in the story settings made it more difficult for the rider. The lack of water during a summer in California made it very uncomfortable for the cyclist to cross the deserts. The worst part is when he tried to suck up the pebbles to circulate his saliva in his mouth, he ended up swallowing one.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider as his body has difficulty adjusting to his life threatening situation. The neat and desert atmosphere drains his body of water, @ CAPS1 he must continue to pedal. In addition, the land is devoid of water, so there is nothing to refuel.

I think if we could put the penalties on those who speed up there would be fewer car crashes, really those with bad road rage should be in anger management

Many characteristics affected the rider. One feature included the first ghost town he passed through. "But that morning, it met the traditional definition of a ghost town." It must have affected him a bit as he now knows that the people who told him the shortcut haven't cracked in a while. Another feature that affected the rider was the lack of water in a "California desert in June". The rider now knows that it may take some time before he runs out of water. The hills also had an effect on the cyclist as he now knew he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water. The Welch building also affected it since it was abandoned and there were no drinks left. In conclusion, the cyclist had to face many obstacles on his way to the national park.

The cyclist sees his route affected by a succession of events which will make his route travel ?? each time more difficult and difficult. One of the first mistakes he makes is taking advice from people who have no idea where they are. @ CAPS1 (I shouldn't have let them take a look at my map.) The desert temperature also influenced it (I was traveling in the high desert of California). The cyclist also finds himself with a combination of emotions sometimes he thinks he will go away and sometimes he thinks he will be okay. (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I thought I had too impressive a wig to look for Gary.

The characteristics of the start affected the rider going on the list of if dyhrate who did not leave town dumps instead of following his name made him go in the middle as the start sites on the beach do the right thing site at ??. ?? ?? the what he flies inside that "i went right when i had always asked him ????????? find on the last one ?? is the bitter. this is said ?? he did not see it and felt that it was not walking, that it was falling on it and that it was grabbing a stick of dust.

In the story, man has great difficulty in trying to get water. He faces many obstacles in the story. For example, he traveled about @ NUM1 miles without water. Also, there are a lot of hills and turns in the story that slow him down He struggles to get to the water due to lots of obstacles

In the story, the cyclist takes a bike ride to @ LOCATION1. He has a new map which is doing very well, until he asks these old men the best way to get there by taking less time and getting them faster i.e. by shortening . He takes directions and feels good there. But very quickly, things change, he experiments new grounds and it becomes much more difficult. The kind of frame it faces are steep hills, speed limits it can't exceed, dry hot weather, and it has no water. All of these characteristics combine to make the situation worse. While he is going through these things, he feels like he is going to die and wants to give up. But eventually he finds someone and doesn't ask for directions. So the lesson is not to follow a stranger's instructions unless you are prepared to face the unexpected.

The characteristics affected the rider due to the rough roads. It affected him because it slowed him down, I know because in the story it was written “ Rough Road Ahead Don't exceed the posted speed limit ”. which means slow down or you will have an accident. Another feature is that it was hot, which means he was losing water because it had evaporated or he was drinking it. I know this because it said " the water bottles contained a few mouthwatering sips of water ", which means that there was little left.

The settings affect the rider in several ways on the way to Yosemite. Now, when he took the short cut, one thing that made it difficult already, was that it was June and he was in the wilderness. He also tells how he got to a few deserted towns, so there was no way to replenish his water. He says, “I pumped this handle for several minutes, but the water was not cooling. When I tried a drop or two, it tasted like battery acid. @ CAPS1 thing about its changed setting was the hills. But once he gets to a bait shop, the old man asks him if he knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he replies: " yes sir: I have a very good map ". @ CAPS2 by this he understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or the road he knows because he will know what to expect. This is how the setting changed.

The characteristics of the frame affect the rider in several ways. One of the reasons it affects him is that the description makes him look hotter than he actually is. It says "two hundred degree hood neihbor". He says it's really hot. The characteristics of the setting affected him because I made it look warmer and it took him too far.

In the test, the frame characteristics affected the rider. The cyclist used words to describe the setting such as "flat road" and "short, rolling hills". There were also more examples. The way the rider described the frame gave the reader a visual image. I think the rider was affected by the frame.
