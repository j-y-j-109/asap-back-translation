When will they be here ! When will they be here ! I was in @ CAPS1 to visit my family and my cousins would come from @ LOCATION1. I was so excited and very impatient that I couldn't wait for them to arrive in their black car and for me to give them a hug that would make them lose the light of day. It was around lunchtime and I was looking out the window eating a cold pizza. I kept counting down from ten to say they're going to be here in @ NUM1, but they've never been theirs. Soon I realized it was around @ NUM2 pm and I knew I wouldn't see them until tomorrow and I will be patient so that I don't waste all day thinking about it.         After a good night's rest I got up for breakfast and then looked @ CAPS2. @ PERSON1 ! @ PERSON1 ! Honk ! Honk ! Could it really be no, couldn't it be uncle @ CAPS3 and his big bike. A few hours later, I again heard @ PERSON1 and I said the uncle left @ CAPS3 probably, but I then gathered my cousins @ and @ Organization1 CAPS5 who flew from the chair and totally gave them a hug that knocked the daylights out of them. I guess patience is really the key.
Once someone was patient with me was when I was younger and my sister now taught me how to braid. It took a long time and my little hands weren't always correcting things. But my sister always helped me when she had the time. I thought I would never do it right. And it was when she said these words to me " practice makes perfect " that she let me choose from her best selection of strings. And she slowly explained how to do it. And before I knew it, I would braid as well as her. I'm so happy that she encouraged me to keep trying and that she was patient with me the whole time. And this is an example of a time when someone was patient with me.
Once was hard to wait, but I was patient and in the end it was @ CAPS1. Once my family and I were going to the world @ CAPS2. The morning I woke up I was so excited because I really wanted to get to the airport and go to the world @ CAPS2 @ CAPS4 we packed the car we drove to the airport. In the car, my brother and I were talking about our excitement. Once we got to the airport we had dinner excited! When we got to the area where you were waiting for your plane, the clerks told everyone waiting for the same plane as us that the plane to @ LOCATION1 would be about an hour late. My whole family and I really wanted to get to the world of @ ORGANIZATION1 ASAP, but we just had to wait, we walked around the airport and had something to eat. Then @ CAPS4 we just had to wait twenty minutes! My family and I just sat and talked and before we knew it we were getting on the plane. Being patient can really help soutition.
The @ DATE1 was my birthday, I had just had @ NUM1. I was so happy !!! Well, while I was happy and my big sisters got together for my birthday, my mom was at work. We had everything at the party like juice, soda, food, candy, fries, ice cream, but no cake. My mom was supposed to pick it up on the way out of work. Then it was time to open the presents. After opening all of my presents, it was time for cake and ice cream. We had ice cream but no cake but i didn't cry and scream like a baby my sister did but she was still @ NUM2 and I was @ NUM1 and had to act like a @ NUM1 year . My mom called and told us she was a little late and would be there after I got my cake. When my mom got home we cut the cake and when I took the first bite I thought it was worth the wait! I was happy to have waited like a grown-up, but I was even happier to be @ NUM1 !
I am normally always patient, but the time when I needed to be the most patient was when I baby sat @ DATE1. I was babysitting with my older cousin @ PERSON2. We babysat four-month-old twins, little girls for eight hours! Let me tell you that babies take a lot of work and you need a lot of patience with them. Once during the day you had to be patient with them, that was when they were crying. These babies cry a lot and for a long time so it took a long time to calm them down. Like when I sat a twin he fell asleep, he started screaming and I was patient to take the time and calm them down. Another event during that day that I used with patients was putting them to sleep. The baby I was primarily caring for took a long time to fall asleep. So I was patient as I walked around the house and bounced it up and down in my arms. Of course, they both fell asleep eventually. A third time, I used patience to feed them. You see they were very little twins, so they took a long time to eat. Also, when I fed the baby I was caring for, Natalic, I had to be patient not to panic when she spat all over my shirt. @ PERSON2, my cousin was also patient when "her baby" @ PERSON3 spat on her as well. That day took a lot of patience, but it was still a lot of fun : and you can see that @ LOCATION2 and @ PERSON1 was a lot of work, but patience definitely helped me and @ LOCATION1, to get through.
Patience is a very long task @ CAPS2 the rewards outweigh the time you waited for the thing you expected. From waiting for a computer to start a row to roller coasters, your patience will be rewarded. However, many people are not very patient. (@ CAPS1 me) @ CAPS2 they can learn over time to be as patient as monks. Anyway, be @ CAPS1 a trile and a lot of patience.
Once when I was little we would go to the dentist in Ann- @ CAPS1 and it was a lot of traffic and me my sister and my brother were in the car (we ended up waiting @ NUM1 hours) I was really unhappy so my mom told me to be patient. I didn't know what that meant back then, but now I do. It means to wait and be calm. When I got to the dentist and sat down. I found out I was late so we had to come home and start over tomorrow.
One time I was patient was when I went to Sedar Point. We drove from @ LOCATION1 to @ LOCATION2 and it was a long drive. When we got there it was a long queue to enter. My mom said 'okay it's time to be patient'. Once we entered we went to the first landing stage we saw. There was also a long queue. Mom said "we're going to have to be patient all day if we're going to do all the rides."
Have you ever had to be patient? I had to be patient when my older brother broke his finger. This happened at his friend's house on a trapoline on a hot day @ DATE1. When my brother broke his finger it looked like he was @ PERSON1. My mom wanted to see her hand and her knuckles and everything moms always do . I felt like it took so long to ask my mom if she was in the same room as my brother. My mother called the doctor's office on the third day of the accident and made an appointment for my brother. I thought okay anything, I'll stay home while he goes to the doctor, but there was one person on the way and she's a mom. She said I had to go to the doctor with her and my brother even if I didn't want to. After that day, I kept selling my mom excuses that I couldn't go, but she didn't buy them. So after a very short drive that felt like a long torture drive, we were in the waiting room waiting. In this waiting room, we were waiting, waiting, waiting and guess what else if you said wait, then you are right. In the meantime, the second merged with the minutes and the minutes merged with the hours. Those " hours " of torture made the car ride look like a kitten ride. There was no entertainment of anything that would distract those cruel minutes of going so slowly. If ever a snail has ever realized that six times slower and you will begin to understand how slowly time has passed. Finally, after all the time we've waited, the doctor walks into the room and asks for my brother. The only problem with the doctor is that she's even more boring. The doctor sat down and spoke endlessly using words so long the @ CAPS1 looks small. I was so tired that I stopped worrying about it. Finally I was time to get warm, no one was happy except me. I was so happy to leave the doctor. Let's review. I had to be patient when my brother broke his finger. My brother turned into @ PERSON1 and had to go to the doctor. The doctor's office was extremely boring. I was patient and was finally able to leave the doctor's office. Sometimes being patient has its rewards. My reward was being able to leave the doctor's office.
Once at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I received arrows but no one was there to sound my arrows. So instead of ringing the bell a hundred times, I just waited there quietly and patiently. I was waiting around @ NUM1 min for some to come and when someone came they said thank you for being so patient and called me so I could leave. It was a time when I was patient.
Once I got up to speed, I stood in line for lunch. I was in the pacent becou thair where a lot of other people were lining up and people letting others cut them, so the line was getting longer. This is the story of one of the times when I was pacent.
Once I was patient ??? my dad was going to send me a gift @ CAPS1. I was waiting for him and just waiting for him. While I was waiting I come and my ??? the day i sleep i play games i invite a lot of classes and watch tv after two weeks i only got it it was @ ORGANIZATION1 dangs game and a hundred dolar i call my dad and say thank you after he played my game all night and save my hundred bucks until my birthday. It was the time when I was skated
As I walked down the alley looking for the perfect gift I saw the night before. I find he was exhausted. Today was my mom's birthday and I found the gift. The perfect gift a precious moment figurine. I asked the manager if the fact had any in the back, unfortunately they didn't. He said, "The new cargo should arrive at five o'clock." I didn't think I could wait another three hours. My father drove me home. I was pacing up and down thinking it would occupy, unfortunately it wasn't. Finally, I realized that I needed to relax and be patient first. I know it was five o'clock and my dad and I were back to the store in no time and there was the perfect gift right in front of me. I picked it up and gave it to the clerk to scan. I hand her the money and go home. When mum comes home I hand the gift to mum and realize that the patient is helpful when it comes to waiting.
We were going to @ ORGANIZATION1 one day for a very special event to see the President of the United States from @ LOCATION1, @ PERSON1 when we got to the park we were going to see him there were cars parked a mile away and half ! When we finally parked the car we started to walk it was a long walk but when we finally got to the gate I was excited! after going through security we thought we would never get there. My parents and I stood for about two hours, I think, until finally everyone lay down and looked for them, singing the national anthem. The President stepped onto the podium and delivered a speech. It was the longest queue I had ever stood in and I was very patient.
One day I was at a baseball game at @ LOCATION1 and the line was huge, it was half a mile and we were at the end. So it took us about an hour to get up there so I had to be very very patient or else my dad would have gone crazy so this is my story about patience.
There were only @ NUM1 minutes left of class and I had @ CAPS1 to do. So I watched the clock go by so slowly. @ NUM1 minutes left @ NUM3 @ NUM4 to @ NUM5, the teacher asked : " what are you doing ? " I said :" @ CAPS1. I @ CAPS1 to do "" Why do not you lower your head "? I was losing my patience and was going to crack, but I didn't. I put my head down and the next thing I know is it's time to go. I kept my patience and didn't get into trouble.
Did you know that patients are one of the keys to happiness. For example, I was walking and @ CAPS1 this guy approached. To and started telling me about his family (just remember I wasn't very patient at the time.) @ CAPS1 he kept going on and on until I broke down and said " know you that you must be silent ” ! wrong he said "yes" @ CAPS1 ran home., crying. @ CAPS1 I got home and when I got home I felt sad for the guy, @ CAPS1 said "sorry".! And for some reason he said ' I got you ', I said ' what ? I was so angry but I was happy when it was over. But it taught me a lesson, always be patient because you don't know who is looking, literally.
I am always patient with my family, my mom and @ CAPS1 do a lot of me and are always patient if they take it anywhere. Sometimes for hockey my mom and @ CAPS1 take me. Hockey. My @ CAPS1 usually takes, but on @ DATE1 my mom takes me and I'm patient. For homework I'm always patient, if I go to @ PERSON1's golfland my mom says she will take it and I'm still patient.
Patience. My cousin ??? the most patient person I have ever met. @ LOCATION1 is studying to be a doctor, he has to spend eight years in college. Eight years of terminology, teaching cells, learning human analogy, he must be patient. My cousin goes to @ ORGANIZATION1 which is quite close to me and my aunt. Romeo often comes home and never complains about homework or school or anything that has the most patients ??? believe me. He is the perfect model. Romeo is in his fifth year of college, which means there are four to four left. He doesn't have a certain way of relieving stress other than hugging his ??? Not easy to be motivated and relaxed ??? is it that. Before leaving for @ ORGANIZATION1 he told me that patience is half the process and half the reward. Romeo is patient.
Here's a story, about patience, in my own way called @ CAPS1's @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. "@ CAPS4, hurry up and find my shoes ?????? And I don't want to be late for school anymore ." I shouted at my @ CAPS4 "@ CAPS1", @ CAPS4 said of a rushed voice, you asked me a second ago, it doesn't take a second to find lost shoes, you just have to be patient. "I know, I know, I sighed but I still don't want to not be late "" I know but remember, being patient will go a long way. " " @ CAPS6 "I agreed. While @ CAPS3 in school @ CAPS1 remembered his mother's words and was very patient all @ CAPS3. She didn't whine with her friends that the bus was so slow to get to school, she didn't cut her friends in line to get her food anymore Quickly. At the gym, she didn't catch volleyball when someone had it in her shoe so she wasn't bored instead she just stayed there. At the end of @ CAPS3 @ LOCATION1, friends started to act like her too i. Their teacher noticed how very patient they were when they raised their hands instead of babbling the answer. At the end of this class period, they all received candy. The other students noticed it and wondered how they could get candy. Then in the next class @ LOCATION1, she could feel everyone's eyes on her, but she knew it was for a good reason. Everyone learned to raise their hands and not to push when they left the classroom. Pretty soon everyone started having candy and the teachers were so happy! When I got home with @ CAPS3, I pumped up my @ CAPS4 so much that I told him what happened at school. I then learned to be patient from there.
The day I wake up for free chips @ CAPS1 from lays. When I was at @ ORGANIZATION1 they gave away @ chip CAPS1 for free I was number @ NUM1 @ CAPS2 once I got to the front @ CAPS3 @ NUM2 frend @ NUM3 It was a giveaway day where we finished @ CAPS4 laye. I was very patient i waited four hours at NUM4 hours and at NUM5 minutes we got chaw we got chip and left on we entered liaret geme we were very tired we were going to @ LOCATION1 this was the worst patient i have @ CAPS5 in. @ PERSON1
@ CAPS1 was a beautiful morning, the sky was blue, the birds were singing and my sister was skydiving. She and her boyfriend zone were playing to go skydiving, so me, my friend and my parents followed each other to watch. We had a few people in front of them so we had to wait about an hour. Then another hour passes. Still not close to being there again. We were starting to get hungry so we went into town and ordered some breakfast, got our drinks and were about to get our food when we got a call saying they were coming soon. We had to cancel our meal and hurry back to the place. We got there, still not there. Not sure how but something happened that made us sit and wait in the middle of the field for almost four more hours! Finally, in their turn, they boarded the plane and flew away. They circled the field for a while, then @ CAPS1 looked like a little dot that fell off the plane, then another followed. They have sailed to success. @ CAPS1 turns out we sat there for eight hours before they jumped up. Not to mention the hour and a half of driving there. I think I was quite patient that day.
“Left! Right! High kick left, circular view ! The boys' arms are moving so fast you can barely see them. His legs are hitting the sack with tremendous power! ” @ CAPS1 ! ” the old man shouts “my boy.” @ CAPS2 says “you are lacking in patience.” The old man named @ ORGANIZATION1 puts a blindfold on the boy named @ CAPS3 and throws sandbags at him. The first one hits him in the head, but the boy kicks second and shatters it. @ CAPS2 grabs third and uses it to block fourth. Boy has learned to be patient and wait for enemy to strike first.
Once, I was patient when @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1 didn't work, everyone sat down and begged. It took the hole hour there was a bit, chitt was chatting her and there but mostly everyone was calm for her while a student capo helped her. We're going to watch a movie about @ NUM1 themes from @ CAPS2, but when she tried to play the movie it didn't happen, you could hear it but couldn't see it, at the end of the hour you could see but you couldn't hear it, "but it worked for all the other classes" @ PERSON1 said the next day she gave us some fruit snacks for being so patient and she made it work movie first it was just gray and white she rocked a card then she showed a color but the day I was patient was @ NUM2 time. I was patient with a teacher she was proud of me and i was proud of me cant believe what i did for @ PERSON1 then it happened again this time she left everyone relax on our chair and talk with our friend but i just wait for her to fix it @ CAPS1 but the next day she didn't give us a treat because our treat was just chilling on our chairs and talking with our friends. It was a time when my classmates and I were patient.
When I PATIEN we had to wait in line for a @ CAPS1 Coster I was afraid some kids in line were unpaitent and wanted to get on the @ CAPS2 fast as I was patient and waited useful we got on I verry scared when i went down i had a smile on my face i was glad i was patient
Being patient is important. People should always be patient and not rush anything. All you have to do is take your time and wait. People need to understand that if you are not patient then special things want to happen to you. If you've ever wanted something, then you have to be patient. One day at @ ORGANIZATION1, my cousin, shayna was not patient as she wanted to get on the dance box. But, she couldn't because a little girl named @ ORGANIZATION2, was on the dance box and shayna was not happy. And you know us girls when you understand our attitudes. Shayna got mad and started to cry and roll her eyes at @ ORGANIZATION2. @ CAPS1 she is now mine and said: "She wants to let me continue", @ CAPS1 I said: "@ PERSON1` @ CAPS2 you have to be patient and wait your turn because she was on it first and it would be rude and unfair to bring her down. @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1` @ CAPS2 apologized and they both took turns on the dance box. But hey @ PERSON1` @ CAPS2 was happy and she learned her lesson.
One time when I was patient was when my mom broke her hip. When my mom broke her hip she moved slower than my grandpa, you are probably wondering what time does that make her patient, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 had to follow her wherever she went if @ CAPS2 was not patient I think my mother would be in a worse state than she was in @ CAPS2 means @ CAPS2 took almost fifteen minutes to walk to her room. Normally I do 'm not a patient person, but when it happened, I had to be patient. I'm happy @ DATE1 for being patient because now I'm more patient than before. My mom is proud of my behavior, because I grew up for a few days to help her when she needed @ CAPS2. Being patient is good, you see life differently. Now I can imagine myself being patient. I mean, I'm not happy that my mom is hurt but I'm happy with the consequence of the problem. After the big accident I learned that everyone needs a little patience like me, this is an example of how I thought I was small, I have always been there patience , without my mother.
I know a girl, she is my friend and her name is @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 is a very good person. She eats all of her vegetables, does all of her work around the house, and has A rights. @ PERSON1 has only one problem. She is not patient. One day @ PERSON1 and I went to the movies. We went there on a Saturday night so it was quite busy. There was a long queue for @ CAPS2 tickets. @ PERSON1 looked at me and moaned. I told him: "@ CAPS1 patient @ PERSON1, it will only take ten minutes." @ PERSON1 moaned again and crossed his arms. "@ CAPS2 on it, potato sak," I told him. After about two minutes, there were only five of us behind the counter. @ PERSON1 was pacing like she was in the worst case senerio. She started pulling her hair as I stared blankly at her. She ran over to me and said, "@ PERSON2, we owe @ CAPS2 to this meter before I explode!" I looked at her with my eyes, why don't you shut up. Then she nodded. I stayed patient with @ PERSON1 all night to make sure she didn't go crazy. I made sure to keep my cool to make sure we didn't hunt @ CAPS2. You should always @ CAPS1 patient or @ MONTH1 things go wrong.
Today I am talking about patents. Patents mean taking something easy or handling something with comaness. Like for example I went to a machean @ CAPS1 and I wanted to have money, @ CAPS2 I put the card and the pen, then I wanted @ NUM1 dolors @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 gave me only the ticket @ CAPS4 cash @ CAPS4 card @ CAPS2 I forgot @ CAPS3 I just called the company and received the money and the card. New is the main story I go to the mall to get a shoe @ CAPS3 go one hundred and ten @ CAPS3 was on sale one hundred dollars, @ CAPS2 I wanted to buy it the sad cashier "one hundred and ten dollars if he please "@ CAPS2 I said" him @ CAPS3 was on sale he's sad "come out of my store @ CAPS2 I told him I came to buy a shoe. @ CAPS2 I returned @ CAPS3 and evacuated. Theaters when I was patient.
I was patient once when I went to @ ORGANIZATION1 from @ LOCATION1 with @ CAPS4 grandma @ CAPS1, grandpa @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS4 brother @ ORGANIZATION2. We were all walking around and we saw a guy drawing a cartoon with people. I said “grandma @ CAPS1 can't we do this please.” @ CAPS3 said “yes”. Brother @ CAPS4 must have the first one. I was just waiting for hers to be done. Then her photo was taken, we looked at her and we all laughed. I was next, I sat in the seat, the sun was right on me. I got really hot and didn't just want to sit down but I was patient. I didn't say a word, I just sat down and smiled. A photo that took about @ NUM1 to draw seemed like half an hour to me. Then I was done. I looked at the picture, laughed and smiled, I liked it. I was patient and got what I wanted. Once I was patient at @ ORGANIZATION1.
Patience is a privilege that I usually don't have, @ CAPS1, however I made an exception. @ CAPS3 brother, @ PERSON1 ran towards the car running through the pouring rain which described the mood of @ CAPS6 that day. @ CAPS14 opened the car door, and the first thing that came out of his mouth was "@ CAPS2 needs to talk." @ CAPS3 @ CAPS5 replied. "About @ CAPS4 to @ NUM1?" I knew @ CAPS5 didn't want to talk about what happened to @ PERSON1, @ CAPS4 @ CAPS14 had a suspension at school, around me. If @ CAPS3's brother hadn't cared what I heard, I don't think I would have fought. It was not the moment. @ PERSON1 has leaked his story, causing tension in the air. "@ CAPS6, some guys who I realized aren't really friends poured water on the sweatshirt @ CAPS3 on purpose, @ CAPS12 I went to say the principle, @ CAPS3 @ LOCATION1" " @ CAPS8. That's what you're supposed to do, "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS15 interrupted. "@ CAPS9. @ CAPS12 the person who made it, @ PERSON2, got in trouble and took the time out. When @ CAPS14 came out, @ CAPS14 started following me and I felt threatened." J held my breath @ CAPS3, looking straight ahead. The tension was what I was breathing, not @ CAPS10. "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS5 completed the following part," @ CAPS12 you. Did you start hitting him ? "" @ CAPS13, yes. "@ CAPS14 miserably admitted." @ PERSON1, you need to find constructive ways to release your anger. There are going to be a lot of assholes. You can't start hitting them, "@ CAPS15 growled." I know, I know now. I'm sorry, "@ CAPS3's brother shut up in his very annoying manner. I shyly asked @ PERSON1," Do you want a hot dog when @ CAPS2 gets home? "" @ CAPS16 "I'm suppressing any rude response to the nasty tone @ CAPS14 was using. I understood that @ CAPS14 had had a bad day. @ CAPS1, I realized that being patient and understanding with @ CAPS3 brother was the best thing I could do. I think I gained a little more patience that day.
The place where I was paitent was at my mother's doctor's appointment. It was a small health center at @ LOCATION1 road and it was small and I had to wait in the lobby and it was boring. I first started watching the chanel @ NUM1 news he shared. Then I went to the front counter to grab a piece of blue paper and started drawing when I finished drawing it looks like a car that looks like, it was a distant car; and then I started looking for something to do. I started to find and find, then there was an automotive magazine and there was cool cars, low cars, exotic cars, costomes, and more. When my mother was done I was patient then we left the house
Once I was patient, it was when I was in line at the petting zoo. The animal I was waiting to see was a donkey. It was a hot day @ DATE1 around three in the afternoon, of course a donkey was the crowd favorite animal. There are only a few people who observe other animals. In the line of donkeys, there were hundreds of them. I was in the middle of the line. I was starting to get tired but I had to take care of this donkey! I was very patient while waiting and waiting and waiting. Finally, only a few people were in front of me! I could have a slight sight of the donkey. A few minutes have passed since I stroked the donkey : @ CAPS1 was that patience worth it or what ? I said to myself. I left the petting zoo happy. I had never been so patient in my life! I gave myself a bat on the back.
One time I was in the doctor's office and there were a lot of people there and I would just come up there and my dad was telling me we should go because it's so crowded and I said let's just let it go and wait and he did it person after person and my dad was pactiont so it was @ NUM1 hours until they called his name and we walked in and I got my five shots and vaxsene and we left and went home and had dinner we didn't sell tacos for dinner.
I am really not a patient person but a late day. Years at the end of the school year. My older sister @ PERSON2 was going to have a baby. And I wanted to go because it was my first nephew. So I went and my grandmother, my mother too, my other sister my # @ CAPS1 and my sister @ CAPS2 the one who is going to have the baby. Boyfriend. Where a lot of people and everyone couldn't get in at the same time, I was too young to see the baby born but I didn't want to. My sister got mad because she couldn't fit in either so she left but I stayed it was boring. But I stayed I went to the room to visit took @ num1 hours for the unborn baby we went to nine the baby was a barn around @ NUM2 I came home to sleep at @ NUM3 and am from return have there - down to @ NUM2: 00 have we seen the baby @ @ NUM5 his name was CAPS3, he is so cute and I'm so happy to be his @ CAPS4. Right now he's six months old and I love it when I see him. And when he gets older, he won't understand that I was waiting all the time for him to be born. Like @ PERSON1.
One time someone I know was impatient was in my science class during a lab project. It was actually a very funny way of looking forward to me. My classmates and I were divided into groups in different areas of the lab. We were doing a project on classifying plants by identifying the different characteristics. So everyone would try to finish their projects quickly by taping their plants to their poster. After fighting for the gang of another group that cornered him. Our group finally had the tape. So our group had just finished, and two people from another group came to get the tape. One of them tried to take pieces and I guess for the other it was taking too long. So the one who waits says: “@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2! as a sign of impatience. It was hilarious!
When I was patient. I was @ NUM1 when I got an ace. I ordered it online and waited. @ NUM2 days have passed and still nothing, a week has passed and a forklift truck stopped at our house, dropped off the package and left. I was so happy I didn't even notice it was for mom. I opened it to find some pampered chef stuff. I was really angry! @ NUM3 weeks went by and… nothing, I was upset that I didn't really know I was going to take care of it. But an ups truck came and didn't see it and guess what in the package was my ace! I didn't even realize it until @ DATE1, I was so glad I received it. That I forgot to order a game with. And that's when I was patient, see you soon.
To be patient is to wait, when one of my brothers was patient. We were there for six hours just to bail my brother out, we had to go to four different prisons to get my brother out. I was scared but I knew if I was patient it would be okay. So we were waiting until we had to bail it out before @ NUM1 hours. We were there from @ NUM2 in @ TIME1. My mother was very nervous. I told her several times to calm down, she would be fine. So he and my cousin came in, we asked if we could bail out my brother. They told us they wouldn't bail out at that time maybe around @ NUM3. So we went to get something to eat. We went back and they told us we had to sign a paper. So we did. Then it was @ NUM4 hours. They gave us something that we had to cook. We went to different stores @ NUM1 and they said we can't cash it. So we went to the hunting bank and we cashed it and we took my brother out.
One day a cool new game came out. It was a kid who had the volume @ NUM1, @ NUM2, @ NUM3 and @ DATE1, but they said it was the hot volume. The child asked his mother @ PERCENT1 @ CAPS2 said "why?" @ CAPS1 said "so I can buy this cool new game." @ CAPS2 said "@ CAPS3 your dad and I have to pay bills and buy food. @ CAPS1 said" @ CAPS4 I get it ", in a disappointing voice. @ CAPS8, when the boys' hard working dad stepped through the door. The boy said "@ CAPS5, could I get @ NUM4 ???, so I can buy this game. The dad said" @ CAPS6, I know how badly you want this game, but I am sorry, i need to help your mom pay her bills. The @ CAPS6 said "@ CAPS4 I understand." @ CAPS8 the boy's grandmother called and told me I needed someone to cut my law for @ NUM5 ". The boy smiled and said" I'll be right there. " @ CAPS1 enthusiastically mowed the lawn. When @ CAPS1 got the @ NUM5 ??? @ CAPS1 went straight to the play store and when @ CAPS1 arrived the line was @ DATE1 blocks long. Her grandmother said “ Well you must have patience. ” @ CAPS10 because the boy was next in line. To be continued"

Patience is a useful trait to get you through life. Be patient, wait calm, or be happy. A patient; A person who usually waits to see a doctor. There are several types of patients. Patient, patient or patience. The low? I will talk about two kinds. Probably not the two you might think. I will discuss a patient and be patient. While there is no pun, I feel like they both remind me of a story. One cold, gloomy morning I had to take a trip. Not a school trip, nor a vacation. A trip to the doctor's office. Why did I need it? To get my annual vaccine, that's why. It was probably not a very cold morning. I was just nervous, when we got to the doctor's office (which even seemed to be far away) the man in the office even called my dad and me up to the front window. He said, “I have an appointment for my son. And the lady at the front window said "the appointment @ NUM1 ? ''" @ CAPS1 this is the one, "said my father. " "Your son seems to be expected, tetns vaccinated" @ CAPS2 us then said to sit down. I waited patiently while reading my book. After a while, I started to feel enveloped. I was bored enough, finding myself playing with my fingers in my pockets. My dad likes to make funny statements, so he said to me, " You know what ? You're a patient patient! I laughed. My laugh was cut off by the doctor who opened the door. Before I knew it, I laughed. getting a needle in my arm. After that, I was all right. But what I learned is that being a patient patient helped me to stay calm while I vaccinated. If I don ' hadn't been so patient, it might have hurt. I learned an important lesson that day.
This story is about the hand of the fox chicken and a time when it had to be patient. Let me set the scene, hanging the plague sends chicken and his mother, @ PERSON1, to boil. They were both to be killed and thrown into the ditch. But the hound had only turned white. When he woke up he realized his situation and knew he would have to wait until night to get to the wall @ CAPS1 and waited until some bugs snowed on him. Finally, when night fell, he rolled around in the mud to avoid further loss of blood and began his journey. That's when Chicken Hound had to be patient.
I have used patience several times. I use my patience when @ ORGANIZATION1 on the bus, at home and at school. The first time I used patience was when I was fishing. I was around the time I had my @ CAPS1 tweety fishing in one hand and a bag of salt and wine in the other. And while I was waiting for a fish, I met my bubbly friend a Norwegian goose he was also out maybe a week. When I first met him I gave him some of my bait and guessed he liked warm ups so I gave him all of my bait that was on the rod. And as soon as I grabbed my chips… I took a bite! I turned out to be a very small sunfish. But still to this day I see bubbles once a year (he lives near my favorite fishing spot). And this year he had a few side kicks two ducks that I named them @ CAPS2 and @ PERSON1. There are very friendly and loving skittles. @ CAPS2 is a little shy around the other ducks and @ PERSON1 is very happy to sit next to me or a bench. And bubbles love cheeses and cuddling with her duck buddies and with me in the quiet grass of @ DATE1. And this story is true. The @ CAPS3.
My family and I were going to @ LOCATION1 for a break @ DATE1 a year, I was really excited to get there but had to take two long flights until we finally got there. My family and I got up very early to go to the airport. It was about @ NUM1 hours until we got there. Then we checked to see if our luggage was okay and we went to get our plane. Then we found out that our plane was delayed. We sat at the airport for a few hours until the plane arrived. Then we got off that plane and went to get the next one. This plane has been delayed! So we had to wait a few more hours until the plane arrived. Then we had to sit down for another plane ride until we finally got to @ LOCATION1. This trip took a lot of patience because I couldn't wait to get there.
Write your own opinion on patience. @ PERSON2 and his mother are on their way to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. @ PERSON2 has waited all his life to go. Bill's mother gets a call from cousins @ PERSON3, and bob @ PERSON1, cousins ask if they can go ? @ PERSON2's mom says of course. @ PERSON2 is a patient boy, so he lets it go. Always patient. After @ PERSON2's mom has her cousins, her mom gets another call from her five friends. They ask the same question as his cousins arise. His mother says yes. They each live in a different, remote location, so it will take twenty minutes to get to each house. Finally there. @ PERSON2 is so angry but is still patient. When his mom gets another call @ PERSON2 says who is it now!?! It's his father who calls to tell. I'm at @ CAPS3 with @ PERSON2's brother and sister, where are you? @ PERSON2's mother responded, I now dwell on @ CAPS4 is my patient story.

The movement was hare but was patient !! This is the time I had for @ CAPS3 patient
@ PERSON2 and his twin brother, @ PERSON1 enthusiastically lined up for a concert. @ PERSON1 hated going with her sister she was @ CAPS6 weird. "@ CAPS1", @ CAPS2 moans. “@ CAPS3, @ PERSON1 @ NUM1 asked to take an earpiece out of his car. “ @ CAPS4 did I bring in @ CAPS8 ? ” @ CAPS2 asked impatiently. “ @ CAPS6, you could learn how @ CAPS8 is patient, smart, "said @ PERSON2 looking at @ CAPS8 to see how many people were in line now. @ PERSON2 put his headphones back in his car and blasted '@ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 the @ CAPS9 from @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11' before the week- end allstar. Allstar weekend the awesome band they would see in concert. @ PERSON2 had always been the patient twin in fact @ CAPS3 everyone called her. @ CAPS2 was the complete opposite of her, the impatient twin . @ PERSON2 almost liked to wait, it made her more excited for things. When the time finally came @ CAPS8 to see the concert @ PERSON2 was glad she was patient; she was ten times as excited as anyone who else there.
There was a time when I was patient and I had been waiting a long time for my cousin, @ PERSON1 to walk around town and we were looking for some silly bans ok first we went to the store @ DATE1 but when we got there they were closed so we started walking again then we saw my brother and my other cousin @ CAPS1 they were on bikes and we walked so @ CAPS1 said it was a store @ PERSON2 there so get off there . Then @ CAPS1 and my brother told us to get on the bike and they walk. So we went to @ ORGANIZATION1 and saw how much they were leaking and they were smearing @ MONEY1 and some of them were smearing @ MONEY2 so we went to @ PERSON2 tree and it was a @ MONEY3 but we didn't get them because that @ PERSON1 didn't make it like the ones they had, so we went everywhere when we found them, she didn't want it. So we went to my grandma and she asked me where we were all day and I said we were looking for some silly bans. And my grandma said don't go where @ PERSON1 wants to go. If your mom tells you to come here come here and I was trying to be patient by not trying to yell @ LOCATION1.
Time my friend was patient! one day it was @ DATE1 @ NUM1. and that day the report cards came out. My grades were good, I had @ NUM2. But my friend @ PERSON1, was failing. math, she had an @ CAPS1, and she knew if her mom saw it, she would be in trouble. @ PERSON1 tried to cross it out and put a good mark, but she knew her mother would find out. so she told her mother that "the ballots haven't come out yet." And her mother believed her. So she tried to reprint it. She called me and tried to get my opinion and "I told her my honest thought and said @ CAPS2". but "if you wanna be in trouble then yeah" And she said. When his mother asked him " Are the ballots out ?" " She said" yes "then her mother discovered that it was not a real newsletter. So her mother called the teachers and it was wrong. Then she got in trouble and was patient about it and told the truth. Her mom went to the office and got the real grades and my friend @ PERSON1 was patient as she told the truth. This is a time when my friend @ PERSON1 was patient about her grades. Even though she lied and tried to change her rating. She was always honest and patient about it. I know it was wrong for both of me, tell her yeah, but she begged me not to get in trouble.
Have you ever been patient? I did and I have to say it was rewarding. I was sitting in the waiting room of @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 from @ ORGANIZATION1's. I had planned to wash my @ CAPS1, condition it thoroughly and iron it flat. The lady at the front desk called me. "I'm sorry but @ PERSON1 won't be here today. @ CAPS3 is there anyone else you would like to make your @ CAPS1 ? ' A puzzled expression spread across my face. “ @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 here ? ” I asked. “ Yes, but she has a client right now. She can take you out tomorrow at three o'clock. ” She said. suggested. "It is very good." I said. My feelings were a little upset, but everything changed when I got out. It was raining. So, I guess it was a good thing that I didn't finish my @ CAPS1. It was a good thing that I was patient. Being patient has its advantages.
A time when I was patient this was at @ CAPS1 the biggest indoor water park I expected to go on turbo twin racers. '' @ CAPS2 time @ NUM1 '' our @ CAPS3 said in a robotic voice but it was only @ NUM2 that means i have to be in the car for another two hours almost three, its not fair i thought to myself but I knew if I wanted to get to @ CAPS1 I had to be patient and wait. "I have to go to the bathroom," I said in a moaning vice. " Well, can't you hold it ?" My mom asked, I'm about to explode and you ask me if I can hold it ? I said to myself. "Okay stop here, but this will increase our time @ CAPS2." "" I @ CAPS4't core! "" I yelled at my mom as I ran out of the door of the car. When I got in the car I heard our robot @ CAPS3 say '' @ CAPS2 time @ NUM3. '' @ CAPS6 man, which means there is no more bathroom break, I'll have to hold it if I have to go back. An hour or two passed when I heard the @ CAPS3 say '' Arrived at destination on the left '' '' @ CAPS8! '' I screamed. I rushed to the main entrance of @ CAPS1 but then saw a sign that said " the water park was closed !" When all of a sudden I felt my dad's hand hit my shoulder and he said ' sorry the sport maybe it will be open tomorrow.' @ CAPS9 it wasn't open the next day it was always closed as they were working on a lot of rides that it was unsafe to enter the park on so i had to be patient all day but i couldn't we were leaving tomorrow ! The next day it was closed again until five o'clock, but we had to leave at @ TIME1. So at @ TIME1 the park was still closed and we were vetted 'Guess we can stay for the rest of the day. I'll send one more night, '' said my dad. '' @ CAPS8. '' I'm going to the park! And that's when I was patient.
I think patience means when you are calm and don't care what someone @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 is doing, patience @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 when your mom @ CAPS2 is shopping for a long time and you want to go to the video game store and you stay there a good sign of patience a bad sign of patience @ CAPS2 when you throw some from the store, @ CAPS6 good sign of patience @ CAPS2 when you are at the amusement park @ CAPS3 and there's a long queue @ CAPS7 And you're not complaining that's a very good sign of patience. A bad sign of patience In this situation @ CAPS2 that you respect all the time. . @ CAPS6 good sign of patience @ CAPS2 when you wait for your big sister to come out of the bathroom and you just wait for her to come out. A bad sign of patience @ CAPS2 when you brake the door and have to pay for @ CAPS9. Asked @ CAPS6 good sign of patience. @ CAPS2 when you are locked out and to visit your friends.
I was patient when I saw a huge bass jump out of my cabin. I waited and ate a quick break, then went fishing. My little brother wanted to go fishing too. So I was patient enough to wait for him to get some new bait and come out. So we go out front and he grabs a little bass so I picked him up and brought him over to show mum and dad what he had caught, but didn't realize that a huge bass from @ NUM1 book was there. So as soon as I got out I started @ CAPS1 ! A huge bass takes my bat. At first I thought I caught a carp. but when i saw that @ NUM1 pound bass was hopping with my bait in its mouth i was shaking with joy ! When I showed this fish to my dad he passed out and the same with me, mom and little brother Cody. And right now, this fish is in tax adermia.
One day on my way to school I went to pick up my friend, he told me he had this new game called Call of Duty World at War. by me and i said i cant wait to get home and play my new game then i said cool then he said start complaining but i have to wait another hour. I told him to be patient and wait, then he said you're right, it's not like it's going anywhere, I can play it anytime, then he told me Said I wanted to come and play, then we both went to his house and prayed for the game, I told him to remember to always be outspoken until the time is right.
The only time I was patient was when I was waiting for the game's new kill zone @ NUM1. I had to find @ NUM2 dollars. @ NUM3 lt for the game and @ NUM4 to put it on hold for me, I got it the minute the store had it on the shelves. The maneger was pushing them, so I took one and bought it. I returned home logged into my PSS and started playing online. I now have @ NUM1,190. Merged together, the game is really tough one day when there were store managers out there in the back. I'm not suggesting the game be for everyone under @ NUM6.
One day my family and I went to @ PERSON1 to see Jimmy because he was working at @ LOCATION2 fixing a belt line. After my brother and I are home from school, we went to @ LOCATION2 while traveling, we saw a lot like the city of @ Location4 and all buildings therein are . Then we saw a sign saying " you how to leave @ LOCATION3 " and another sign that you are how to get @ LOCATION1 and it is this moment- where the jam occurred. We walked through @ LOCATION5 to @ NUM1.m how not very smart it was, but the worst part was the wait. I lasted for hours sitting there, but we found ways to get away. Like looking at the sea @ PERSON2, the waves, and looking at the buildings there. This is my example of patience.
The time when I was patient was at the doctor's appointment, I was there, calm and quiet. When the doctor called, I wasn't nervous. So when the doctor gave me @ NUM1 which, @ CAPS1 didn't have to. Then my mom and I came home happy. I have hwigese and look @ CAPS2. Then we had spaghetti and went to school early. Then I had a great day at school in the @ NUM2 class when I was down. Then I went home, do my homework, clean the house, watch. @ CAPS2, dine, then went to the head started early
One time I needed to be patient was on my birthday, about a week before my birthday, my dad and I ordered me a girl doll @ CAPS1. I was super excited because this was my first doll. Shipping was a problem, however. The week of my birthday. I waited for the @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS2 truck to arrive. I was disappointed as I shipped it from @ LOCATION1 and it doesn't take that long to get there. Another week passed and still not there. I had to redouble my patience. I could follow him online, but I was still not happy. The reason it took so long to get here was that when he was already there they kept him in the post office. Then finally my mom asked when they were going to send it and the lady said, "It's on the way." A few minutes later, the doorbell rang. I screamed when I opened it. It was worth the wait.
Patience, what can I say, there is no one who personally likes things to go fast. I also don't like it when people take things slow.
Patience is not a natural thing, it is something you have to learn. Taking a three hour drive is a perfect example of patience. Exactly like what I experienced. While we were packing for the city of @ CAPS1, I @ CAPS2 does not contain me. I was already excited but mom and dad were up. “@ CAPS3, please finish packing, you see, I really want to go !” I exclaimed “You will only have to wait a minute. But I @ CAPS2 n 'have not waited, so I grabbed ??, I threw them in the trunk of our car and headed to our kitchen to finish reading a book while they were doing their luggage. After they finished cooking, dad was carrying the last of the @ CAPS4 bags to their room complaining he noticed me, patiently fixing my gaze. He thanked me by saying "@ CAPS5 for being so patient, and just for that , mom and be surprised. For you. He put the sultans down and quickly walked over to a white plastic. the some in the @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 ?????? he washes ? you ????????. Nice you so man ? responded. It just shows that this prince is really saying off. Only if you are not complaining of course. !
The time I was patient was when I was @ NUM1 when I was @ NUM1 my mom said I had to go to the dentist @ DATE2 it was @ DATE1 so @ DATE2 was @ DATE1 so @ DATE2 my mom woke me up then i said yes i go to sleep she said wake up it's time for you to go to the dentist ok mom she was like going get you some clothes i like ok so when we both put on clothes i was just saying stuff i was like i was going to the dentist to get some stickers i kept saying it so when she pulled i stopped and i Said we were here, then she parked the car I opened the door in, then she parked the car. I opened the door then my mom got us to sign then we sat there were a lot of people so when we sat @ NUM3 minutes later they called us i was about to scream but then they came over so the dentist lady took me to the room told me to lift my head so she could put the thing on so the moving doctor came in it was like we were about to clean your teeth. I was crying because I thought it was going to hurt so I was crying saying it was going to hurt so they put the thing on my teeth they said it didn't hurt so they finished @ NUM4 minutes later then the female dentist was like you choose @ NUM5 tickers I was so happy because I finally got some stickers so when we left we got in the car then fell asleep. it was the day when I was patient.
One day I had to be pachent, it all started when I raked a few levels and I was going to get paid for my work, well I was going to get it on the day @ CAPS1 I wanted it to vary second @ CAPS2 I had to be pachionto.
One of my patience stories is that this time it was with my uncles and I wanted to play the tboy @ NUM1. Well it was like five other kids and I asked him if I could play and he said I had to be patient. So I sat there and waited an hour or two at least, wanted to and didn't say a word the whole time, and then I finally got to play. This is my story about patience.
I was @ PERSON1 when I was about to get an allgen I sat down and waited @ NUM1 hours. I had played my @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. For an hour then I watched TV I had before so I started pacing my parents had to keep me from leaving @ NUM2 times. I almost got off the floor the sixth time. Then I had time to go down to the angelo room. It was a fight because I wanted to walk and they said no. but they won. Then after the angelo I had to lay flat for @ NUM2 hours. Then i have to go home
@ NUM1 years ago our immigration limit was exhausted. We needed green cards to become @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. So we went to a poor immigration center. We walked over to the front desk and told the lady we were here. She told us to go and sit her in the waiting room. There were about @ NUM2 people there ! I knew we were going to be here awhile then. We went to the waiting room. I had no way of having fun. He said stricktley on the front, no gaming devices, no musical devices. All phones should be turned off. It was tourcher. After about an hour and a half, they called out our name. I was so happy. After we got our fingerprints and everything was done and got out of the car, my mom said she was very happy with the way I was behaving in this office.
I remember a time when I was patient. I used to wait for anything. I was once so patient that I asked my mom for a game and she said, tomorrow and she got the game the day I asked her. At one point, I thought I was the most patient person in my whole family. I am so patient that I can wait a month right before I go to Cedar Point. You must be burning with patience. Some of my friends are patient, but they can't wait as long as I am. Some of them even ask me to teach them to be patient. I tell them the same thing as I tell everyone who has asked me to be patient. You have to be born patient. It's not something you learn over the years. I could want three weeks without getting paid by my dad. As some people get older, they get smaller. It doesn't work for everyone. But soon I know my patient will be like everyone else when I get older. Who knows, maybe someone in the world will be more patient than me.
I have often been patient, but I think the greatest patience I have had was hunting. You just have to sit there, not speak, and stay still. I was hunting behind my house with my uncle @ PERSON1 and we got out at six in the morning and waited until nine in the evening. The dear finally started to come in and a loved one came close enough for me to shoot. I pulled my bow and shot it, but it was so dark I could barely see it and I missed it. My uncle didn't even see him until the last second and when I pulled the trigger I knew right away he was going to fail. All you could hear was the dear running away and the arrow crashing through all the leaves. Later that night we came home really hungry.
One time I was patient was when I ordered an @ CAPS1 in the mail. It was a cool @ DATE1 @ TIME1 and I was ordering a @ CAPS1 online. When I got to shipping I paid for it and went to the payment screen. I saw how long it would take to get to my house. It was written @ NUM1 weeks. "@ CAPS3 ?!" I exclaimed. "It's long." @ CAPS4 it was decided. I had to go through @ NUM1 weeks. I was ready. @ CAPS4 I waited. And waited. And waited a little longer. Until a @ DATE2, I saw an @ CAPS1. The address said "@ CAPS6 @ CAPS7" ! I was @ CAPS4 happy ! This incident has taught me to always be patient, as there's a good chance you'll want @ CAPS3 yar in the end.
This hot tear rolled down my cheek, the hot wind blowing my blonde hair out of my face. The only thing I could think of was why God must have taken her so soon. Let's go back a week ago. We had just learned that my grandmother would soon be joining the angels. The next day, we were on a plane heading for @ LOCATION1. It was my father's mother ; he was calm back then but we all had to be patient with him as he was the closest to her among the kids @ NUM1. When we finally took off we were in turbulence the entire @ NUM2 hour flight. How mentally we couldn't get up, the food @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS3 and also the queezy feeling in your stomach. It was @ CAPS4! Flight experience I have never had. I was flying all the time, just this time it was horrible! We had to take the @ NUM3 stops until we got to @ LOCATION1. Then again @ NUM4 minutes until our bags arrive. I was so happy to get out of this death trap ! When we got home I had my last time with my grandmother. It's a memory I'll never forget. The stubborn smirk on his face when we walked in was priceless. One thing I will never forget is my nickname for her "little hen".
"@ CAPS1 ! @ CAPS1 ! @ CAPS1 !" @ PERSON2 said: "I want to go first !" @ CAPS2 cheerleading time this girl named @ PERSON2 thought she was the first to do it all. Oh yes, my name is @ PERSON3. I'm still a fiuter with @ PERSON2. I am always patient and I wait my turn because I don't want to complain or be a poor man. “ @ CAPS3 settled ! @ NUM1, @ NUM2 down up @ NUM3, @ NUM4, @ NUM5, @ NUM6 "both bases and backspots are screaming. They take out @ CAPS4 then shout" @ CAPS5! " " @ CAPS6 work. " @ CAPS7 says. " @ CAPS8 , it's my turn, @ PERSON3, you can do it better than her. " I thought" @ CAPS9, we can do it. “ One of the bases is @ PERSON1 said. I receive @ CAPS3. Hand on shoulders @ CAPS3 to rise in the air. Does the other base @ CAPS10 say "@ NUM1, @ NUM2 up ! Okay, @ NUM3, @ NUM4, @ NUM5, @ NUM6- @ CAPS5 !" " @ Job CAPS6 @ CAPS12 ! » @ CAPS13 cheers but loss. “I was so excited,” just did a @ CAPS5 pop without spoiling my @ CAPS5. " I thought excitedly. Being patient can be @ @ CAPS2 CAPS6 after. Since then, I have always been patient. This can really help you to let you know about what you have to work or work less.
Are you good at being patient? Sometimes I am, but sometimes @ CAPS1 and not @ CAPS2 will tell you a story when I was patient while @ CAPS1 is normally not patient in situations like this. I wanted to go to school with my mom so she can take a @ CAPS4 test, drop me off at the mall to meet my friends up there. While I was waiting texting and on the internet @ CAPS4 my stomach started to growl, I was hungry. I wanted to text my mom and make her run out so I could eat something while I was texting, I stopped and thought about what I was going to do. I knew @ CAPS5 had lasted a long time that she had studied for this test. I didn't want her to have a bad grade so I sat there. I texted people. People called me so I didn't think about eating anymore. After my mom finished her test, she walked out of the room. I asked him "@ CAPS5, are we going ?" she looked at me, smiled and said "I was feeling confident but know @ CAPS1 is hungry I yelled" me ", we got in the car and went to the subway. I had now the forest meal. With food, fries and a drink it was delicious. My mom dropped me off at the mall, I told my friends what happened. We laughed for some reason. @ CAPS4 we went @ ORGANIZATION1, charlete, @ CAPS7, @ PERSON1 and other places too. After thinking about it I don't ever want to do this again. I was starting and my but started to hurt . I sat there for @ NUM1 hours doing nothing, I will never do it again. At least I had some free time with my mom. That's a good side.
Once I was patient was when I was in school. I was waiting for my science teacher to call me to get ready to leave. I was sitting in my seat. She called on people to stand by the door to prepare for their next class.
Patient @ PERSON2.Hay, when will the food be (says @ PERSON1) you must be half patient, says @ PERSON2, wall in so @ CAPS1, says @ PERSON1. Well you have to unite ok; @ CAPS2 hears your food (yes @ PERSON1 yells patience is anyway? Wow that ??? ??? ??? @ CAPS3 patience is ???. You are ready, let's go ,? ?? Success lala-wait you expect it and @ PERSON1 okay , @ CAPS3 hurry up with patience, @ CAPS3 said @ PERSON1, alright i will just go slower and @ PERSON2, @ CAPS4 i will have patience.

Have you ever had to wait for the @ NUM1 time line ? it's like that for me and @ CAPS1. We were at a loss while waiting to ride a too exciting dragster. We had just arrived, the first thing we decided to do was get on the thrill ride top dragseter, but the queue lasted about three hours, we went anyway. We had just finished our first hour of wait, but it was like three. I knew I had to be patient and relax, but it was an eternity. after the hour of the hour my stomach started to growl I checked my watch it was @ NUM2 we had arrived at @ NUM3 I was hungry and stepped but I finally stayed an hour later it was our round when i got off i knew it was worth the patience. In conclusion, I learned that patience is something that you half have to have for many things in life.
Don't you ever think that only one in the world would be patience, @ CAPS4 if you don't I do. Lucky for me once I was a not very nice girl and did something I wasn't supposed to do but since I have such a nice parent they tried their best to be patient with me, like all parents, they must have given me a lecksore on what i did, but they didn't let me come off the hock so easily. "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 please go down to the office" I gather on the anoament, @ CAPS6 I was walking in a hallway I was really ??? "what have I done" I ask myself, I was thinking very hard. At no time was I at the office "yes" I said to the person who was there "Now why are you hearing" @ CAPS3 said "no" I replayed. "@ CAPS4 I had complaints from these girls" @ CAPS3 told me "@ CAPS4 oo yeah" I said "@ CAPS4 yeah" @ CAPS3 said "that was the only reason I was was really mean was because they were really mean and they were so bad they would tell my friends the only reason I was hanging out with them was because they had money that wasn't real " I said "okay I understand where you're from, let me call them" @ CAPS3 said. "@ CAPS5 and alesay come down to the office please." @ CAPS6 they came down to the hallway, I could hear footsteps there. I really didn't want to talk to them to continue.
One thing I'm not very comfortable with is the meap. The reason I'm not patient with the meap is because it's very boring you can't talk and it's boring. I hate the meap, its very difficult, you can't see Tenn see or @ CAPS1 doing the meap. The meap expects you to do a lot of work, the meap is one of the reasons i don't like michgan. The meap asking you questions and words you've never seen or heard before. In my opinion @ CAPS2 we are going to do meap, I would rather they ask questions and words we know. Another thing I don't like is that they rate our writings based on their opinion of what they think about it. For mi the meap is stupid @ CAPS2 I had a choice that I would choose not to. As the meap is important, I do it for my note. This is the reason why I am very hospitalized with the meap.
When i was little i was pasent i always sat and why my mom always loved her that way @ CAPS5 now feel @ CAPS1 bigger she thinks it's @ CAPS1 inpasent @ CAPS5 you what @ CAPS1 no i'm pasent i get along i'm not ancey i'm not the type when they say (when are we going yu gu) it's me when @ CAPS4 was learning to speak @ CAPS5 i guess it's like this is happening and @ TIME1 I was pagent because my mom and dad were having a conversation and I wasn't going here it was a gurorope conversation.
My mom is patient because I use her phone a lot for texting and to my girlfriend and for texting and calling friends, she tells me when I get a text or call when she needs to use it.
A time when I was patient was @ NUM1 for @ CAPS1. My mother told me that she was giving me an @ ORGANIZATION1 for @ CAPS1. So I asked her about it, she said she would get it @ DATE1 when the taxes came in so I had to be patient and wait @ NUM2 months and days. I was angry because I thought she had it. So I just had to go to school and wait and wait until @ DATE1 came. It seemed that the day was getting longer and longer. I was becoming a maker and maker which was the longest @ NUM2 month ever, didn't even know it could seem that long like this, thought a year had passed. Ater @ DATE2 eventually switched to @ DATE1 but I failed to love the end of the month which just crushed my little heart so physically to wait for something as long as I wanted so badly. When I got it it was so much fun playing all the games and apps and conquerors it was amazing. If anything were to happen to him, I would be destroyed. An @ ORGANIZATION1 is expensive, but once you have it, you have to take care of it. Therefore keep in a special place away from small children. I don't even let them play with it and if I feel hidden away they could play with my supervision, that's the only time they can play. This thing cost a lot of money to get lost or broken. Especially after all this time, I had to wait. My little sister gets something like that, but it's kind of an education. My little brother gets, a ds..I'm glad they got something they can stop asking for my stuff. My mother offers me games for my birthday. I had one, but my little brother or sister lost it. I was so angry that they couldn't play it at all. It was definitely something to look forward to and be patient with. That's why??? can play it because I'm saved from loss or bankruptcy. If so, my mom won't have another.
The first time I sat my baby down was with @ NUM1 little girls. A toddler named @ PERSON1 and a baby named @ CAPS1. After their parents left, everything was fine. That is, @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 started to cry like crazy. At first I thought she was saying "@ CAPS3, @ CAPS3!" @ CAPS4 I realized she was saying "@ CAPS5, @ CAPS5!". Her @ CAPS5 is a blanket and when I handed it to her she stopped immediately! Now I realize how patient I was with her. I'm glad I understood what she wanted. I hope next time I will be just as patient.
When I had to wait @ CAPS1 one of my most memorable moments. I had to @ CAPS1 patient was when I ordered my first cleric guitar I ordered my guitar from the areputibal guitar website my guitar teacher @ CAPS2 I waited and waited say finally j i got my guitar i took it out of @ CAPS3 and it got chipped. I was extremely angry. We sent guitar @ CAPS4 for a news about @ DATE2 I got another guitar so I opened it. It was the same guitar I sent to @ CAPS4, I was even angrier. Again we sent the guitar @ CAPS4 hoping we would finally get the right one. It was @ DATE1 and I got my guitar. I was so happy and this time it wasn't angry. I was so happy when my guitar comes and @ CAPS1 @ DATE3 ice cream which is my birthday.
Patience is a special skill for some people and others are very difficult. When I was little I never had patience and even now. I don't have either but my friend was always patient with me yeah she would tell me to hurry up or go but I would laugh and get down right away. She waited for me to pick up a stray cat and toss it in the pound, which is what she always did. Patience I will probably never lean to @ CAPS1 as an older one, but I know I will one day learn. My friend once waited @ NUM1 hours just to learn more about the story, I never would have learned that, but then again she got it ??? ???? on his homework @ CAPS2. so her patience for that was really cool and she told me patience is the number one priority. this was a time when my friend had patience.
It was a sunny day and there was a long line outside the airport. People were waiting for their flight to @ LOCATION1. It had been three hours and everyone was getting impatient, but there was a little boy in the group who didn't seem to be complaining, he was very patient. Now it must be five o'clock, their flight was delayed, the sun went down and there was a riot, but the little boy was still waiting patiently. It's been twelve hours now, people are starting to leave, it was midnight, and yet the boy was still waiting there and hasn't budged yet. Now there were only fifteen people left, it was dusk, and yet the boy waited there patiently. The flight arrived and there were only three people there. They got on the plane. The others who left saw the plane ready for take off and rushed towards it. But it was too late and the only people who got to @ LOCATION1 were the two girls and the patient boy. The end.
Patience is hard to do. Line up for something or wait for a letter in the mail. One time I had to be patient was when I thought of a great poem. I've heard of a book where you could enter your poem and then put it in the book. So I worked for a few days as hard as I could and ended up only with @ NUM1 lines. I couldn't think of anything else so I wrote the poem. It says on their website that the letter will arrive in @ NUM2 to @ NUM3 business days, so I waited a long time. One day at NUM2 months after sending the poem, I received a letter of apology for taking so long to respond. Anyway, I kept reading and he said I used the patience.
It was a day when I had to do something I didn't want to do and if I didn't, I couldn't go to the movies. When I was at my aunt's house and had to clean her house and didn't want to do it, she told me that her house should be clean when she came home and I was the only one there. When I went to point @ CAPS1 everyone did this scary ride in the sky and you have to take your shoes off so we have something to eat. The next day when everyone woke up we warmed up from the hotel and came home to have some breakfast and I didn't want to get my four-wheeled uncle down the road. hill but he had started and pushed it but I had protectors and elbow pads and gloves on my knees. When I arrived at my grandmother's. I didn't know everyone was helping but I didn't want to but my mom made me help so no one went out to play football it was a good game because I'm looking out the window at everything the match I didn't wait because I wasn't in it. Wow I was watching the soccer game out the window, the other kids ran out the door and I wasn't done with the wall
The time I was patient was today, when everyone was taking the @ CAPS1.EAP when we all walked into the classroom, no one ever wanted to take the @ CAPS1.EAP, when our teacher told us we had to write on five pages and on @ DATE1 we had to finish the second part of the writing session, no one wanted it. So when we got the package that we needed to bubble through our responses, we had to fill out something on the front of the package. Then we had to put our first and last name on it before we could take a break. At the end of the break we were to get a free reading book and our teacher was to read us all the instructions. when everyone was going she would read the other party's instructions and when everyone was doing that the same people were done very early and they were really on board and they didn't want to read so they all started talking to her would be back that she had to go to the bathroom, so once someone came in and looked at us all the guys would make paper hoop balls and start shooting them into the little basketball hoop and then she is walked in and told us to get into our seats and we were going to start the last writing session and after that it would be lunch and it might even go or have lunch and then everyone would panic. So that was the moment when I was just patient.
One time I had to be patient was when I went to my first nascar race. I had to be patient because there were a lot of people there and I didn't want to be the last. And I had to wait for the people in front to get settled. Second, we finally got our seats and I had to sit next to this scary person he was weird so the race was starting and you could tell because the riders were getting into their cars. The jets passed over us and the @ ORGANIZATION1 was leaving. Then the runners left for the race. Finally, the race started with my favorite rider in the lead (@ PERSON1). The cars were going so fast you could feel the stands shaking. It was a fun experience, but you had to stay close, listen, and be patient.
I am never a painter, but what I am is only from time to time. Sitting down and doing nothing drives me crazy. When I'm doing nothing and it's really quiet. I have a really bad headache. At school, for example, and I wait, I become rigid as if I was stamping my foot on my pencil and my desk. Press on ??? all that is like that. I have to do something or I go crazy. Waiting in a doctor's office or flying on an airplane for a while can get really boring. When I wait too long, I feel lazy and tired because I don't move at all. I go buggy when I'm paitent, and I'm waiting for something. It usually doesn't take more than @ NUM1 min (half an hour) before I get really bad. I can't be patient for very long or I'm buggy. One way to help me is to play sports and do constant things.
Patience is when a being shows the ability to wait and make good resolutions for me, patience is the ability to stay calm, patience is very important because it allows me to manage the conveniences so that I @ MONTH1 don't get in trouble: @ CAPS1 patience in times of stress is difficult. It's difficult because people blame you. without @ CAPS1 patience people make bad designs, it leads to bad things. Paitence allows me to deal with bad ideas like @ CAPS2 '@ CAPS3. using patience i can sort it out then switch to @ CAPS2 '@ CAPS3 is a really bad idea
It was the day before @ CAPS1 and I couldn't wait. In the @ CAPS5 family the day before @ CAPS1, we go to the grandparents house @ CAPS5. When we're at it, We Talk, Eat and @ CAPS5 our favorite open gifts. As mom, dad and I from @ CAPS5 made it to the grandparents house from @ CAPS5, I couldn't open the car door fast enough. I ran to the front door and rang a hundred times. "Hello @ CAPS3, @ CAPS4" said the @ CAPS5 grandfather. " @ CAPS6, can we eat fast so I can open the @ CAPS5 gifts ?" " " Yeah, sure. " @ CAPS7, we were done eating, I sprinted up the stairs as fast as I could. I couldn't wait. As I waited patiently for all of @ CAPS5's former parents to open their gifts, it was finally @ CAPS5's turn. I tore off the wrapping paper and saw what a game it was. Since it was the first gift, I had to open it quickly, but from then on I Waited patiently until it was the turn @ CAPS5.
Saw someone @ CAPS1 patient rested before me and ordered my food and it arrived. They still had no food so I left and finally they got food now I call patients.
When I was seven I played on a basketball team named @ CAPS1. We were playing @ CAPS2 for the championship and I was not in the game. My coach told me to stay on the bench this game because I was the hard-to-see @ CAPS3 player on my team. Without me my team was down @ NUM1 and my coach didn't take me to court. I knew if I kept calm and be patient ??? would have let me play. So when it was @ DATE1 with a minute to go and we were down from @ NUM2 my coach told me to go in the game and win it for us. So I walked in and there were @ NUM3 seconds left, I got the ball back and started doing all my shots. But when there were @ NUM1 seconds left and we were down @ NUM5 points, I was fouled. I had to do a technical shot, that is, when you're on the foul line and it's just you, the ball and the rim. I did my first shot with no problem but my second shot I didn't know what to do so I thought about what I had done to play in the patients game so as I got ready to shoot I Was patient with the kick to think it and when I shot it I did it after the other team got the ball to put it in, we stole the ball and won the game. If I hadn't been patient in this game, we wouldn't have won and I wouldn't have had the trophy to take home.
My mom has very little patience, that's how it surprised me when she had a whole bunch of it the day my grandmother died. I was amazed that she was sad, but she took her time carefully and slowly as if every move she made had to be perfect. It was a terrible day and all we wanted to do was cry. My mom knew my grandmother wanted her to be happy, which is why she watched her every move. As soon as I got there she came straight up to me and gave me a huge hug and no matter what my little brother and I were doing she didn't even mind. It was a very surprising day because I had never seen her in my life so sad but yet so patient.
One time I was patient was when I had my twelfth birthday. All of my friends except one wanted to keep playing. So we did. We decided to go for a walk the dogs, then have dinner, then open some presents. When we were all done with that, we opened my presints, I was very excited to see them. It is a time that I have been patient. I was very proud of myself for doing what my friends wanted to do first. Plus in the end, I got a lot of exciting things and realized I was waiting, and doing what my friends wanted to do first was a great idea. I'm pretty sure we all had a great time.
@ PERSON1 was swinging with her friend all day long when she was swinging so high the chain came off and @ PERSON1 fell she was screaming in pain. So they woke up in the house. When they got home @ PERSON1 was screaming and crying they all got in the car and went to the doctors. The nurse said she had to wait an hour to see the doctor. @ PERSON1 was not patient until she and her friend spoke. When the doctor was ready to see her she forgot why she was there, @ PERSON1 discovered that she had broken her arm. Later that day, she thanked her mother, then called her friend and thanked her for helping her be patient.
I thought when I got injured during football and I was on a stretcher, everyone was patient. They figured out I could only go with a spare cartair and waited for me in the hallways and carried my stallion from room to room. An example of someone who showed this patience was @ CAPS1 @ PERSON2 had to hurry to the bathroom but walked with me slowly so I wasn't alone. Another example of someone who is patient with me is @ PERSON1. Lauren was patient with me when I asked her…. ????????????
The I was patient. One day my mother and I went to the ophthalmologist. It was my first time there. We went to see this lady and waited for the doctor to call us. We sat for @ NUM1 minutes and then heard the doctor call my name. We go into the doctors room and I sit down, he does all these things. Later he shouts at us that we need to meet another doctor. We sat down again and waited. Then we hear my name again so we go. The worst part was that I saw a medicine on the table and I was very scared. The lady asked me to look up and open my eyes wide. After that, she took the medicine and crossed it into my eyes. I was so scared that when she ran through the medicine in my eyes, it burned me a bit. I didn't want her to do the other. I just wanted to get up and run outside, but I couldn't. She made the other eye and told me to keep my eyes closed until she came back. When she came back she told me that was it, and we were done there. I thought it wasn't that bad.
I forgot to take my helmet and ??? buffers out of my mom's car because she works up to @ NUM1 and at @ NUM2 this ??? ??? ???. Then my patience manifested itself.
Patience can mean a lot of things. It can mean being understanding or it can mean being tolerant. Being patient can also mean that you don't have a complaint. Like if you ask someone to give you something and they tell you that they will get it in a certain number of days. If they don't get it the day they said they would and you expected it, you shouldn't get mad. You can also be patient if you have to wait for something. If you buy a new pair of shoes but the only way to get them is to order them. You shouldn't start complaining if it's taking a long time. You should be able to wait without getting angry that you don't have them yet. Being patient can mean all of these things. If you do these things, you can tell that you are patient. This is what it means to be patient.
Patient, that's all I am when I go fishing. If there is one place you throw it sometimes it takes almost fifty casts just to get a bite then you have to wait for him to swallow it sometimes you have to be patient in choosing which lure you are going to use. This is because sometimes you have to be patient in choosing which lure you are going to use. This is because sometimes you have to count in the color of the water, the amount of weeds, and what the fish are eating. Then you have to have patience on the spot you are not too much because after the engine is running you have to wait for the fish to come back. So you have to have a lot of patience to go fishing.
Anna was sitting there patiently waiting, come on, come on, come on! She thought to herself, met and was very excited to perform her now improved beam routine. Anna was one of the last gymnasts to attend, only making her situation more difficult, she took a deep breath and sat patiently, waiting for her chance to shine in front of the judges.
It was @ DATE1 when I went to see the consur creed with my cousents. There must have been @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 people in front of us. Then I gathered and saw people hugging and pushing to get in. About @ NUM3 to @ NUM1 minutes later my legs started to shake but I held on. I keep telling myself: " The pain is worth it !" " Finally, we arrived at the security guards, they had to make a metle detector. When we entered the palace, I said, "She was a bride worth seeing ."
A time when I was patient. Two weeks ago @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 said @ CAPS1 is coming. @ CAPS4 grandmother was happy so she bought her sister a bus ticket. Bus tickets are very expensive. It's @ NUM1 dollar. It was a lot of money. She @ CAPS11 doesn't miss this bus because I really want to see her. I couldn't wait. So she was supposed to come on @ DATE1. She did not come. I was sick so I called @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 at his work. I said: "@ CAPS2 why hasn't @ CAPS3 come." @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 said "@ CAPS5 she's coming, just be patient." @ CAPS6, I said. The next day was @ DATE2. "@ CAPS2 is it still there," I say. "@ CAPS8, @ CAPS5 please be patient, she will be here tomorrow." "@ CAPS6, I understand." I gave up, I thought she wouldn't come. So @ CAPS4 mom called @ CAPS4 godmother. She said it was @ CAPS6. So she told me she was going to @ ORGANIZATION1. I love @ ORGANIZATION1. I so good. I asked @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2. "@ CAPS11 I have a @ CAPS12. @ ORGANIZATION2 cheeseburger. I said @ CAPS13 to @ CAPS4 uncle and @ CAPS4 mum said she wasn't coming. Told @ CAPS4 mum that I wasn't giving up not, she was coming. So I said I'm hanging up. So I'm jostling. @ CAPS4 mom said @ CAPS4 uncle @ CAPS14 "Should I get her something to eat. Thought she was lying grandma @ CAPS4. So I thought for a moment about her who is she. So I called back @ CAPS4 mom said ohh i get uncle @ CAPS14 dog food. I said, @ PERSON1's ? For a dog? She said she knew about dog food. So @ CAPS4 mom got me from the godmother's house @ CAPS4, I couldn't walk because @ CAPS4's legs, back, arm and all the parts @ CAPS11 moved @ CAPS4 was hurting my body . So grandma @ CAPS4 came to her house because we have keys. So she said where @ CAPS16? @ Uncle CAPS4 whispered something and I said it here ! I ran into uncle's room @ CAPS4 and hugged her, said how are you because when I went for my grandma's birthday @ CAPS4. She lives in South Carolina so yes. The writing is @ CAPS4. It was then that I was patient. So I could wait for @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS4 mom.
Two years ago when the first @ CAPS1 came out, my stepdad paid eight hundred dollars for one. He was so happy that all he did was brag about it to his family and friends. During this time my mom broke her phone and my step dad wouldn't let her use his sharpener. She therefore remained without a telephone for at least three months. She was a little crazy but it was worth the patience. As the newer and improved hit the stores, my mom was able to buy it. She was so happy, she had more apps than the first @ CAPS1 and a webcom. I think my mom did a good job being patient because if it was someone else they couldn't wait that long.
When I was around @ NUM1, I wanted something out of the world. You know how a girl would want a baby ball not me I don't want a rex this toy was the biggest and meanest on the plant when I was little it was. It was so cool to me that I could walk, talk, run, he could bite. Every time I went to the story I would go to the toy part of the story, I would find this rex and I would look him in the eye and say "you will be mine someday". You know how badly you don't want something and mom says a chemist is coming. When he doesn't arrive before @ NUM2 months. But I won't be doing it now not in @ NUM2 months. So I thought what can I do to get the rex before @ NUM2 months ? I understood it! I'm going to clean more, walk more in the bog, do better in school, and hopefully that will work. So I ask my mom "mom if i start doing all this good stuff can i have my chismast thing in a week @ NUM5" she said "no you just got more chismis stuff" I was so angry that I was about to cry. But @ NUM2 months was not that long. I was opening my presents in no time. but i thought i was opening all my presents i looked good once i did! But I don't see the rex I was told even though I had like @ NUM7 or more freebies. I still don't have this rex. So I walk sideways to my room. My mother came to my room with a big box. Could it be! I jumped out of bed so fast my mono can't see me. I looked in the box it was a lot of baby doll. Then she said go down for the stars and there he was rex looking so happy to see me.
"@ NUM1, @ NUM2, @ NUM3, @ NUM4, @ NUM5, @ NUM6, @ NUM7, @ NUM8!" says my pom pom trainer @ PERSON1 as we practice the dance over and over again. I love pom poms but sometimes it gets very tiring. We have the practice @ DATE1 and @ DATE3. We also have six daughters including me. My trainer loves to make us dance once by ourselves. In our first game, we practiced just before heading out for our very first performance. We were all so excited we all wanted to go play all day. But the game was at @ NUM5:45 pm and they didn't even start until @ NUM6: 00 pm which was way later than expected. So my whole pom pom team, our coach and our whole family had to wait patiently on the stands for more than @ NUM11 until we could finally play. Eventually it was the @ DATE2 and bit three of the clock, which got us all going to the track to stretch out. We were all so happy but still a little sad that we couldn't have played earlier. We had a minute on the clock so we walked to the other side. Upon entering our formation the clock quickly started to go from fifty seconds to @ NUM12, then we quickly only had @ NUM13 seconds until we continued. I couldn't believe it, only @ NUM13 seconds until our very first performance. The thrill rushed through my head when the man announced "@ CAPS1 running @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 pom pon team" and then our names over the speakers. The song roared when we entered the field. We all quickly remembered to smile. Then the music came on and we all danced with all our hearts to honor and thank our coach and parents. After we finished we were automatically crowded in with friends and family. And waiting and being patient wasn't so bad anymore. It was all worth the wait.
When dealing with toddlers or the elderly, you need to be patient. This patience is key when dealing with anyone, but the very young and the very old need more. Older people @ MONTH1 often get confused, have trouble hearing you, or are just a little slower than you. You have to practice patience and give them respect. Very young children are also sometimes confused because they are only learning. Toddlers will often be upset and refuse to do what you tell them if you have no patience with them and start screaming. Patience is also important for people with mental or physical disabilities. If they are challenged, there is no way they can help it. People with intellectual disabilities often don't understand or don't want to do things like toddlers. Be patient with people with disabilities as some @ MONTH1 tasks are difficult to accomplish. Be patient with everyone because patience is respect. Fear is not respect. This is how I feel about the word patience.
One time I was patient was when I was babysitting and the kids I babysat were having fun . I find it difficult to calm them down. But I noticed that if I was patient, they will too. So I just sat down and told them to calm down and they wouldn't. So I repeated that to them and this time they were a little calmer. I have noticed that if I ignore them or if I am patient, they will settle in and stop because they are trying to get my attention. If I was patient, I knew they would be too. It worked, they settle in and were great when I babysat them next time too.
"@ CAPS1 comes back stronger on the reighns!" my teacher shouted "@ CAPS2 trying, but he's not listening @ CAPS8 !" @ CAPS3 must have been the most stubborn horse I have ridden @ CAPS13 in my life ! @ CAPS6 did what @ CAPS6 wanted, when @ CAPS6 wanted, and paid no attention to me at all. "@ CAPS4, @ CAPS4 @ CAPS8 bring it." @ CAPS6 said I slowly brought the horse to the center of the ring. "@ PERSON1, I'm really trying, he's not listening to @ CAPS8." I said "I know @ CAPS6 can be a little stubborn but I'm making you ride it because I believe you can handle it." Horse's name @ CAPS3 was @ PERSON3, @ CAPS6 was reddish brown in color with large glassy brown eyes. @ CAPS6 looked like a big horse listening to its rider. Wrong! @ CAPS6 was neither nice nor nice and didn't listen at all ! "@ CAPS8 makes it circle several times along the perimeter." @ PERSON1 said. "@ CAPS4 good." I answered. @ CAPS8 while I was halfway in the ring, @ PERSON3 stopped. Then @ CAPS6 turned to his right, walked over to the window, and started licking the water that was beading all over it. “@ PERSON2 ! What is @ CAPS6 doing ! ” @ PERSON1 shouted “I think @ CAPS6 is licking water from the windows.” I said “@ CAPS10 get him away, @ CAPS6 might get sick!” @ CAPS4 , like i said earlier the horse @ CAPS3 has terrible listening skills ! Now I was in trouble because of him! "@ CAPS8 please be patient @ PERSON2." Guess I needed to calm down, so I relaxed a bit and continued to ride with no problem. I guess @ CAPS8 needed some patience and relaxation. Even if I do, I still never ride on this again. horse @ CAPS13.
On my way to @ LOCATION1 to visit my dad. While in the car there is food and I brought my @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS1 to keep me occupied, I brought my @ CAPS1 because it would be boring if I ask if we are already there ? " Very @ NUM1 minutes, and I knew that @ NUM2 hour drive would need some intertament. Most of the time I was playing games so the time flies, if I don't play I have a snack, I play with my babies, @ PERSON1, and I sleep. After a while, I sit down and relax. The whole trip is @ NUM2 hours but doing all this it looks more like @ NUM4 or @ NUM5 hours.
Patience is all about waiting for it and tolerating it. Every year on @ MONTH1 @ NUM1, my family becomes seasonal in a campground. There @ CAPS1 plays and has fans and makes many lifelong friends. Every weekend @ CAPS1 goes there and @ CAPS1 takes his speedboat, "the glass of". @ CAPS1 pats him in the lake and ties him to a dock. Then @ CAPS1 goes fishing all parts of the lake and sits there for six hours. This is where patience comes in @ CAPS1 has to sit and watch the oar floats float on the glass as smooth as a lake. @ CAPS1 sits there, watches, talks and bakes in the sun. It's quite peaceful because I'm not at school and I @ CAPS2 to spend time with my parents. Then at school I have to wait until the year is over and be patient so that the year can be over. So @ CAPS1 stays there until the sudden sound of one of our floats sinking into the water. After that, there are shouts and sayings "@ CAPS2 the net". The funny. The part is that it is that it is ethier a big bass or a small one. And all of this takes patience.
My teddy dog is very impatient because when he comes home from the outside he receives a treat, but he has to wait for the other dogs to come home
A @ DATE1 @ TIME1 I was very patient waiting for my sister-in-law to tell my brother to tell us that we could come to the hospital room and see their brand new baby @ CAPS1. My dad and mom were waiting with my sister, bother and me, in the waiting room / lobby. Back then, you probably had to wait an hour and a half. I guess I could tell I was patient. Also very ten to fifteen minutes I had to get up and walk around. I was so nervous and nervous. But it probably didn't help that I drank three cans of pepsi and just before rushing out when I was patient.
Patience for me is a personal thought that turns into action. I have been patient many times before. I used to go to the store on the corner of my block. I had to stand in a long line that actually went halfway to my block. I went to get my things and I went to the end of the line. Half an hour later and it was five minutes before closing. I get to the window and pay for my stuff @ NUM1 minute before closing time. In fact, I was standing in line without doing anything. The store owner allowed me to get a total of @ NUM2 things for free. I got half of the stuff I wanted and the other half was household stuff. So being patient really pays off and can unlock a lot of different treasures. So start running with patience and put impatience behind you.
Well, you need patience when you fish and when your food arrives or is going to be served, but also be patient with everyone.
Just as I was finishing eating my burger, I noticed an old crass excuse for a bus parked outside the restaurant window. "@ CAPS1 is that it?" I asked through my squeky seven-year-old voice. My @ CAPS3 replied, "This bus takes people to the palace across the street, where @ PERSON1 is playing." "@ CAPS2 wouldn't it be cool if we @ CAPS4 go?" I questioned. I saw my mother whisper something to my brother. That's when they told me we were going to the show. Enthusiastically, I got into the back seat of our car and we walked across the street to @ ORGANIZATION1's palace. It was huge! All I wanted to do was walk into the wonderful building, but my @ CAPS3 kept telling me we had to wait. About fifteen minutes later, the two pepsis I had drunk earlier went through my "@ CAPS3, I need to go to the bathroom," I say over and over. Finally, my @ CAPS3 got me through the front doors. The interior of the building was even more fabulous than the exterior! However, a red rope rail blocked our way. "@ CAPS4 my son uses the toilet?" my @ CAPS3 asked a lady who was sitting behind the reception. She gave a cold "ro" and we were forced to return to the car. Another quarter of an hour passed. The concert was going to start soon, so we went back to the building. This time, the red rope had disappeared, but replaced by a line of nearly fifty people who were all waiting to pass the metal detector! It took almost @ NUM1 minutes, but we got to the front line, walked through the metal detector and took our seats. It was a real test of my patience, but it was worth it when I was finally allowed to use the bathroom.
I was patient when I went to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1. It all started when I got a can from my friend @ PERSON1, he asked me to go. So I said yes. I was to be pation derms on @ DATE1. Then he drove for a long time but I was pation. When we got to the entrance, I felt good to be pation.
Once upon a time there was a place called unpaciente land. But on the cranky lane lived a little girl named @ ORGANIZATION1. She was the most patient girl ever. One day, @ ORGANIZATION1 went to have her hair cut "at the mtso fast saloon!" When @ ORGANIZATION1 came up everyone was shouting on @ CAPS1 the haircut and @ ORGANIZATION1 stood up and said ok if you want your hair to look good just sit and be quiet and everyone has it do. @ ORGANIZATION1 went home with a nice haircut like everyone else, then @ ORGANIZATION1 because the mayor of unpaciente land renamed him @ CAPS2 land from that day on, everyone was patient.
A time when I was patient A time when I was patient was when I went to the doctor with my mother-in-law and my brother. He had his knee examined; @ CAPS1 was in this waiting room for about two or three hours ! Jody (my mother-in-law) was getting really irritated, I told her the doctor was coming out soon. I was very patient, @ CAPS2 and @ PERSON1 were playing with their phone. This kind of relaxation made @ CAPS2 relax because usually I'm not very patient, usually everyone tells @ CAPS2 that I'm really impatient. For some reason, when I'm really excited I'm pretty patient. I was delighted to see if he could remove his knee brace. Sure enough he did, he was so happy that two hours was worth it! It was a time when I was patient.
I was patient once. It was December @ NUM1 @ DATE1 @ CAPS1 the day before. I was so excited that @ CAPS1. The morning before @ CAPS1 I slept until @ NUM2 I want it ?? To come. I was patient so I played video games without thinking about @ CAPS1. When I went to the store I saw all the @ CAPS1 things. I felt like I couldn't wait any longer. That night after dinner I found out that I wanted to stay instead of going to bed early so that @ CAPS1 would come faster. A small part of me wanted to go to sleep, but I also wanted to stay up. I prepared a little more food and I went for sleep. In the morning I was so happy that I ran into the living room. Indeed, there were the gifts. My mom and dad were still sleeping. I decided to look at some @ NUM3 came and wanted to open them then ??? I knew it wouldn't be good so I fell asleep ??? At noon I woke up and ran into the living room. My mom and dad and my brother were there, I opened my presents like a lion feasting on a gazelle, I was so happy that I waited.
When I was patient, I had no fear, no argument, but I had a good deal. I had a @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 was so good my sister @ PERSON1 said "@ CAPS2 get some" I said "@ CAPS3 you @ CAPS2" @ CAPS4 was a miracle so I was driving her car to the gas station. I went to @ ORGANIZATION1. wow "@ PERSON1 called my phone because @ CAPS4 was my dad's weekend she said" come down there now I was like wow.
A time when I had to be patient was on my way to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1 took a few hours so here is the story of @ CAPS2. We were leaving the house when I realized I had forgotten something. I quickly ran inside to retrieve @ CAPS2 dog penny [it's true, not false] @ CAPS2 dog bit through the door and put it in the truck. We stopped by the grandmothers and grandfathers house @ CAPS2 and had a rest. We traveled many roads until we came to the highway. “@ CAPS1 is going to be a long ride,” I said. We passed so many cars. Then they passed us. For a second, we lost our grandparents' car. I looked back and behind a dozen cars I found them. We reached @ LOCATION3 in about four hours. I knew @ CAPS1 was going to be a long trip so I decided to take a nap. Bold @ CAPS2 nap @ CAPS2 parents [@ CAPS2 mom] took pictures of me. I thought @ CAPS1 was not nice. We now have one more state to go through, then we were in @ LOCATION1. This state was @ LOCATION2. By the time we reached @ LOCATION2 @ CAPS1 was already @ NUM1. We decided to have a room like a hotel. In the morning we stopped and had breakfast. Then back on the road. I had to be patient because we still had two hours to go. Longest five hours even, but I was patient so @ CAPS1 was fine. We arrived at @ LOCATION1 and had no idea where we were going. So @ CAPS2 daddy turned his gos around and we found our way to our cabins. This is the story of a time when I had to be patient.
There are a couple of times I've been patient @ CAPS1 this time around, my little sister kept bugging me, and I didn't yell at her or hit her. She asked me to turn on the music and I said "no", she had a fit. So I got up and picked her up, and told her to stop before she was touched, in a nice, kind voice. And she stopped. And I told him to sit down and shut up and watch TV. In conclusion, this was a time when I was patient with my little sister, not yelling at her or hitting her when she was destroying me. I didn't turn into a mean person then. Last but not least, it was a time when I was a patient person.
Patience for me is when I help others with their problems, so in this story I'm going to describe to you what patience is. Patience is when you are ready to sit down and help someone with their own issues. I have a lot of patience because I sit all the time and help people with their problem. One day in my old school @ PERSON1 this girl was having very difficult problems at home. When she got to school, she was crying. I went to ask him what was wrong. She said she didn't want to be home because her mom wouldn't let her go anywhere, she always had to stay home and watch her two brothers. So I sat with her all day and left her feeling like she had someone to talk to for once in her life. As we chatted, she seemed to feel a lot better and felt like she had a true friend. In conclusion, I really felt like I had patience and since that day I have sat down and let people talk to me about their problems.
There was a time when I was patient all day! It was the day before @ CAPS1 and it was pretty much at @ NUM1 meaning I just woke up having breakfast brushing my teeth after getting out of the shower. By now, I probably would have asked my mom @ NUM2 once if I could open a gift, but that day I hadn't asked her @ CAPS6 once yet. I was playing at my playstation when my mom called @ CAPS2 !!!! I open my door and as usual my cat was right at my door I close my door jump over my cat comes to the stairs then yells for food. He sewn down the stairs and up to the gallop. As I start to go down the stairs I hear a @ CAPS3 !! So I set off down the stairs as fast as I could, knowing that my two @ NUM3 year old brothers were coming. They meet @ CAPS7 at the counter and ask @ CAPS7. “ Has @ CAPS4 often asked you to open a gift ? " " @ CAPS5 "I said. It looked like they had both seen a ghost. After lunch I ran to my friend's house across the street to play basketball. About an hour later, we finish our game and take a bike ride. We came back about @ NUM4 to @ CAPS2 about @ NUM5 minutes later, I was done looking @ CAPS6.V. take a shower and then go to bed. My mom woke up @ CAPS7 to @ TIME1 and we are getting warm on the stairs and as soon as I saw the whole gift I screamed @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 !!!! And that's when I waited a whole day.
"@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2" said my little sister @ PERSON1 "@ CAPS3 you help me practice kicking a soccer ball, we do it in the gym and I @ CAPS6 don't know how." "Sure", I said "Let's go to the back yard" @ CAPS4 on the way out, I catch a ball. I put it @ CAPS4 on the floor in front of me and I say "@ CAPS5 you step forward with your left foot and kick with the top of you to the right. " I'm going to try @ CAPS8, say " a mocking tone. @ CAPS8 runs to the ball and gives a kick, he misses but CAPS7 @. @ CAPS8 still trying another dud. @ @ CAPS4 CAPS8 sits on the ground. I m approach her. "@ CAPS6 doesn't give second try, not everyone is good at football, try one more time. " @ CAPS7, one more try. " @ CAPS8 runs to the ball and gives kicks. The ball will sail into the goal. "@ CAPS9 you for teaching me @ CAPS2." "It was a pleasure for me to try to be patient with yourself and you will be a great football player, I promise. " " @ CAPS7 but I want to practice some more. " " @ CAPS7. "
The patient is when you are understanding and tolerant. Many parts of life are accomplished with patience, for some things are worth waiting for @ CAPS1 is always a time and place for everything, and getting there is done with the great virtue of patience.
We had been fairly patient on the plane ride to @ ORGANIZATION1. We had been patient at check-in. Now was the time for a real test of patience. We sat at a table in a hotel restaurant. Our waitress came over, ordered our drinks and food, and then disappeared. We had our drinks and waited for our meal @ NUM1 min, @ NUM2 min. @ NUM3, @ NUM4, @ NUM5 min. after an hour we called her and asked for some bread. And there she is, she brings bread! We ask him where our food is. She promises to get it out right away. We expect to have waited @ NUM6 hours. We call the manager to complain and he takes the food out a minute later. After @ NUM6 hours of patience, we finally had our food.
Once I was patient was when my mom and dad and big brother were going @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. We had to pack up and leave in an hour? wanted to leave him for a room and colors and ??? packed and ??? the ??? so then ? during his long journeys none? ? ? I decided to put my head down and wait for a hot one? I'm heading down so I dream the lines do n't have lines so I can get on all of them? in a hungry as i'm about to take a ride i smelled someone ? ? savings were born when I was earning light it was my brother ? ? shaking a I got up ? ? … .I knew her when a big old sign said welcome to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. After all this sleep, it got bored after all. so since i think there are no lines i was heartbroken. The lines were as long as having to @ LOCATION1 himself something told me it was going to be a long wait. As I got patient I started drawing someone grabbed me, it was my mom. She said why are you in the mood I said because these lines are san just be patient it will be worth the wait that's what I did. Finally our turn so I got on and she was right to be patient in the queue was worth the wait and it was so much more fun to get on. So, since I think there are no lines, I was heartbroken. The line was as long as having something @ LOCATION1 himself tell me it was going to be a long wait. As I became patient I started to draw someone who caught me, it was my mom. She said why are you telling me because these lines are the sant just be patient it will be worth the wait thats what i did. Finally our turn so I got on and she was right to be patient in line was worth the wait and it was so much fun going up
It was @ DATE1 when my family and I went to Cedar Point. It was really exciting and fun. The trip lasted about three or six hours. I fell asleep but when I woke up we were at Burger King. I ordered a children's meal and it was good. so when we got back in the car, I stood the rest of the way. Then I started to see water parks and hotels, it was really cool. Then I saw this really high roller coaster. I was really excited to run to the line, bed they were all long. I waited @ NUM1 minutes. When I felt like I was so happy and excited that when I got my tampon I ran to the roller coaster @ CAPS1- @ CAPS2 in the doorway . So I had to wait an hour in line, so I'm really tired, but I kept on mowing before, when I got to the stairs finally I got on the ride. I was scared at one point because it was dark. then we took off then it took off I was dissy, but I went for another round and I had to talk. I got on this merry-go-round which rocks from side to side. This is the time when I was patient.
I stood in line for @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1 I complained, “@ CAPS2 ! When are we going to the park ?”. “@ CAPS3 patient,” @ CAPS9's mother hissed. “ Being patient is boring ! I complained again " yeah " @ CAPS9's sister yelled. "@ CAPS4 so bored! It's not and @ CAPS9 feels hurt and-" @ CAPS5! '' Shouted @ CAPS9 @ CAPS2. "We are almost there!" @ CAPS6 @ CAPS8 seemed to be hours, we @ CAPS7 got to the ticket booth. "@ CAPS7!" I wanted to say. We went inside the park. "@ CAPS8 first?" I asked sister @ CAPS9 for a spin. "That one!" @ CAPS9's sister screamed the night before she ran for a ride. We followed @ CAPS9's sister to the ride. “@ CAPS10, let's go to @ CAPS12. Sounds fun.” @ CAPS9 daddy said as we walked to the queue. “@ CAPS11 ! No more waiting ! " I shouted "@ CAPS12 is going to take forever!" I complained.
I have been patient before. I'm about to tell you and this time. Two years ago. I worked at my @ CAPS1 to get ???. Working there is difficult because it makes you do so much work. I have all the ??? grass cut to its harness, cut wood and a lot of m ???. After about seven hours of hard work I asked my @ CAPS1 if I could have my money back. He ??? him when I asked why he told me. He gave my uncle a lot of money for the holidays. My heart sank. I asked him when I was going to have him. He shook his head as if he had no idea. Rage invaded her even to me. One week ??? I went back to ??? house to ask ??? because I really wanted to buy something. He shook his head no. My mind said patience but my body said no patience. I listened to my mind. Really expect unk but I knew patience was the right thing to do. Patience brings opportunity. Three weeks later. He still hasn't got my money back. I heard someone knocking on my door. I moved there. It was my @ CAPS1. He came in with a huge smile on his face. Suddenly he opened my hand and gave me twenty dollars! "@ CAPS1 is more than double," I said, heart pounding. "I know but you deserve it." I was shocked to hear my @ CAPS1 say this. That day, I showed patience. It really felt good to have patience because I made so much money. Think about my story the next time you don't want to be patient because it just might pay off.
When I was about nine years old. I took my homework home with me. I showed one of my older brothers my homework. He looked at it and then started to help me. Then he made some answers. To show me what to do because I wasn't sure how to do my homework. So he had to do his homework so he told me to do my homework at home. So I started doing my homework, answered all my questions correctly. But that was a really tough question about it. I wanted to ask my older brother. But instead, I didn't do it because it was doing its job. So I did it myself.
Middleton middle school, I am one of their students. My name is @ CAPS1, I'm new here, but you @ MONTH1 think I'm a boy. Well if you better listen and listen carefully @ CAPS16 I'm not going to say it twice ; patience is a vulture. On the first day I walked into @ PERSON1's class, I sat next to a girl with wavy blonde hair, sparkling blue eyes, and a genuine smile. "@ CAPS2." @ CAPS3 said. "My name is @ CAPS4." @ CAPS3 said in a cheerful voice. "@ CAPS2." I say back. "I am @ CAPS6, but you can call me @ CAPS1." "@ CAPS8, uh @ CAPS1." @ CAPS4 responded. "@ CAPS11 let me show you around." "@ CAPS12 !" I answered. @ CAPS4 and I became quick friends, but when @ CAPS3 introduced me to their friends they all laughed at me for having a boy's name. @ CAPS4 yelled at them, but I said @ CAPS13 was @ CAPS17. @ CAPS4 just wouldn't let @ CAPS13 go. Finally, I told him: “@ CAPS13's @ CAPS17 @ CAPS4! Just let me handle this. "@ CAPS15 ?" @ CAPS3 asked crossing his arms and stamping his foot like @ CAPS3 did when @ CAPS3 couldn't do the same. "@ CAPS16, you just have no patience !" I said, getting a little angry @ CAPS3 couldn't understand. "@ CAPS17 be like this @ CAPS1 !" @ CAPS3 said as he left the room. "@ CAPS4 wait !" I cried but I want to run after her. "@ CAPS20, please you don't get @ CAPS13. You can't keep blaming them for laughing at me. I know you are trying to protect me, but it's @ CAPS17 . Have you ever had patience before? I asked to be ready to go if @ CAPS3 ran away from me. "@ CAPS21." @ CAPS3 said, looking at the scuffed floor. Then I told him everything I knew about @ CAPS13 and we never had a problem again.
I was going to tennis with my @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2, my younger brother, @ PERSON1 and my grandfather and grandmother, whom I call @ LOCATION1 and @ ORGANIZATION1. @ CAPS6 where I was driving in different cars with @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 in @ CAPS1 white mersadies. @ PERSON1 was with @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ LOCATION1 in @ LOCATION1's golden van. The windows in our car were down and @ CAPS1 and I smelled like burnt rubber. @ CAPS6 was in front of @ LOCATION1, as @ CAPS6 was slowing down @ LOCATION1 approached us and told us to stop. @ CAPS6 stopped @ CAPS2 got out, took a bok and said "@ CAPS6 is leaking trans fluid." @ CAPS6 went to town with @ LOCATION1 following us. @ CAPS6 stopped in a store autin @ CAPS6 were the only people present, the mucanic told us to take out everything @ CAPS6 needed from the car. After @ CAPS6 cleaned the car, he pulled the car onto the elevator and that when I first saw the note. It smelled like gas, everything was greasy and dirty (including the mucanics). “@ CAPS7 is going to ruin our trip,” I told @ CAPS2, “@ CAPS6 isn't sure,” he replied. It was so hard to sit down and be patient. I went back and forth between the Minny van and the rank for about two hours. Some of the other mocaniques also came, but no one could find out what was wrong with our car. @ CAPS2 went to the computer they had there and looked for car parts, it didn't help. The day before @ CAPS6 left, @ CAPS1 had taken his car to @ CAPS10 gardge for a check-up. @ CAPS6 was not sure. After sitting at the store for about three hours I got hungry, so did everyone so @ CAPS6 went to a restaurant across the street for loneh. @ CAPS2 stays in the store a little longer than the rest of us. At lunch, @ CAPS2 said “ were going to have to call triple A to come and pick up our car. @ CAPS6 will have to go home !! I was so upset, after all @ CAPS7 waiting for @ CAPS6 to go home. As I left the restaurant, I tripped and landed on my rist. I sprained myself so @ CAPS6 went back across the street and behind the audio store was a wallmart so @ CAPS6 stopped there, took a bandage for my wrist and chose a book to buy. I have the vampire diaries, @ PERSON1 has a Starwars book. @ CAPS6 read them on the wag home in the car @ CAPS12.
When I went deer hunting with my dad, I was patient. When my dad and I went deer hunting I had to be skating while waiting. The hardest part was being silent. I also had to stay still. To be skated is to expect something. I must have been skating because I was waiting for a deer all day. Even now I didn't have a deer, I was calm, still, and skated.
Finally, all these months of waiting are coming to an end! My mom is going to give me a cell phone! Even if it was her old one, it will be new to me, I can talk to my friends whenever I want. I @ MONTH1 am not getting the services I want, but at least I'll have to stop worrying about being late for my appointments. Like I said, the wait is almost over. Okay so I'm not the most patient person in the world, but it's worth it! See, I go into track, cross country, and choir. As I am driving home by bus and all these activities end well after the buses have left, I need someone to come and pick me up. For this I need a cell phone. My mother said that first I must be thirteen. Second, she needs to transfer everything to her new phone. Finally, I have to prove that I am groomed, that I can keep my notes, and that I am responsible enough to have one. I turned thirteen at @ DATE1, she transferred everything, I proved I hated, I kept my notes, now I just have to prove I'm responsible. To do this, I have watched the neighbor's animals while they were away, mowed their lawns, helped babysit their grandchildren, and I work to clean and keep the house clean. So far, I have succeeded in convincing my father and my grandmother that I am responsible. Even my brother and half-sister thinks I should have a cell phone! But my mother is still not sure. I think if I can clean half the house and keep it clean until @ CAPS1, she'll finally give me her old cell phone. I'll probably have to clean up the mess after @ CAPS1 too. When I have a cell phone, I will have to continue whatever I am doing now. So I won't be off the hook or anything, but I will have a little more freedom! I still have a long way to go but it will be worth it in the end. I will finally have my own cell phone!
Patience is reported. Because if you don't have patience, you won't get that far in life. If you don't have patience, you won't miss Pepol at all. And you don't have patience, you won't be able to do stuff.
@ CAPS2's story is about when @ CAPS2's mother ran out of gas. @ CAPS2 mom was driving to @ LOCATION1 @ NUM1 on her way home. Soon we started to run out of gas. The worst part is that it was raining. Then we ran out of gas. First she had to ask someone to slip in and ask if he had a cell phone. Someone finally did. She asked if they could get gas. Everyone said "@ CAPS1 !" @ CAPS2 mom then decided to call @ CAPS2 dad and ask him to refuel. He then shows up an hour later with a few gallons of gasoline. It was just enough to bring @ LOCATION1 home. If @ CAPS2 mom had the patience of @ CAPS1, she would have gone mad.
One day when I was camping with my friend @ PERSON1 I asked him if we could climb the dunes and he said we would do it later. So I waited for hours and hours and hours and hours and then he said end our lunch. Then I asked him after lunch and he said yes. But when we saw the dunes I knew it was a bad idea for me to climb it but I did. After reaching the top. I fell and @ CAPS1 just stood there like a dead animal. After five minutes I was fine and I climbed to the top of the dune because after I got up I ran into the dune and when my friend told me to stop I m 'stop, I stopped. But I have seeds in my coat pocket. Then I hit a rock and did a front flip. Then I fell, when my friend got off we both cried and @ CAPS2 went back to our campsite.
My name is @ CAPS1 and I am writing about a time when I had to be patient. It was a beautiful @ DATE1 @ TIME1 to @ DATE2, it was the eighteenth and we were going to be heading to @ LOCATION1 for a vaction that we were going to @ CAPS2 to land. Everyone was in the hold of the house, packing everything in a hammer that we had hired for the trip so everyone could fit in the car. We had everything packed in the car. My made us a good breakfast. A hearty meal of sasauge pancakes, bacon and scalded eggs. That was delicious. After that we got in the car and we were on the highway. I fell asleep an hour after the start of the trip. It was now ten in the evening and I woke up. My sister was yelling at my brother and then my sister and I got the urge I told everyone to stop and we did but we were all on edge. And I had to be patient for another two days but we got there and I was happy to be there so overall it was a pleasure until we had to go back.
I was on the farm waiting for my dad to come home so I could drive my wheeled vehicle. Then later that night he called me telling me he would be arriving later than expected. He returned home three hours later. This meant I had to drive my four wheeler tomorrow because nobody was home except my grandma, my dad doesn't want me to drive my four wheeler when my dad or uncle @ PERSON1 is not not theirs. At that time, I was hospitalized. The next day my dad called me to tell me that he had to work late again so that I could no longer ride. I was even more impatient but my uncle @ PERSON1 showed up and I asked him if I could drive my four wheeler and he told me I could if my dad said it was @ CAPS1. So I called my dad and he told me it was @ CAPS1 if my uncle @ PERSON1 said it was okay with him. Then I was able to drive my four-wheeler, and I was no longer impatient.
Hunting has patience. You cannot hunt a deer. You have to do. Because the deer don't come to you. Deer don't like people, so deer have come to smell you. If you don't wait, you won't get anything.
Last year I had to sell my cow because she was sick. I have a bell weight for eight months to have a new calf but I did not get them where I would have one until I asked my uncle who takes care of the purebred little witch cow from @ CAPS1, nor mail charges @ MONEY2 but he gave me a deal on it for @ MONEY1. It took me eight months to fine him. But I dared those eight months, I got stubborn and couldn't sleep very well when I brought her home, I was glad I found her when I did. I always worry about her at night because of the cougar inhabiting the awkward side.
Do you sometimes like to stand in line at the store? Well, me neither ??? Well, I'm going to tell you about a time when I was hospitalized and patient. Every morning I have to take the bus to school. I usually get to the @ NUM bus stop 1 min earlier so I can talk to my mom ??? Try I got up early. I got to the bus stop early. ??? @ NUM2 min later I decided to go home. By the time I got home, I was going to be late. I rushed to the door, but I was too late, the bus was gone. I should have more patience. The day I was going to make a burger ??? was to get a burger with bacon cheese and a toaster. When I got theirs there was the peace of @ NUM3 in theirs, so I decided to wait my turn online like I did later. I was there, people paid from the cash register. I was finally their I ordered my burger when I was done it was worth the wait. In conclusion, you need to be patient in whatever you do. In sports, at school or at home and even in public, I hope my story has made you realize how important it is to be patient.
Once I was patient it was at @ DATE1 at @ ORGANIZATION1. I was about @ NUM1 in @ TIME1 when we claimed our seats right in front of the stage. We waited about @ NUM2 minutes until the first @ PERSON1 came on stage, their @ PERSON1's name was @ LOCATION2. They looked strange so they looked like a rock @ PERSON1. But it was just a regular @ PERSON1 playing normal music. They played songs that I have never heard of but now I hear them more frequently now. The second bad was another one I had never heard of. I don't remember their names, but they weren't my musical taste. The next @ PERSON1 was one that I talked about a lot ; their name is @ PERSON1, they were awesome. There, the lead singer had a long bearded man and an afro, it was very funny. They seemed to go the fastest because I liked them so much. Then there was another singer I heard about his name was @ PERSON2 he was awesome too. He even composed a song on top of his head about @ LOCATION1 and never stopped for about four minutes. Then it was done and it was now around @ NUM3 @ CAPS1 at night. And I was starting to tire. But then I saw the boys from @ CAPS2 getting ready, I was really excited, they started with a song called @ CAPS3. And there were strobe lights and regular lights everyone. The stilted man holding the drum even moved. He made @ NUM4 ?, and a @ NUM5. He went to @ NUM2 feet in the air and did some flips and all you can @ CAPS4. Their singer @ PERSON3 and their drummer even had a drum sound, that was cool. It lasted until about @ NUM7, it was amazing. I will probably never whitewash something like this again!
Being patient is sometimes difficult but easy for others. Like @ CAPS1 for example. I always wake up very early in the morning from @ CAPS1 and lie down on the couch. Same with my brother. We get up to @ NUM1 am and light up the @ CAPS1 tree. Then our eyes light up because we lose all the gifts we manage to open. First we lay down on the couch and looked at them, trying to figure out what we had. Then we find another chair and look at them from a different angle. We do this until we both end up on the couch. We are immediately called or two to go back to bed. But it's no use because we never do. Then around @ NUM2 am we start to get gosy. We go to our rooms and try to find something to not think about it, but it never works. Then we return to the sofa. Around @ NUM3 am we go to our kitchen and make coffee for our mom and dad because they say they always need coffee before opening the presents. then we'll wake them up. When they finally get out of bed, we rush them over to drink their coffee so we can see what we have. Finally, about @ NUM4 min later, they finish and let us open our presents. It took so long, but it pays off in the end.
When I was patient I was in the car and my mom went to get something from the store and I went with her. I was patient because I didn't tell her when are we coming home or it's boring @ CAPS1. I tried to go with the flow. I was there for @ NUM1 hour but I didn't care because I was the one who wanted to come and I came. If I had complained, then she would have said "why did you come". @ CAPS1 at the end my mom said since you have been patient you can get a chocolate bar @ CAPS1 if your patient there might be a reward at the end.
When I was very patient it took two hours for my time to have my teeth pulled out, they were taking a break of about @ NUM1 minutes every half hour. I had received many injections in my mouth. And they tore out my gum and took out two teeth. Then my two lower teeth. I was a patent at the time. They even said I was one of the best kids because of everything I put in my mouth and the long panke. That's when I got my teeth pulled @ NUM2 and I was very patient.
" When can I drive ? " I drank. “When the time comes, you have to be patient or else you won't be shouting my @ CAPS1 over the loud, heartwarming sound of @ CAPS2. Started for the @ NUM1 time that year. I loved this sound. This is my second favorite sound. The vibrations that vibrate my delays as he walks away with @ PERSON1 driving. I could wait my turn. After that I roll up and @ NUM2 minutes. @ CAPS1 said the words I thought he would never say, "@ CAPS3, your turn." I looked at him and then the truck. Wow he looks small next to this truck. I ran as fast as I could to the pit. I climbed on the rim of the tires, then on the top of the tire and into the cab. "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6, gag @ CAPS7. Oh yeah! That felt right to me. I couldn't go fast but I almost knocked it over. So that's a good thing. So all in a nat shell, pacons has come a long way.
I don't have much patience, but I'll tell you a story about a time when I did. It was a sunny day outside and it was @ DATE1 after school and I had no homework. So I invited my friends over and we were going to the landslide skate park. We were all at home but @ CAPS1 was not. My mom said "@ CAPS2 he's not here in two minutes, we have to go without him." So I was angry to write a note on the door that said "@ CAPS1, we had to leave without you because you were late!" Sorry to be on time next time.-@CAPS4 ”. But when I signed the note, he stopped. It was history when I had patients.
Once at @ DATE1, I took a test called @ ORGANIZATION1 (@ CAPS1). My friends and I met the @ ORGANIZATION1 early on. So we also had to be patient. There was a lot that we could do, but the choices were limited. Being patient is hard sometimes it feels like ages have passed but really @ NUM1 minutes have passed sometimes patience requires a lot of peace of mind. Once my dad and I were going to work at @ LOCATION1. The bus was NUM2 minutes late, but it looked like a few weeks. Sometimes patience is good and bad. Good patience is when a team scores a goal, the audience has been patient enough for the team to score a goal. Bad patience is when you're late for work, and traffic, or the bus was late, or you could wait. Sometimes you can distract yourself while being patient, texting, calling a friend, talking or playing a game, with a child or with yourself. So you see that patience can be good or bad, it also requires a lot of mental peace. @ ORGANIZATION1.
When I was about the age of @ NUM1. I went to @ CAPS1 with my grandpa, grandma, mom and dad for a family reunion, we stopped by so many times I can't even count. I think it was but I didn't want to stop or be patient because I wanted to get there and see what everything looked like like it was big but daddy's post was that we had to let our dog out. home for a week, was patient going home because as soon as I got home I was going to sleep. We got up to leave our house at @ TIME1 and got to the motel at @ TIME2 am in the afternoon, I was sick of sitting in the car, didn't want to go back to the car to go home because if you think about it is a long time to do white in the car. I was very impatient because if I could have made it in half an hour or an hour would have been a lot better than like, @ NUM2 hours of time but it was great fun seeing new things that you did never seen before going because on the way back. I was just sleeping. But I was not very patient, I was so carried away that at each stop, I changed cars and I had no tating at that time, but I had my @ CAPS2 until he died , then i did my i pod and cells all i could do was call and play games on it but i was so eager to coner to make the buzz i preferred to go to hotel and sleep than sitting there listening to the elderly talk about what happened. I hardly know any of them, I couldn't tell you who each was.
I was patient this time while waiting to go to the computers and told my mom to wake me up if she grabbed the computer and after an hour I fell asleep and woke up after a little while and my brother was on for three hours reading the manag we already have and after three minutes my dad kicked me to check his emails and he said he would be gone soon but he got spent the rest of the day more successful the next day staring at the indearath star (for six hours even though he spends eight hours logging in at work, which adds @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 hours on the internet every day of the year.
There was this guy I really liked and finally had the courage to ask after @ NUM1 years and @ NUM2 ½ weeks. He said yes to go to the ball with me but no to go out. So a little later, like a week later, I asked him again. He told me to give it to him until the end of the week. So I waited and waited and so on, it seemed like an eternity to me. Then my friend just couldn't take it, she asked him for @ DATE1 and he said yes! A million yes, joy came out of his mouth. Then @ DATE2, after getting to know me better, he broke up with me. We've been fighting ever since, but we were still the best!
Being patient is difficult and not everyone is patient, but patience is an important thing to do. You have to be patient almost everywhere you go, like standing in line is being patient. You have to be patient with people, like the people who are learning or whom you are teaching. I was patient in @ ORGANIZATION1 which was really hard to do. When I was really four or five we went to @ ORGANIZATION1. My older sister wanted to take a ride but couldn't go because I was too small. So my mom stayed with me while my older sister and my @ CAPS1 went around. I was so sad but my mom told me to wait and not to get upset. After a while I started asking "When is the ride going to be over mom" she kept saying "I don't know, every time @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS1 go down of the journey. " @ CAPS2 I couldn't wait but when my @ CAPS1 and my sister came downstairs they told my mom they wanted to go back. My mom said "ok" and that's when I got sad, then she said "but because you've waited so long and kindly I'm going to take you for a smoothie ". “ I like smoothies, ” I yell. Patience is important, because I was so patient that my mother gave me something that I love. Patience is a hard thing to do, but once you have it, it's a good thing to do.
Last year I went to the doctor for a normal exam where she tested my eyesight and hearing and also felt the cold. She put my chest up to see if my heart was @ CAPS1.K. After that she checked my neck. I could feel her icy fingers on my neck about a minute had passed and she said she would come back right away. Another doctor walked in and smelled it until finally my mom asked "what's going on here." They said the glands in my neck were full and they said I need to have my blood checked to see if I have a theroid i.e. glands in your neck that are full which requires you to take pills for the rest of your life. So a few days later, we went for a blood test. While we were waiting I started to get really nervous I had some really bad butterflies then @ NUM1 minutes went by what seemed like an hour they called me and I sat down the nurse said everything would be fine. So I trusted her, she took a rubber tube and tied it around my arm, it hurt a bit like a pinch then @ NUM2… @ NUM3… @ NUM4… and the needle went in and j saw the blood enter the tube really cool so we went home. It took a week with sleepless nights because I was so anxious and they called my mom which took about a year. not wanting to run over there and see me!
" When did you get the xbox !" " I asked @ CAPS1. “@ CAPS2 hours,” he replied. "@ CAPS3 !" "Yes." "@ CAPS4." "@ CAPS4." @ CAPS2 hours…. I thought, it'll look like a week. First of all, I got on the computer. After ten minutes I went down because nothing was ???. Then I watched the TV guide. Nothing. Why am I so tired! I thought. It must be that I did…, I thought but luckily I fell asleep. I woke up. There are four hours left. Again, I watched the tv guide still nothing. I just turned on the TV. A @ PERSON1 has just ended. “@ CAPS7, the next in the @ CAPS8 field is The @ PERSON1,” the @ CAPS8 ad said. “@ CAPS10 see this,” I said out loud. It turned out better than I expected. It was a colorless @ PERSON1 that concerned a police officer and his son. After watching four hours of @ PERSON1, I heard the front door open. I heard @ CAPS1 come in and say, "@ CAPS12 got it !" @ CAPS13 then I said "@ CAPS14" then fell asleep. "@ CAPS15 wakes him up." @ CAPS1 whispered.
My brother @ PERSON1 was patient once. Patience is understanding and understanding difficulties without complaining. Our family lived at @ LOCATION1 and went to Cedar Point on vacation. We had fun all day at @ NUM1 we went to @ ORGANIZATION1. @ PERSON1 turned blue @ ORGANIZATION1 while the rest of the family turned red. Blue keeps you on top for @ NUM2 and lets you down while red pulls you up to @ NUM3 feet. The line for red @ ORGANIZATION1 was shorter than the blue, so we started first. When the ride was over, @ PERSON1 was already at the top of the blue @ ORGANIZATION1. We heard a loud sound indicating that the blue cast of @ ORGANIZATION1 was going down. But the blue cast was not going down. @ PERSON1 was stuck at the top, @ NUM4 feet in the air. @ PERSON1 had a bird's eye view of the park. I would have been scared if I was @ PERSON1. At @ NUM5, the lights on the merry-go-round came on and the cast fell apart. Finally, he got a ride. Each ride has earned free season passes at Cedar Point. This is a time when @ PERSON1 had to be patient.
On @ DATE1 we went to the doll tree I want to go to the game stop. But I was patient then we went to the game stop.
At first I woke up from my sleep and felt really sick, @ CAPS1 took a shower and put on my clothes. I said to my dad " can I go to the doctor because I feel sick ?" "??? @ CAPS1 he said "we'll be leaving @ NUM1 am" and it was @ NUM2 am. Then I had to wait on the couch while my brothers, dad and mom talked about showers. After that I wanted to scream and complain because they were going too slow and tried to play @ CAPS1 gorgeous. @ CAPS1 I haven't. When they finished they had to search for the keys until they found them. It was @ NUM3 am and my dad's favorite music was on @ CAPS1 we stayed and watched the whole movie. In the middle it was @ NUM4 am, then we went to the doctor and had to wait for everyone to take turns until it was @ NUM5 which is our turn. We did make an appointment. They checked out what was bothering me and it was nothing. @ CAPS1 I left and I always waited for my brothers to finish. In the end, I was @ CAPS1 pissed off because I had to wait for them to get in the car. My dad said "are you happy? You said you felt sick and that there was nothing wrong with you. @ CAPS1 we came home thinking I had been patient all day. I said to myself "I learned my lesson and if you are patient the day can go by quickly.
During @ DATE1 I went to @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION2 to visit my aunt @ CAPS1. @ CAPS2 got up early and drove to @ LOCATION4 I was the first time I was going to fly. My dad said i better have patients or else the ride was going to bother me and my sister got on the plane and flew to @ LOCATION3 and it took @ NUM1 minutes and it was easy but then @ CAPS2 got on another plane and went straight to @ PERSON1 and it took @ NUM2 hours. I did a really long ride but I had some patient but my sister didn't have any patient the whole trip she was asking which @ CAPS2 was going to get there. And that was at the time, I had patients.
For a while, I was patient. @ CAPS7 was going camping so @ CAPS7 got carried away and found out the car lasted @ NUM1 hours so I had to be patient. I played @ CAPS4 ps @ NUM2 for a few minutes, it was @ ORGANIZATION2 @ CAPS7 that left early so @ CAPS7 could do something when @ CAPS7 arrived. Then I tried @ CAPS1, I was so excited. But I could with the @ CAPS4 @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 casins shouting and shouting, I finally fell asleep. then @ CAPS7 hit a @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 was out of gas lukuly @ CAPS7 wace in full ??? of a gas extension it took @ CAPS7 an hour to fix it, so @ CAPS7 meandered over a @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ CAPS7 lefe thing. Then @ CAPS4 cusims got all excited @ CAPS5 The @ CAPS6 " @ CAPS7 are all the finest " I was happy to be able to pitch the tent @ CAPS4 and go to @ CAPS13. I saw the campground and when @ CAPS7 came up @ CAPS7 had to put everything in place I had to be patient to go to @ CAPS13 then the kids found a pack and cores. @ CAPS9 wanted to go @ CAPS4 mom, wanted me to take them I was so aware @ CAPS8 doesn't want @ CAPS9 ??? ??? ??? So @ CAPS7 stayed @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11 shouted that the park was close enough to the campsite. Can I eat @ CAPS10 as quickly on q yes if as ul pose and fank is @ CAPS4 so @ CAPS3 and went to @ CAPS13.
I was patient when I went to Cedar Point. We took a base, it took seven @ CAPS1. So my friend @ PERSON1 decided to watch movies on @ CAPS2. We watched the street dreams and the unbelievable. We were still a long way from Cedar Point. We decided to call my mom for a joke. It was hilarious so we did it again. Then we took turns to take a nap and watch the wide open road. Finally, we both fell asleep. When we woke up, we were there. This is the moment when I waited patiently. Because I waited patiently, I don't mind waiting now. I learned to do something else while waiting. Now I can wait longer. It helped me in my future.
I was patient during the meap. I was patient because I was done early and a lot of people hadn't finished yet. When i finished early i like to draw or do some of my work but i had no job so i am new then when everyone finished we waited @ NUM1 min then we let's start the meap again when I'm done with no one else was done so i waited @ NUM2 or @ NUM3 min then everyone was done then we stretched for @ NUM4 min then we sit down and start the @ NUM5 part when we're done we can work I'm usually the first done. Then when I finished the test I get up and walk around so that I can get @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 on my tests like the meap test because getting good grades is so important and when you are patient, you will find grades like @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 to become good.
On my last trip to point @ CAPS1 I made a horrible mistake. I stood in line for @ NUM1 hours on the mantis. I had to be patient, but it was difficult because… the fans of the gentlemen were having technical difficulties. And how can I be patient when it's @ NUM2 degrees outside ?! The only good part of the line was the shade. This was @ NUM3 the way I kept my patience. "I thought to myself," and in no time you will be there. "@ CAPS2 I spoke too early. Half an hour seemed like @ NUM4 hours, but I think the heat was just getting to me. Finally after @ NUM5 hours online, fans of haze @ DATE1 to get up. Patience can bring good luck. I wait for what seems like only ten minutes but it was actually an hour After I got off the ride I was released I guess patience in some ways is the key to success.
One day a man named @ PERSON1 had a doctor's appointment and slept too much ; when @ PERSON1 got out of bed he saw he was late for his doctor's appointment. As @ PERSON1 got out of bed, he rushed into the bathroom for a quick shower, like he had time. @ PERSON1 noticed he was grilling later so he couldn't wash or brush his teeth so he grabbed some gum as he walked out the door. @ PERSON1 finally arrived the doctors came in and saw that there were millions of people in the room to wait , he went to check his name and sat down. He started to get frustrated and tired of waiting, so he calmed down and realized patience. @ PERSON1 spent two full hours playing with his phone and the many apps he downloaded. @ PERSON1 was so busy he didn't realize he was the last person to wait yet. Other people had their exams and left and others left without theirs. Finally, they called @ LOCATION1 for their meeting. As @ PERSON1 walked in he put @ NUM1, maybe @ NUM2 pieces of gum in his mouth and started talking. @ PERSON1 finished, came home, flew in his shower and brushed his teeth, got back in bed and fell asleep.
Patience is very difficult for me. Having patience is very difficult for me, because I am not patient at all: I cannot wait for things. At school, I always check the time. I just can't wait for class to end most of the time. Sometimes I think I rush things a bit too much. I would like to be patient, but I am not. I am not patient because I think about what comes after waiting, I get too curious. For example: in class, I am excited about the end of the day. Someday I want to improve my waiting style. I don't think this will happen anytime soon.
Patience is very important to me. My mom always says you have to be patient to be successful at anything. Once I was at home on the computer. I was surfing the web and enjoying it. My mom shouted across the house for me to come see her. I got up from my chair. Walked through the kitchen, down the hall and into her bedroom. She said she had to go to @ CAPS1 to do the grocery shopping. She wondered if I wanted to go with her. I said no and asked her if she would give me a sanawich. She said yes and left. While she was gone, I emptied my room. Laundry file and watched television. It was around @ DATE1 and she still wasn't home. I was very hungry and started to worry about her. I was tempted to call her but remembered what she always said, be patient for success. About half an hour @ DATE1 she came home. She bought me some meat for lunch so I could make a sandwich. While I was eating, she told me that she was proud of me for my patience while she was away. I think patience is very important. I also think everyone could use a little more.
Patients, in my way of saying it, are a person who waits if they need to. The only reason I put it my way is because I know that my family is patient. Pations is the person where if they get stuck in traffic they will be able to sit and wait or there will be a very long wait or a long queue. Or they can wait for something they need. Patients are just waiting for my turn, I should say. It's about waiting if I have to do it or if something is missing and they have to wait for him to come and get it. This is what patients mean to me in my own way.
I'll tell you about one time I was impatient. I had worked every day at @ DATE1. I was trying to do my best to make money. I was saving up to three hundred dollars in bow, a fifty dollar target, forty dollar broadband and other hunting accessories. I found myself more and more impatient every day. Slowly I was starting to get tired of working, tired of saving money and tempted to spend it. Finally, I saved enough money. I bought my things. I practiced all day. Soon I became more specific. I was ready to go hunting. The first night I went out, I passed a doe eight meters away. I haven't had anything close enough to shoot since then.
Once I was patient was when the gunshot was going around. I had to go to this place to take the in-flight photos. When we got there we stood in line, I had to be patient because the line was really long, is it ??? the line to be crossed. We brought chairs, hot food, and staff to keep our feet up. I had to be patient to say I was on the front line. The worst part was that most of the tide was outside and it was the day before @ CAPS1 so I had to be patient in the cold, when we finally entered the building I was so happy. Then, towards @ DATE1, we came to the first row. Glad I didn't have to stand in line for three hours to get a flight photo again.
I was patient while my game was taking too long, so I had my puch my big tr so much because. It drove me crazy, then my mom suggested she hinted that I was going down the stilts, she got money for mum, she bought me in my house, she took the path that I now wait until the end. I am patient to go to lunch. he @ NUM4 until lunch now when done the test so i forgot to ask the gam above it's @ NUM5 we are going to lunch he @ NUM6 we had lunch now heard the line i got the patient for ??? She me we she made my sleb eaten so well I'm going to drink it then drink my milk and then we tried to be patient for ??? my takes of my greetings I was happier than ever.
I was patient once, that was when I was in basketball practice. It only happened at the end. no one knew this was going to happen. It just happened out of nowhere. I hit the wall. I had an accident. We were doing suicides. I was running too fast and couldn't stop. I entered the wall head first . It was also a brick wall. I didn't panic because I knew I had to be patient. I had to wait for a lot of things. I had to wait in an ambulance, which took a long time. I had to wait for a doctor to stitch me up, which didn't take long. Finally, I had to wait for the doctor to give me the discharge papers. It happened here at @ ORGANIZATION1. We were in the gym for basketball practice. It was in @ DATE1 but I can't remember the exact date. I was also in sixth grade. It happened because I couldn't stop in time. When I hit my head, it didn't hurt. When I had my stitches, some parts hurt. When they took them out, it didn't hurt. But I had a huge headache. I was happy when it was all over.
I am a very patient person. An example are the games. For some games you have to wait weeks or even months. For others, you may have to wait years. I have done this before.
I have had to be patient many times in my life. The one I remember was waiting in a long queue to open @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS6 for this @ DATE1. The line must have at least @ NUM1 people. It is one of the largest apple orchards in the area where I lived. It was my first time there, but my sister had been there, countless times. She said it was one of the scariest things she had ever been to. She also brought a friend with her. His name is @ PERSON1. The opening was going to take place at @ TIME1, and it was only @ NUM2, with the line still growing behind us. My heart was beating faster and faster. I glanced at my watch almost every @ NUM3 seconds. Time seemed to forget to keep turning. Finally, it was @ NUM4. It was then that we heard an announcement. Beep! "@ CAPS4 ladies and gentlemen! Sad to announce that we will be opening @ CAPS3 @ CAPS6 in @ NUM3 more minutes. I am sorry. Thank you for your cooperation ”click. I heard everyone in the line moaning. Lots of people have left to come back tomorrow. Andrew, @ PERSON1 and I just sat down to wait. Then finally, we heard one last announcement. Beep! “@ CAPS4 again ! Are you ready for @ CAPS3 ? So come on in! It's @ CAPS3 @ CAPS9 ! ” It was my story of patience.
It has been the longest @ NUM1 hour of my life to wait for my child. I was in the waiting room most of the time. The nurses kept giving me news, to calm me down, to no avail. So I @ CAPS1 have a cigarette to ease my nerves. I didn't know if my wife or our baby would live. Would he live happily? I just got @ CAPS1 a puff of smoke and waited for hours as I sat down, excluding the rest of the world to protect my own thoughts. Would he be chosen? I sat down, ignoring the nurses' pleas, trying to reassure myself. Would it block life? I sat down, waiting for my newborn baby. My silence was broken, by a crying baby. I rushed into my wife's room, to find her holding a beautiful little girl. "@ CAPS1 you long enough"
The one time I had patience was when my family switched to @ CAPS1 Avencher and @ CAPS2 are online to keep thrilling me from the biggest coster in the park. “@ CAPS2 are online,” I said to a kid who had cut in front of my friend @ PERSON1 and I as @ CAPS2 walk up the ramp to get on the ride. The kid went to the back of the line, the gust got longer, @ CAPS3 and the kids stood up. As @ CAPS2 climbed to the top of the ramp, the merry-go-round harp massaged for @ CAPS2 to sit there for about a while, then they fix it @ CAPS2 comes in and I take my glasses off. The merry-go-round looked. They @ CAPS2 go up the digestion hill, then smaller than smaller ! Then a tren then, the last hill. Exsied like a NUM1mph diver the ride was over it was a time I had patience
We were driving at @ LOCATION1. My uncle therefore lived there as he always came to our house, we went to his new house. I was excited to go, but there was one problem, it was over ten hours away. My parents woke me up the morning we left and I felt so tired. I looked at the clock and it said six thirty. I knew we hadn't brought a lot of food and stuff so we went to pack our bags and into the van, but it took longer than it seemed to take. My dad said we would be leaving around seven-thirty but it was an hour longer than we expected. We packed everything and we were on the road. I had fallen asleep in the back seat for about an hour. We stopped for an hour and @ DATE1 and I woke up. After we got back, my brother and I watched a movie on our portable DVD player. We kept driving there and I knew it would take a while, but I kept my patience and fell asleep most of the time. When we arrived @ DATE1 it was great. Their house was on top of a mountain, I had a fan visiting them and we were walking around town to enter the shops. I had fun seeing my uncle and aunt. It was the moment when I was patient.
One time I was patient was when my family went to @ CAPS1.I. adventures and we all wanted to go on the waterslide. The biggest waterslide there. It had the longest line, it was spinning and my family was at their wit's end. I was early in the morning when we finally got in and went to the starting waterslide. It was pretty much @ NUM1 foot huge. And we stood in line and only half an hour had passed when my mom let him do it. Then another half hour had passed when my older brother left. Now it was just my other brother, my sister, and my dad stood in line. When someone got injured during the trip and stopped him for two hours. Eventually they reopened the merry-go-round, so now my other brother and sister didn't come with us. So now it's just my dad and I left in the queue. So it was our turn to do the next round when my dad found himself on the left so it was me and an old man went on the same little fletch. The old man met his pance and I was so happy to finally continue.
Patience is very important, it can help you be successful in many things. In school, patience is very important because some things just have to wait. It is important to be patient at the game of chess or checkers, because while other people are making their move, you can think about the move you will make to counterattack them. Patience is very important when playing games or doing homework. Patience is also waiting. For example, everyone is excited the night before @ CAPS1 and can't wait until morning, but they have to be patient and wait until morning. Also, on your birthday, you don't know what you will get, but instead of taking a look, you have to be patient, you can open the presents. Patience is a very useful skill to have
“@ CAPS1 ! Today is the day we go to point @ CAPS2,” @ CAPS3 exclaimed @ PERSON1. “@ CAPS4 on @ PERSON1, lets get this show on the road.” @ CAPS5 announced. The @ CAPS6 were planning a vacation to go to point @ CAPS7 @ CAPS22 @ DATE1 and today is the day they have to leave. The family retrieved @ CAPS22 from their suitcases and crammed them into the car. When everything went been located, they took off. "@ CAPS8 @ CAPS11, how long is this reader going to take ?" @ CAPS9, @ PERSON1's older sister, asked. "@ CAPS10, about six hours honey." @ CAPS11 replied. The @ CAPS6 lived at @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS21, they had to drive to get to @ LOCATION2. “@ CAPS13 @ CAPS11 !!! I can't survive six hours in a car !!!. " @ CAPS14 @ CAPS9, you wanted @ CAPS4 here, you just need to have patience like @ CAPS3 @ PERSON1 here. " " Guess I won't wait. " @ CAPS15 about three hours in the car @ CAPS9 n did not stop posing at several times the question " Are we still there ?" " @ CAPS16 Although the answer was always" @ CAPS17 ", she asked for it anyway. @ CAPS3 @ PERSON1 finally got bored of it and shouted " stop it !" Just have a little patience! ”,“ @ CAPS18, @ CAPS18 ”, @ CAPS9 replied,“ I'll stop. ”@ CAPS15 about two more hours, they finally arrived. Parents bought the tickets and asked to their kids what route they wanted to take. They both smiled and said "The @ CAPS20." @ CAPS21, they walked to the line and waited. They just waited, and waited. A little more. @ CAPS15 what seemed like a four hour wait, @ CAPS9 gave up and shouted "I don't wanna stand in line anymore ! I'm leaving!" @ CAPS21, the family got back in the car and left. When they settled in, @ PERSON1 told @ CAPS9, "@ CAPS22, it takes patience and you can have fun." @ CAPS9 did not respond.
One day @ PERSON1's mother, "@ CAPS1" decided to go shopping and @ PERSON1 desperately wanted to go. But her mom kept saying @ CAPS2. So @ PERSON1 begged and begged her mom finally said, "@ CAPS3 but you can't complain" so @ PERSON1 went shopping with her mom. Then @ PERSON1 and his mom arrived at the store. Pretty much @ DATE1 @ PERSON1 said. “I'm on board, can we go now,” her mom @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 just be patient. @ PERSON1 then said "patient, you want me to be patient , we've been here about @ DATE1 hours", we've only been here ten @ DATE1. I have @ CAPS2 more patients have said @ PERSON1. So her mom made a deal with @ PERSON1 it was, if you're good at @ NUM1 more @ DATE1 we'll go to the ice cream parlor. The next @ NUM1 @ DATE1 has been driving his mom crazy every second @ PERSON1 saying I'm on board can we go now and hurry up. Finally @ PERSON1 and his mother are gone. They got in the car and drove right past the ice cream parlor, @ PERSON1 said, "wait", we passed him, his mother said I know. @ PERSON1 said "we made a deal remember. It was mom who said yes but you broke the deal so what did you learn. @ PERSON1 said when you make a deal sign one contract, his mother said that "@ CAPS2" patients is a virtue that you have to learn, so this is my story about patients in my own way.
One time I was patient was when I took the @ CAPS1 test in grade @ NUM1. In my class there were only @ NUM2 @ NUM1 correctors while the others were @ NUM4. so we tested in the director's office. It was the day we had to do some writing. They are tough and take time. When we started, some people rushed as fast as they could to finish. I took my time to plan what I was going to write. We've had a lot of time, so you should make the most of it to make sure everything runs smoothly. To do this, you have to be patient with yourself. This means that you need to review your answers and make sure they are correct. When I finished with the writing section, I reviewed it to make sure everything was correct. I had a lot of time. When I had finished correcting my work, I waited for everyone to do it as well while reading. It was the time when I was patient.
Patients are everything, always hear those words ! When you are in line for a test restaurant or when you are stuck in a traffic jam. You are bored and angry, but then these words come to mind. “ The patient is everything ”, once I was waiting in the longest queue to see the order counter ! I was in a hurry, I had a class that I had to get to in five minutes. When I was able to get to the counter, I saw the employees rushing to try and collect all the orders. Then I saw the reason for the holdap. There was an old man in the front row who was desperately trying to command. I didn't blame him, with all these choices he didn't know what to choose, losing the line wasn't so patient, "hurry up". One of them said “ Go ”. @ CAPS1 another I just waited patiently thinking, the line just wasn't really right. I offered him a choice and he ordered. Of course I'm @ NUM1 minutes late for my class, but I was patient and understanding of the old man, what they say happens the rest of the day I felt good about my good deed
Are you always or even sometimes patient? If this is not your normal. @ CAPS1- @ CAPS1. But everyone on @ LOCATION1 should be patient. It will help you in the long run. If you and I were patient it would be a little faster. As if your brother was in your bathroom for a moment and you had to use him. you can wait for it to finish. It is to avoid arguing and it is to be patient. I say these things like, “ I am patient ! » But that would be a lie, because I am far from it! I'm not saying it's easy, but we all try.
@ PERSON1 was a hamster. One day @ PERSON1 was out of his cage playing with his owners' sister hamster @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 had just received a brand new hamster toy. @ CAPS5 had a bunch of tubes to climb into and a slide and a rolling wheel. @ PERSON1 would have liked to have one, @ CAPS1 its owner did not have enough money yet. Even when @ PERSON1 was playing his, he still wanted one. @ CAPS5 was very difficult for @ PERSON1 to wait, especially when @ PERSON1 saw @ PERSON1 playing in hers. This is the story of when @ PERSON1 was talking to @ PERSON1, I really wish I had one of those hamster toys, ”@ PERSON1 said. @ CAPS1 my owner does not have enough money ! " " @ CAPS2 do not worry, "said @ PERSON1." You can play in mine until it does. I heard that he had nearly enough. "@ CAPS3 I guess it's pretty close. “A few days later @ PERSON1 received the brand new toy, never did @ CAPS4,“ Guess @ CAPS5 was worth the wait! ” @ CAPS5 was twice as big as @ PERSON1, so they could aground. And they both lived happily ever after.
I'm not a very patient person so I'm going to wonder what patience @ CAPS6. Patience @ CAPS6 when not complaining when planning or expecting something. For example (for your convenience I @ CAPS1 is writing a story about patience, please note this story @ CAPS6 is completely wrong) @ CAPS1 was walking home and saw an elderly woman she was having problems with his shopping. @ CAPS1 wanted to help him but all he could think of was his cousin @ CAPS2 that @ CAPS4 would be coming to his house anytime now. @ CAPS1 approached the woman and asked her if she needed any help and she replied " if you could live with @ CAPS3 ", she pointed to a large, tanned house. @ CAPS1 carried his things to the door. “@ CAPS3 go ahead,” he said. "@ CAPS4, do you mind helping me put them away," the woman asked. @ CAPS1 thought about how his mother never wanted him to go to a strangers house, but @ CAPS1 somehow knew her so he said he @ CAPS4 was helping the woman smile. @ CAPS1 then picked up the bags and said: "@ CAPS6 your house is unlocked" "@ CAPS7 it's not," she replied, where are your keys "@ CAPS1 asked:" I believe you are 'there are people lost in the lawn. @ CAPS1 searched for about half an hour, then found them under a bush. He brought her the keys and said "@ CAPS3 are you going", she opened the door and he helped her with her groceries. When they were all put away, @ CAPS1 said "@ CAPS11 I should go." "@ CAPS11 not without my being able to reimburse you," said the woman. "@ CAPS13 will get my purse." @ CAPS1 waited and waited, it must have been an hour. The woman came out of the kitchen with some change. “@ CAPS15 his only change, I couldn't find my wallet,” she said and gave him the change. @ CAPS1 left feeling like a good person because he was patient with the woman. @ CAPS1 told her mom about her good deed and cousin @ CAPS2 was able to stay longer. This was my example of patience, if this ever happens to you, make sure your patient and know the person.
One day come home ??? film we were arrested @ CAPS1 I train a train. Only the??? was??? or so we thought I have after the very big I ??? came @ CAPS1, in the car was he and my old one ??? were sitting in the car for at least @ NUM1 mints but the train was showing signs of ending. But suddenly he stopped, the train collapsed on its tracks. We the one to turn around. But @ ORGANIZATION1 cars were blades of about @ NUM2 mints ??? slowly started to start soon after @ NUM3 mints were the end of the train. After the @ CAPS2 climbed we started driving but another train was coming. So my father put the ??? to ??? and ??? it started from there, we were so patient. I go??? we spent @ NUM4 mints almost within the hour of ??? But we were patient and she dreamed of having a date at the end.
When we drive to @ CAPS1 I have to be patient. When we are in the car I have to be really patient as it takes @ NUM1 hours plus the extra time we spend going to the bathroom, having lunch and staying overnight. But when you're on the road it's so @ CAPS2, that's how I have to be patient. I have to bring a car bag for entertainment. I contain a book, ped of paper. My father's laptop too. A big factor is my iPod. Exposure, I don't like my legs to have everything ??? and the??? ???. ??? ??? hate this fall. But in the end I love it ??? you just need to be patient enough to make it happen and the end factor is the best.
One day at my school. It was lunch and I was very hungry. Lunch was packed with children. I could hear my stomach growling, I was so addicted. I stood for ten minutes and then started to think maybe I could cut. But no, I didn't. I felt like an hour had passed. I was still waiting, trying to be as patient as possible. Then I realized that the line was moving faster and faster. Until I finally had my food and ate. I only had five minutes of recess but I was just happy to eat. The patient is by
I know someone who has been patient. The person was at the doctors, she was six years old and she was still waiting. They can solve this problem by asking nicely can I get ahead of you plezz. It will solve everything in a kind and respectful way. That's what I think respectfully.
I remember a time when I was six, I was waiting in the mobile clinic @ CAPS1 almost @ NUM1 hours, so I asked them if they could change the channel @ LOCATION1 to @ ORGANIZATION1, after that @ CAPS2 got over I @ CAPS3 asleep @ CAPS2 @ CAPS5 like forever @ CAPS1 for them to say '' @ CAPS6 salslory 'my mom tried to wake me up she couldn't until I @ CAPS7 du cache seat they had in kids. I was there at outpatient clinic @ CAPS1 one reason my athsmua @ CAPS2 bad @ CAPS1 for a while because I was sick. When they called me dawm , my mom said i was really patient and nurse evan said i was actually patient to be patient for that long so she gave me a pop lollipop, (little one) after all that i am went home and I went to my bed. This is the time where I was @ Patient CAPS1 two hours.
Someone I know who is patient is my mom. My mom is one of the most patient people I know. Especially on this specific day. Every now and then my brothers, sister and I get a little hard to deal with. We were on the way to church when my brother and I started arguing and fighting, for no particular reason we are still bickering and bothering each other. My younger brother and sister would often scream and yell at each other for stupid reasons like he's sticking his tongue out at me… she pinched me. Then we finally got to the church. Guess my mom thinks it would end once there but no my three year old brother @ PERSON1 repeatedly ran and threw the church. My older brother kept insulting my sister and I kept talking with my friends. I know I wouldn't be so patient with anyone. This is why I think my mother is so patient. After church that afternoon all she told us to do was behave, and after realizing how patient she was, we just thought to ourselves that we had to. listen and behave.
One day at the fair, I was patient. I wanted to drive the bumper cars. So I stood in line. There were about @ NUM1 people in front of me so I knew I had to be patient. So I stood in line until it was my turn. They let @ NUM2 people in at a time so it took a while for me to get my turn. Then it was my turn. I wanted to go with my friends so we let some people walk past us. Then after @ NUM3 minutes it was our turn to choose our car and have fun. It was a time when I was patient.
During @ DATE1 my mom broke her wrist while we were biking on a trail. At the end of the trail, mom turned a corner too fast and knocked over her handlebars. I didn't know she had broken her wrist until she got up and told me. When she told me I had frozen, no one had ever had a broken bone in my family before, so I didn't know what to do. Mom calmly told me that we had to walk our bikes to the car, since we drove to the trailhead. As we walked our bikes to the car, Mom didn't say anything about the pain she was feeling or anything. When we got to the car, I had to put the bikes in the backseat. Now, for those who don't know, bikes are a bit heavy and putting them in the backseat of a car is a bit tricky. Also, when your mom has a broken bone and is in a lot of pain, and the bikes don't go in the backseat, it can get quite stressful. My mom saw that I was getting angry and told me to calm down and explained how to put the bikes on. After that mom told me to take her glasses which we accidentally left on the trail. I ran as fast as I could to retrieve his glasses, but they were broken by the fall. So I ran to the car and since we had the same view, I gave him my glasses. My mom needed glasses because since I don't yet, she had to drive to the emergency room, and she did so without complaint. When we got to the ER, we had to wait a bit before someone saw us. I was panicking, but mom was actually telling jokes about how she hurt herself while doing something healthy like exercise. I admire my mother for her patience and calm in a situation like this. She never once complained about the pain she was in. She didn't yell at me while I took a while to get the bikes into the car. So I was pretty much on the verge of hyper venting here and there. She calmly told me that everything was fine and helped me move forward. It was like I was the one injured and she was the mother as always and taking me to the ER. I know for a fact that I wouldn't have handled the situation so well if I had broken my wrist. I know I would have cried and wanted someone to hurry to help me. I am amazed at my mother's understanding and tolerance. I hope I can achieve this too.
One day when I went to the doctor to get the vaccine, my mother said I was very patient. My mom took me to the doctor so I could get the flu shot like every two years when we got in the car to leave, I kept saying ' do we really have to go ? " Of course, my mother said yes. Once we got there we had to wait a bit. My mom must have got the papers, so I just stood there and watched the fish swim around, then my mom said, "Let's go to the waiting room." After that, she said that I had been very patient in waiting, except in the car when I was moaning. So I said thank you and when are we going to get in there. Then when we finally got in there I had to be weighed and asked all these questions. The nurse came in and gave me these injections in my left arm. She said that you were almost the only patient child who was patient. . And that's the story of when I was patient.
Some people are patient. Others are not. Some have a short attention span. Patience is an understanding and tolerant person. They experience difficulties without complaining. Some people find it difficult to stand still or wait for something. They are not patient. There is a saying that patience is a virtue. Many have heard of it. Patience waits @ NUM1 hours online to see a movie and not have to travel. Patience does not pace. Being patient with problems is good.
I @ DATE1, my family took a trip to @ ORGANIZATION1. After @ CAPS3 arrived at the airport, @ CAPS3 had to wait a long time. So @ CAPS3 are at the airport, about to leave for @ LOCATION1 when the flight is delayed due to an early morning thunderstorm. @ CAPS6 took forever, every minute seemed like an hour, @ CAPS1 after half an hour I asked for some money to have breakfast, but of course my mom said: "@ CAPS2 ". I was about to lose @ CAPS6 when this guy came over the speaker, "@ CAPS3 will have to delay the flight to @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION3 a little longer." @ CAPS4 when I remember I have a @ CAPS5 in my bag and I'm going to turn on @ CAPS6 and @ CAPS6 is dead. Then after an hour the storm stopped and @ CAPS3 was able to board the plane. Since that day, I have discovered that I am not a patient person.
It's a matter of patience, one day my friend said to me hey have you ever been patient. I told him no, I've never been patient in my life, well you should tell me. One day my friend told me my new game was going to be released and I'm just saying why he was talking. I can say he didn't like it at all, so in class I tell everyone that I won it in the race. But I didn't have any patients on me so I complained to him, I said I won and he said you didn't have patience and it just went on and on. Then my other friend said to stop right now ! I'm sick of this you have no patients and you lost the game @ NUM1 ! Okay, we've all complained in life ! Please stop fighting. So the next day, I said: do you have something to tell me, I will listen better now. I learnd I had to listen to what people have to say while speaking which will be FRIENDSHIP to another leveal.
Some say patience is the key to life. I don't really know if this is the case or not. Patience is when you are calm, you can wait for things. It's when you can do difficult things without feeling frustration, anger, or sadness. When you have patience is when you can do things with ease, you can do it without difficulty. Patience is a self-respecting person who is kind, fair and not selfish. Patience is not disrespect, patience is okay, patience does not boast. Patience doesn't lie, it makes things better when they are difficult. This makes it easier to focus and do things better. It helps to wait for things.
When I think of being patient I think of the time I went to Southrend @ LOCATION1 for hockey we were on the road for @ NUM1 ½ hours! While we were on the way, I didn't say anything about the weather or anything, although I was on a claster bus with all of my hockey friends watching a hockey movie. When I think of patients, I think of waiting without asking " @ CAPS1 is it done yet ?" "Or" Are we still there ? " Myself, I do not have the best patients. when I want the computer or play the role of the guard or the frarwheeler and someone was on these things, I tend to ask "when will he be Danish !" many. Patients grow with you as you grow, as you get older you will be able to wait longer without stressing that everything takes so long, even this test takes patients !
It all started with a cold and snowy @ DATE1, there were only two days left before @ CAPS1 ! @ CAPS1 is my favorite time of year because you see all the lights that are the colors of rainbows. People are also very happy this time of year. I always get impatient to wait @ CAPS1 to @ CAPS6. This year, I was going to be patient. @ CAPS4 I started to be patient as I went with my mother to buy a new light tree @ CAPS1 and to buy gifts for my family. While we were shopping there were all kinds of people in the store. @ CAPS4 when I got to the checkout there were a lot of people online. My mom also told me to be patient, @ CAPS4 I did. When we finally got out of the store, we rushed home to start decorating. I blew up @ LOCATION1 which was taking a long time, but had to be patient. Finally, it's @ CAPS6 to make the cookies, which was the best part. We cut the dough and put them in the oven. It took them a long time to cook. My mom said the patient can. '' @ CAPS4 I was patient and the cookies ended up all fasting with sprinkles on them. With everything done and set up, we were ready for @ CAPS1. '' @ CAPS6 on @ CAPS1, '' I thought to myself. I have to be patient or @ CAPS1 will never be @ CAPS6. @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS10 everyone came to have dinner with us and received their gifts as I bought them. As everyone was leaving I went to my room without remembering that it was @ CAPS1 @ CAPS10. Then when I woke up late and everyone was waiting for me I got excited: @ CAPS13 I was patient and it paid off.
Being patient means being understanding and tolerant. I was patient when I went to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1. When I walked to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1, I had to queue. I didn't have to wait that long but had to wait, I didn't like it, but I was patein. It was worth the wait. Had to queue for food as it was very crowded there. It was worth the wait too. There the food was good. This is how I use my art of living, patience. Patience is a good life skill to practice.
Once. My cousin as a patient because she was going to the mouie @ CAPS1 one evening. @ CAPS1 there were a lot of children in her house @ CAPS1 she had to clean the house before her mother came home. Also @ CAPS2 that day she called all of our mom but they didn't pick up @ CAPS2 she rushed @ CAPS1 tried to clean up before her boyfriend came. Then she rushed @ CAPS1 to get into the tub and then went out to put the kids @ CAPS1 in the tub. She still had to clean and then she gave us what to clean. @ CAPS2 she rushed over to @ CAPS1 who left us there while she fetch us something to eat @ CAPS2 we clean up while. She left. Then she called me and told me. I'm on my way with some food, I said oh. Then her boyfriend came over @ CAPS1 he was good to go. She came back the house was clean. Then his mother came home @ CAPS2 went to the changing room, he was getting dressed, his mother told him where to go. She said to the slut and at a party her mum said no you are not going to clean the bathroom first she got mad and said mum i have been on patien all day i am ready to go . @ CAPS2 she washes it goes @ CAPS1 then they left.
Patience is when someone is understanding and tolerant. Well, I'm going to tell you about someone who is patient. My friend @ PERSON1 is a very patient person. @ PERSON1 is understanding because when someone asks her to wait, she listens and waits. When her parents were talking, and when she was trying to tell them something, they told her to wait because it is rude to interrupt adults when they are talking. @ PERSON1 is a very patient person.
One time I was patient was when my birthday was coming. I wanted my birthday to come sooner. But my parents kept saying no. @ CAPS1 the party has arrived, I got all my gifts except those from my parents. They told @ CAPS1 everyone was leaving they would give them to me. But no one left before ten o'clock. So I fell asleep. When I woke up, no one was standing. So I still had to wait. (I hate to wait.) @ CAPS1 my mom stood up I asked if I could open my presents she said wait for your dad to get up. @ CAPS1 my father finally got up (@ NUM1) I was finally able to open my presents. It was worth the wait.
I woke up to the sound of the alarm clock on some sort @ PERSON1. It was @ NUM1 my mom was on time to get ready ???. I was in a hurry to go. Today was the day the x-box @ NUM2 came out and I wanted it. My mother had made a deal with me. If I was patient the whole time we were running the bow, I might get it. Like an hour later we arrived at the grocery store. I rushed inside and grabbed a cart. My mother repeated that I had to be patient. So the rest of the time, I just followed my mom and never showed the slightest sign of impatience. After what seeing done like hours, we were done and the next stop was the library. I couldn't do anything there without getting in trouble, I hated it. But I just sat there on a bench quickly. It was already dark when we finally went to the best buy to buy the x-box @ NUM2. We went to get it and I was so excited! My mom said I deserve it after being so patient all day.
This @ DATE1, I went to @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS1 the part we forget is the @ NUM1 hour plane ride. We were in a group of @ NUM2 families all my friends. When we got the plane we were out, @ CAPS1 on the door were scattered all over the place. So I sat down with my favorite friends from @ NUM3 on this trip. We were all loaded with the enemies as electicails. As we walked I thought @ CAPS3 was going to be a snap, @ CAPS1 got it wrong. At first @ CAPS3 was fine, we were chatting and playing games in our I pods and sorting, @ CAPS1 after about @ NUM2 hours we started itchy and our I pods died. So we decided to watch a movie as our mind dvd player. @ CAPS3 ran out of battery and the plan was broken. The thing died and we still had about @ NUM2 hours and we only got to watch one movie. On the back of each seat there was a TV so we forced @ CAPS3, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS3 was one of @ NUM6 of ??? does not have ???. We started to really see ??? and @ CAPS3 was getting late. We didn't know what to do @ CAPS3 was hopeless. We had to sit and wait so sitting down was a real discussion about patience. We??? @ NUM3 at home ??? @ CAPS3 was the longest @ NUM3 horrs ever. We did nothing. @ CAPS1 as we wanted, we rushed out of our seats and into the air, we read that @ CAPS3 was finished. We no longer needed to be patient.
Patient for me it's hard but it's a time when I was patient. It was the first day of school, and it was the end of the day. At the end of the day there were volleyball trials. I wanted to try but I didn't have my physique. So while everyone was playing volleyball me and @ NUM1 other people were sitting and watching @ NUM2 @ DATE1 !!!. I was not patient at the time, but @ DATE1 at the end of testing my mom picked me up and we went straight from there to the sports center doctor's office so I could do my checkup. So my mom and I walked in and she had to sign and fill out some paperwork because she didn't make all the appointments for me. So it took about @ NUM3 min. then we waited, waited and waited until @ NUM4 and @ DATE1 if you add that @ NUM2 @ DATE1 waiting there doing nothing. I was patient, but my mom certainly wasn't. So eventually they called me and took my mom to a room to wait while they took my height and weight. Then they took me to the room where my mom was and we waited @ NUM3 min. then finally they gave us the paper / physical, then we left. Practice ended at @ NUM7 and we didn't get home until @ NUM8 !!!. It was a time when I was patient.
Once I was patient, I want to go soccer with my dad, but I didn't want to. So when he put on his shoe when I asked him to come and play football, he took off his shine. Then I had to wait two and a half hours just for him to get one. When he put on the second shon, I didn't say anything. We are doing when and playing football. This is how I learn if you use your patience on the willpower so that you can do it a bit safely.
One time someone was patient was my mom when I wrote on the wall she was very angry with me so my sister said she did so my mom had her patients and listen to what we had to say then she said you are all in a lot of trouble because we didn't say better but we still had to clean everything up for a week because she was very patient with us and c is how someone I know shows patients.
Patience @ CAPS3 a sense of tolerance. Having 'patience' means you can wait, it will come to you if you just wait. like when you swallow your food thinking it is going to be stolen when in reality you could have left it there and yet it would still be there. Patience @ CAPS3 knowing that everything @ CAPS3 will be fine and that you have the time. Have patience to do something, @ CAPS3 to take your time, or go at your own pace believing you will finish. Patience @ CAPS3 usually how long you can wait to do something, or even put up with something. Patience can also mean that now you can endure something, like a tyrant for example. He or she laughs at you over and over again. But how long, how much patience do you have before you push the edge and you can't take it any more ! IT'S @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 PATIENCE @ CAPS3.
"@ CAPS1 @ PERSON1, it's @ PERSON3 how are you" ? " I'm @ CAPS5, the upp of @ CAPS24 ?" @ CAPS27 I'm calling to ask if you want to go to @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 with men? "@ CAPS4 yeah" !

" @ CAPS43 one second (@ CAPS44! ) (phone!) "@ CAPS40"?
The moment I showed patience was when I had to go down a toboggan. It all started when I was at @ LOCATION1. I want to go swimming in a place called @ ORGANIZATION1. The place was so big you could fit @ NUM1 people there. The time I was patient was when I was walking up the stairs to the slide when everyone is rushing past me just to go down @ NUM2 slide. So I waited about @ NUM3 minutes just to switch to the fun slide. The coat of arms that took me so long is because you have to climb the flight @ NUM2 or the stairs with ??? So the second time I went up I went up the stairs so I could be the first so I did and had to wait again because there were still people there since the last one time. So I waited my turn. It was then that I was patient.
When I was patient I was in line at the gender point for the @ CAPS1 we got there late at Cedar Point so we went to the end of the line there was a sign saying "your wait will be of @ NUM1 hour so we stayed in line for an hour we finally got to the front. I was so excited as I walked up the stairs I realized I was just waiting an hour and @ NUM2 minutes for that and then I mounted it ??? was ???
One hour I was patient was @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and I was arriving at @ CAPS3 @ NUM1 hours earlier. @ CAPS7 we are heading towards the reception panting because we thought we were late and @ ORGANIZATION2 said "It's okay !" I said "@ CAPS4 am I late for the appointment for Foyce" ! Wo your @ NUM1 hours early "she said" @ CAPS2 you fired me. Go out @ CAPS1 two hours preferred to school to be @ NUM1 hours early " ! I said" sorry, would you like me to take you back to school "" @ CAPS6 I'm fine. "I said @ CAPS7 we waited in the lobby and I was ok with that because I had the ??? west as a game @ ORGANIZATION1 ball @ CAPS8 that chichi @ NUM4 for @ CAPS9.S ! Easy I was that @ NUM5 when this happened and now I'm almost @ NUM6. Then the @ CAPS3 came out and I got @ CAPS1.
@ DATE1 one day I was at the store with my sister and my mother, people were hanging out and jostling each other and shouting " get out of my way ". It drove me and everyone crazy, but like everyone else, I didn't yell at overworked people. It was almost Christmas, I saw why everyone was going so crazy. We were all trying to think of our own bussnie. But for some people, the dust drove everyone crazy, so that's when patience entered. After all, we went out and came home. That is why you must have patience.
One day my brother and I went hunting in the oaks of @ CAPS1. It was about a mile and a half walk. When we settled in, the hunt began. We waited but saw nothing but we weren't going to give up. So, after an hour, we saw a flock of turkeys roaming around like penguins. Their feathers started to lose their color. And as they got closer, the beards of the males went side by side like a tree on a windy day. After watching them for about @ NUM1 minutes, they probably grabbed our envoy and ran away. After that we knew the deer wouldn't come out but we were wrong, about @ NUM2 minutes later we saw a deer. And we watched him until he got to the shooting range. I was looking for other places and told my brother that there were deer around us. So he looked and he saw it and only one of them was a deer. So we watched them as they got closer like a storm getting closer and closer. So my brother withdrew his bow. He held his bow for over @ NUM3 minutes, it almost looked like a statue. And my brother waited for him to turn around because his head was turned the other way and just when he was perfectly visible he fired. The arrow shot like a bullet from a gun. The arrow did not hit it, it moved about @ NUM4 feet from the deer. The deer heard the launch of the arrow and ran. We waited to hope that there were more deer to come but we didn't see any so my brother and I cleaned our blind. And we got it all back to the car. When we got home, everyone was waiting at the door. But we told them we didn't have any. So me and my brother had dinner and then my whole family sat down to watch a movie.
Patience can really help you in life sometimes, it's the only thing that can keep us sane. Patience is important. Just like the way my dog ran away and I'm waiting for her to come back. Sometimes you will get a bad mood if you waited for someone, but there is always only one choice, wait or be patient.
I like to create a house or a puzzle. Because it takes time to do puzzles, it takes hard work and patients to complete a house. If you don't have patients, it's harder to finish it when you just get a board from it.
My father is a very patient person. He is known to be patient. Here is an example, his camera. He waited @ NUM1 whole years just to get a goal. Because he was patient. My mother is very patient. My mother is patient too. She waited a whole month just for a pair of slippers, because she was patient. I am proud to have such a patient parent. Which means I know they are very responsible and that's what I think the patient is.
When my brother, my father and my two cousins got out of the car @ NUM1 hour drive from @ LOCATION1, we knew we would have fun. I looked up and saw a spectacular sight, the @ CAPS1 roll galore. I saw Cedar Point, the amusement park. In the car, we talked about @ CAPS1. The Maverick, the Millennial Force, @ NUM2, @ CAPS2 and the Mentis. When I walked in I knew this way was going to be fun. Just as we walked in we saw the @ CAPS2, but the queue was huge and we decided to come back later. As the day progresses we almost go from @ CAPS1. As we get closer to @ CAPS4, we see at least @ NUM3 people online, so we have the chance to participate in the highest race. When we got to @ CAPS2 the queue was longer than at the start of the day. We discussed and decided it wasn't shrinking and we set off. About a little while later, a @ NUM4 year old guy is with his mom. On the back of his shirt is a cool fish, so my cousin asked him what it was. He said it was a tropical fish from @ LOCATION3. We ended up talking to them for half an hour until we got on board. The ride was amazing and well worth the wait. This is how I was patient and learned that waiting leads to good things.
I was patient once was when I went to @ LOCATION1 with my @ CAPS1 + cousin. Had to babysit my cousin @ CAPS2 while his room was packing as they were heading back to @ LOCATION2. My cousin can be a handful sometimes and always gets what he wants. But I was patient and I expected that the trip left. I didn't complain until I got home to my mom. My cousin and I had a fight while on vacation. But I still love him. I had to be very patient with my cousin and maybe even do whatever he wanted but I knew his mother was very proud of me. I remember when we went for a walk in a pond to find alligators. But then @ CAPS2 wanted to go into the peloton. I knew I had to give in (considering he was @ NUM1 and immature). But I just went with the flow and we went to the peloton. It was a time when I had to be patient.
Patients are something not everyone has. In order for someone to be patient, you need to understand and tolerate things that can be very difficult. I am one of those people. Patients are kind of a gift. It takes time to get patients and you can't always be in a rush. For example, I once heard someone talking in my basement. So I went there to see who was in my house, @ CAPS1 I was walking I heard some laughs and excitement I kept walking until I heard voices coming from behind a door. I went to open it and saw all kinds of presents and saw two people, my mom and my dad. They rushed over and closed the door and told me to go up the stairs. So I ran up the stairs to tell my brothers what I had seen. They were all excited and everything. The next day passed and I couldn't wait until @ CAPS2 the next day. So i waited
@ PERSON1 wanted a dog. She really did. She had been asking him @ CAPS1 for a while now. Whenever she asked her @ CAPS1, she would reply " You can't have a dog until you earn it." " @ PERSON1 did not know how @ CAPS7 the won, she thought for a moment she did not really know what his @ CAPS1 meant, she said her @ CAPS1 meant she needed @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 its share of responsibility. She looked at the clock that said @ NUM1, almost dinner time, she thought her @ CAPS1 was probably working on it, so she got @ CAPS7 out of the kitchen and there was her @ CAPS1 doing to prepare dinner. @ PERSON1 asked a little more than loudly "what's for dinner ?" steak and mashed potatoes. It was @ PERSON1's favorite. She nodded and said “ I can't help ! " " Why not? " his @ CAPS1 queried. @ PERSON1 asked her what she could do and her @ CAPS1 said that @ CAPS7 put salt and pepper @ CAPS7 on the cooking steak. His @ CAPS1 felt quite happy that @ PERSON1 was willing to help @ CAPS7. @ PERSON1 did what she could then went upstairs @ CAPS7 to her room, she was hoping @ CAPS1 would get the message. She had dinner with her @ CAPS1 then went to bed @ CAPS7. The next day, she ran down the stairs @ CAPS7 and found her @ CAPS1 sitting in the bus. She quickly says "what are we doing today?" son @ CAPS1 replied "I thought we could just hang around the house." @ PERSON1 was starting to get impatient, she wanted a dog and she was trying @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 to be good, then finally she held on and yelled "are we ever going to have a dog ???" his @ CAPS1 surprised by @ PERSON1 said “ good …… ” @ PERSON1 interrupted “ @ CAPS1 I @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 ONE AND I @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 YOU ! "her @ CAPS1 answered well if you were more patient, I was going to say maybe we could go see anne" @ PERSON1 felt bad for veiling and realized that things would be better if she was moaning later that day she and her @ CAPS1 stepped out one day.
The time I was patient was when my sister dropped my phone in kool-aid. I was going to buy a new one, but it depended on my behavior. It meant that I had to be very good and patient. Every day for the rest of this week I was fine. I still haven't had a new phone so I asked my sister when she was going to buy it. Well since it was her fight, she offered to buy me a new one. She told me it was going to happen and that I had to be patient. Another week went by and I was starting to get impatient, but I didn't. The next day my sister took me to the metro computer store to pick out a new phone. You see, by being patient, I finally got a new phone, and that's when I was patient.
One time I had to be patient was when I went to an @ ORGANIZATION1. You have to be very patient, especially when everything is complete. For example, when I was in line for a shirt, the queue was very long, so I had to be patient. It took a lot of patience as the @ ORGANIZATION1 was full and there were only three booths with @ CAPS1- shirts so I had to wait. At @ ORGANIZATION1, we had to be patient in several ways, like parking to get to our seats. When @ ORGANIZATION1 took a @ NUM1 min break, I went for a pop and all the lines were long. I stood in line for about @ NUM2 min while waiting to have my soft drink and cousin fries and a soft drink for my sister. I finally got it all and forgot my pop but luckily she gave me a new one just in case it's mine @ CAPS1. I went back, drank my soft drink and watched the show. Everything takes patients and when you wait you get everything you need. It was a time when I had to be patient.
Being patient is like a jungle cat hunting its prey. It must remain perfectly still to make it a prey. You also have to be patient. Then, once he's in the right position, he taps. The cat achieves its goal by being patient.
One time I had to be patient was during my dance audition. Every year at @ ORGANIZATION1 grove college, I audition to help pay for my classes. I was ready and motivated to go dancing, there were about @ NUM1 people in the dance hall. I worked really hard when I left the audition. My teachers told me that we would receive a letter in the mail indicating the amount of the scholarship I had received. Every day I waited at the mailbox hoping my letter would arrive. A month has passed and I still haven't received anything. I started to worry and thought I wouldn't get anything. One day when I gave up hope, a letter reached me in the mail telling me that I only had @ MONEY3. I was very upset because my classes cost @ MONEY1 and @ MONEY3 was not a big help. I wanted to stop dancing but it was a talent that I had and that I wanted to continue to exercise. So I waited for the dancing to start and my teacher told me there was a mistake, I actually got a scholarship for @ MONEY2. My mother was very happy and so am I. My teacher apologized for the confusion and for the time it took for this to happen. I learned a skill that year, patience can bring you rewards, but don't give up because you will be fine in the end. I have also learned that it is good to learn patience from an early age, because as I get older a lot of things will get in my way and I have to be patient to be able to overcome them all.
I once went to the doctors. The doctor said to wait in this room with my brother, sister and mother. She said another doctor would come. We waited three hours in this room. My mother was crazy, they forgot about us. The doctor who was to enter has the wrong room. The worst part is that I had to take three shots and I hate the shots. In conclusion. I learned that my mom is not that patient and I got ice cream after the doctors, so patience always has a reward.
That's still @ NUM1 lost minutes ! I knew I should have arrived earlier! Ulg ! So many people and so little time! Have you ever had to wait @ CAPS1 for food ? Three days ago I thought I should stop by my locker before going to lunch - @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 ! I slammed my gray coated locker and ran to the cafeteria. I rushed past a sea of seventh-graders urging me to go to lunch. I grabbed a tan plate and waited for my pancake @ CAPS8, "what's holding up?" I thought. I @ CAPS7 reached my destination, @ CAPS6 the food was at ! I reached out and - wait @ CAPS6 is the food? The food platters were @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 ! The aroma of the pizza caught my senses and made my poor little stomach growl in anger! I paced angrily, "@ CAPS6 is the food?" @ CAPS7, a lunch lady announced that she should do @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 in an under bun. I jumped over to the other line. I grabbed the tongs with disappointment and put some fries and cheese on my plate. At least I ate! I slumped down at my table and another lunch lady walked up to me and gave me a soft, spongy, warm @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11 for @ CAPS12 ! She thanked me for my patience. “I had a cookie! A hot, delicious, @ CAPS11” I thought. Sometimes the wait can get annoying, but sometimes @ MONTH1 is rewarded !
One time I was patient was when I had to wait in the waiting room before I had my foot broken. I waited about an hour and a half. It was really annoying that everyone walked past us. Sometimes it is difficult to be patient, my mom and I sat in the chairs for an hour and a half. Finally the nurse said "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2" so I walked in and we had to wait for the doctor to come in and it took a good twenty minutes or so. And all the doctor wanted to know was how I broke my foot. So we had to wait for the nurse to come back and put on a cast. And it also took a long time, because they had to put five layers of fabric on it first, then they put like two layers of plaster, and then I had to wait for it to dry. So having patients can sometimes be difficult, but anyone can have patients.
One day not too long ago @ CAPS1 my brother @ PERSON1 had some homework problem. And yes @ CAPS2 is a matter of patience. My brother comes home with homework every night. Mostly math. One day he needed help. I said "on what". @ CAPS1 he said "@ CAPS2 math homework it's just too long and I can't do it." @ CAPS3, my brother is in fifth grade and the homework only lasted fifteen problems ! I said just do the homework. About two minutes later comes another moan I need help. @ CAPS1 I helped him. It took a lot of patience, and I was very patient, for him it took an hour. I check his work while he and my mom argued. Oh, and @ PERSON1 took a shower too. It turned out he got: one, two, three, not two correct answers. While I wait patiently for him to get out of the shower, I receive a separate piece of paper that has copied the issues, answered them, and understood them correctly. When @ PERSON1 comes out of the shower, I hide the answer sheet. He got angry when I told him he only had two. Although with my patient skills, I helped him. At student-led lectures I saw he got an A. What a happy ending to a paper full of patients.
Patience is a lot. Patience is used every day. You can wait for a check, you can wait for a letter. Sometimes patients can be fast or slow. @ CAPS2 can be used at school or even at work. If you wait patiently, things could happen to you. For a test, you can be patient while waiting for a question to be answered by waiting a little longer for the answer instead of going fast and not getting @ CAPS2 correctly. Patience can be used in @ CAPS1 in experiments @ CAPS2 could also be used in math to find an answer. When you build a model you must use patients, so @ CAPS2 being correct in not having @ CAPS2 patients will be wrong. This is what patients mean to me and everyone should use @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS2 in your daily life.
Patience is a very important value. To sacced, you need patience. I was patient in my life when I got my first horse. I needed patience with her because she was stubborn, self-centered, and poorly trained. I had to teach her the movements at a slow pace so that she could remember how she was supposed to do it. I also needed patience for her as she had just moved into the current house and did not recognize the surroundings. These are just a few of the ways patience has appeared in my life though.
69 days ago @ CAPS1-three miners in Chile got stuck underground. They were stuck 800 meters from the surface. Now they are safe and sound at home. However, the question is how are they still alive today? The answer is patience. What is your question? Patience is an understanding and tolerant person or persons. When the miners got stuck they didn't panic or blame each other, they waited for someone to help them. Then @ DATE2, after they were found, the miners told them they would come out of the hole to @ DATE3. Even though @ DATE3 was four months away, none of the miners complained or shouted. They all understood the difficulty of getting out. Fortunately, on @ DATE1, all the minors come out unharmed. It all took patience to practice. It took @ NUM1 and a half hours to restart all @ CAPS1-three minors.
On the way to point @ CAPS1! I scream in my head. It's so crazy! were just derost from lake erie. I see him ! It was right there within walking distance. Oh my God, the parking lot where we pull up to the stamp station and pick up our stamps and walk to the medal bars, we pull up and security says 'no'. We found it only opens at ten so we waited and waited and waited and more and more people came, and soon it was very crowded and more people came and me and my cousins @ @ CAPS2 PERSON1 and all went to play under the stage and we had to queue for it. Finally @ NUM1 times to enter the park, we all piled up to fince & ram out chokes there, we went to queue to retrieve it for @ NUM2 min. hey it was totally worth it. And yes patience helps "a lot"
It was @ DATE1, @ NUM1 my brother's birthday. He became @ NUM2 and he made me angry because he kept asking my mom for stuff and he kept saying no she didn't have it. Then he would ask my brother to be like you know I have this money for my baby. So he kept asking people and it pissed me off because when someone says they don't have it, they don't. I didn't say anything, I was silent because it was her birthday but I know how to be patient when it's something important or special. So I was looking at it and looking at it and then I said here you can have my money, it's your birthday so go ahead. So I gave him what he was angry and asked for and he got it. I had patience because I didn't leave him because it was his birthday and it gave him what he wanted.
A time when I was patient. The day I was patient, I had an asma attack. I was very scared. And even worse, my inhayler was broken. It's not good. So my mom sent @ CAPS2 to the doctors. The doctor gave @ CAPS2 a respirator and then I was fine : @ CAPS1 gave @ CAPS2 a perscripsnion and said "I repeat them whenever you feel like you can't breathe anymore." I said "ok" @ CAPS2 and my mom went to @ ORGANIZATION1 and dropped it off, we said we'll be back in an hour. I went home and fell asleep then my mom woke up @ CAPS2 and said use had to go get it. So we went to @ ORGANIZATION1 and they said "wait a minute please" "ok" my mom said. We sat in the car for an hour of waiting and waiting and waiting. I was very peasant my two little sisters were crying because they wanted to come home. My mom was unpaid that day (which is not good) so she was angry. The worker ended up saying "@ CAPS3 you're gonna sorry about the merchandise" my mom paid the police and we left. That day I was very pagan.
One time I was patient was when my family and I went to West Viragna. And we had to get up early to take part in the road show, we wouldn't have to go in traffic. The shows are on tour and when we get there they had a nice house. But we had to want to queue just to get into a restaurant. and it took them @ NUM1 just to get us in. And we had a nice dinner. than at a time when I was patient.
What is patience? Patience is the act of understanding, tolerating, and experiencing difficulties without complaint. I'm going to tell you a little story of what every parent has to go through that takes a lot of patience. My little brother, @ PERSON1 was born @ DATE1. Since birth, my mom dreaded potty training day, which she knew would come soon. As you know @ DATE1 the price of diapers and pull-ups got quite expensive so when @ PERSON1 turned @ NUM1 he started potty training. Potty training requires a lot of patience because sometimes the child @ DATE1 does not go to the potty and @ DATE1 continues. My mom knows this, but she gets annoyed anyway when @ PERSON1 decides to use the toilet for himself. At other times, Mom becomes very patient because she knows all of this is known to her and that he is still a little child. My mom is still working on being patient but she knows that soon @ PERSON1 will be older to use the bathroom or toilet on her own without wearing a pull-up. A lot of good things can come out of just being patient.
Two years ago my father had surgery on his because he broke it at work. I had to sit in a room to wait for almost ten hours in a very uncomfortable wooden chair doing nothing. I walked to the car to stretch. After about four hours, I was really tired, but I didn't fall asleep. and a half hours, that only seemed like two to me.
I am patient in a lot of things, when I play I am patient. When I take a test, I am patient. I am almost patient in everything. A lot of people are patient too. Some people are not patient at all. Just like some of my friends when we play soccer there is no patience. They just want to take the ball and score. Once I was playing in the park with my friends, I was playing soccer, my friend told me to pass the ball. He was not patient at all that day.
Patience is the key to tolerating troubles, problems and helps you avoid making tragic mistakes. You have to be patient anyway ??? a challenge in your life. Without patience, nothing would stop you from rushing into a situation with a hazy mindset. If you try to manage something without the necessary patience, you could be making a critical mistake and / or reducing your chances of being successful and achieving your goals. In situations such as sports games disputes, disasters and many other occurrences, patience will indeed come in handy. When playing sports, being patient will come in handy when you are waiting for playtime, when your team is running late, and when your teammates are not doing their jobs and responsibilities within the team. Having patience, on the whole, will most likely help your team perform well, and also respect sharing your opinion. Ultimately, this will help you deal with the situation a little easier. During a disaster such as a house fire or dealing with tornado damage, being patient allows you to sort through all the things you've lost, and you've made it possible to clearly think of a bait of what just happened. go through that i experienced a house fire so I know being patient is a great way to deal with and deal with such a situation. Overall, I guess what I'm trying to say is that when you are patient you run into trouble without complaining. Right now you @ MONTH1 don't think this applies to you, but honestly I can guarantee that life isn't a 'bunch of roses' all the time, so sooner or later you will have to do proof of patience. It is not usually human nature to wait carefully for things to happen, but it is indeed a necessity in everyday life. So we all have to recognize the quick importance of patience, so that we can all live a better life, I certainly don't mean we have to hurry and learn this trait, no, we just have to learn it patiently.
We were in a line at Cedar Point one day for the sprinter. We had to wait for what seemed like an eternity. I was losing my patients so my dad told me to go get something to drink and come back to the same place. I was up and someone said it and security got us back to the end of the line. We were crazy and my father was also losing his patients. We wait for hours for it to finally be our turn. We waited that long and the ride took a few minutes. We said we will never go back on this ride. It was a time when I lost my patients.
The time when I was patient with my little brothers! I was babysitting and they didn't want to listen to me or my other sister and I just relaxed and got down on the floor and played with them after everything went well pass.
Have you ever felt like your @ CAPS1 was going to explode ? Have you ever wanted to say something but didn't because what you said would make it worse? This is what I felt in this story! Little siblings drive me so crazy that I want to exploit. The story starts at @ TIME1pm my brother @ LOCATION2 just left work and is complaining that he is fed up with going home on his own so I was going to surprise him by going home with him. I just graduated from high school and heard my name called so I looked around and heard my name being called again the voice kept being called so I stopped and my sister @ PERSON2, and my friend @ LOCATION1 came behind me and stopped @ PERSON2 said "I didn't want you to walk to get @ LOCATION2 by urself" so we keep walking and savanah and I keep changing and the scooter got slower and slower, and slower and slower because two people were driving, we stopped and hit the power reset button and started again, then we called @ LOCATION2 and went said we hadn't seen him and it was already @ NUM1 he said he was at his friend's house and my mom was coming to pick him up. We turned around and two minutes later the scooter died, we keep pressing the rest button nothing happened so I ran home to retrieve the bike. no stopping my legs were numb as soon as i got home my legs collapsed i got up and put on shorts, grabbed the bike and ran to the door @ PERSON2, and savanah was already at the party store @ LOCATION1 asked me and asked "@ CAPS2 did it take you that long" I told him what happened as @ PERSON2 pushed the @ PERSON1 and that savanah got on the handlebars. In my @ CAPS1 I was thinking about how long it took me to get there and now I have gone mad. I had come and how I thought I was going to charge because the scooter died, we put the bike and the scooter away and walked through the door and fell. The lesson learned is not to do something unless your certainty happens. I learned this the hard way and I never will.
When my family went to Makiew we had to wait to get on the boat. We were patient as we had to wait to get on the boat. We had to wait at least @ NUM1 minutes for the boat. He didn't start standing in line with @ NUM1 years old @ CAPS1, he just stood in line . Once we got there we went around the island by bike. We did what he wanted to do. While we were doing this, I was patient. @ CAPS1 I think the trip is going pretty well, because everyone was patient.
I have to be very patient for a while because my sister is going to have her sweet @ NUM1 at @ DATE1. So it's a little hard for me to be patient about it because my mom and sister are planning so many things at the same time. It's hard for me to relax while they go out to pick up some party stuff and on top of that we take a trip to @ LOCATION1 before his birthday. So we have a lot of projects to do in a month and a half. It's very hard, she has to be patient. Look at my mother ?? ?? plan a party and still be able to ?? on the trip to @ LOCATION1 with my family. All my life I have lived ?? be patient but it is ?? ?? ?? ?? try to be patient ?? ?? ? / ?? ?? ?? ?????????
My story about patience is when my sister was at the doctor. It was a long day. At first we walked in and it took her an hour to get in. and she finally came in and I was just sitting in the waiting room. I saw people come in and then leave. I see about @ NUM1 people doing this. I sat down and read magazines about why I was waiting for her to finally come out. When she was, the day was pretty much over. And it was a very patient day.
One day when @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS1 came out I wanted it so badly so I asked my mom and she said maby for @ CAPS2 and guess what @ CAPS2 was going to happen. It was @ DATE1 and I couldn't wait so I went to school and finished it everyday and kept coming over there and saying "I'm sure I'll have a @ ORGANIZATION1 like mom "and that's about the time I told her that and she said" you have to be patient or I'll never even get it for you because you have a little brother in around and if he hears you say I want this and he's going to think @ LOCATION1 isn't real then be patient. Well, the last few days I've started to be patient and had to be patient for awhile because it was only @ DATE2 and I went to school and sure enough it was stupid and a waste of time but I didn't care because I was about to to get a @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS3 then I just had to take care of it and be patient at the same time. well I know one thing, I'm lucky I haven't asked for @ CAPS3 in the last few days. am patient. I really can not yc laugh. So now I only have @ NUM1 more days against @ CAPS5 so I'm really out. So I was on hiatus @ CAPS5 the last @ NUM1 days and @ CAPS5, so I played video games to save time, then the last @ NUM3 days I played outside, it didn't So was not a waste of time. Then there was only @ NUM3 more days against @ CAPS5 and I had just played outside of the news, the day was over for the last couple of days, I even played outside with my friends the day before @ CAPS5. Then the day came @ CAPS5 finally i saw my gifts and my mom said you open them somehow looked at them and once i opened all my gifts i didn't see the @ CAPS3 , and my mom gave me a present she was holding and it was the @ CAPS3 and finally I got it so now I don't need to be patient anymore, the end
@ NUM1 @ CAPS1 there is a child named @ CAPS2 had a problem. This problem is something he would like to keep to himself. He felt like this problem was going to end him. His problem was that he had to go to the dentist !!! @ CAPS2 hated that they drill into your teeth. He also hates the smell of the dentist's office. @ CAPS2 had to leave in three days and he was even more scared because he is going alone this time. He then realized that he couldn't be such a baby so he wanted to be patient. He easily waited for the two days and then the day came. He woke up and rode his bike to the dentist, then waited a little while before he had to go back to the room for the dentist to give you your exam. He decided to close his eyes and be patient. After it was over, he returned home and was relieved that the patients were there.
Do you know someone who has been and still is patient? Everyone was and most likely is patient. Some people learn to have good patience by learning from an elder or a role model. Being patient can sometimes be a big pain! You have to know how to have a good attitude even when you are in a very bad mood. Having patience is a good thing to have because you are definitely good with children of all ages. Works great with people in a bad mood. Patience must also work with listening or respect. You might have a child who doesn't listen very well, so you have to be patient with this for them to listen. If someone doesn't have great respect for people, it takes patience to work with them so that they can have good respect! In summary, patience is a one-way street in life.
I remember when I got lucky if steak house and the lady said we had to wait half an hour before we were seated. I thought I was going to die but my mom told me to be patient. So there were about twenty mituens left, I was about to scream but I sat in my chair waiting without saying a word. But I waited for excienley and lost my mind. There are ten minuets left and I'm about to explode I want to eat but I can't but I still haven't done anything I haven't spoken ??? got the bathroom. @ NUM1 left I calm down and about to be ready to eat I still haven't said or done anything. The ??? can eat and enjoy so happy we order later the food comes out and this was the most patient i have ever had in my life.
Patience is difficult, for example when you walk into the office of an @ CAPS1, you must patiently wait your turn to see @ CAPS1. Patience is just another word for "wait", you have to wait to see the @ CAPS1. But instead, most people say you can't patiently wait to see @ CAPS1. But instead, most people say you can't " @ CAPS2 wait to see @ CAPS1." Patience is difficult for some people. Lots of people can't wait to see a @ CAPS1. another example is "@ CAPS3" when families go on a road trip, you here @ CAPS3 tell mom when are we going to get there, and that's my weakness us, well that's a sign of no patience . What would I say if someone walked up to me and told me what is patience ” ? I would say "wait" wait your turn, ??? for the back, wait for @ CAPS1, and wait until we get there.
One time when I was sick was when I went to the doctors. When I went to the doctor for an examination, my appointment - you had to @ TIME1 and we have not been called before @ NUM1. I had to wait a long time! Finally when we entered the doctors room the nurse took my blood pressure and I had to wait another @ NUM2 minutes for the doctor actuall . By the time the doctor came in he was about @ NUM3. I am my lead shot and the pig smoke shooting. When I was all done it was @ NUM4 I was ready to go home. It is a time when I am patient.
Some people are completely patient. Some people are not patient at all. But I; I'm kind of stuck somewhere in the middle. When I hear the word patient, I think of several things. I think of my cousin @ CAPS1 because she is not that patient. I think of my mom because she tries to be really patient. But mostly I think about myself. You see, I may be the most patient person in the world, but other times I have no patience at all. I do my best to be patient. If it's @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 or @ CAPS2, I'm trying to be patient. When it's my birthday, I try to be patient. When we go somewhere special, or try to do my homework, I also try to be patient! It's like @ PERCENT1 lucky I'm patient. I think the main reason I can't always be patient is that it's something that can irritate me very quickly. I guess I'm kind of losing my temper. Even though I can lose my temper very easily, I can still be patient sometimes, when I cook dinner I can be patient even though I am very hungry and the food takes too long to cook. I think for some people patience comes naturally. Like singing or dancing. But for others, it doesn't come at all. All in all, I think patience is something that everyone should have a bit of. If you don't have any patience at all, it means you don't have patience in school. You won't be patient with your boss when you get a job. Don't get me wrong, I know that sometimes it can be difficult to be patient. Adults and children / adolescents are not always patient either. I think we should just try to be patient as much as possible, all the time!
Patience is no fun, but it is sometimes necessary. I'll tell you that patience is no fun. It was a calm day at school. I waited for the well to ring. My friend @ CAPS1 was finally going to give me an answer to my question. The question was do you love me? I couldn't help but think about it. Ring! Ring ! Ring ! Finally, I could see @ CAPS1 as excited as I was, I rushed out of the dorm. I went to his locker and he gave me a note so I read it. He said, maybe, that I like you. I was so happy. Patience is no fun, but my question was answered. The next time you need to be patient, a good thing comes to those who wait.
At some point, you have to be patient. If you are in a queue, be patient. you have to be patient to wait for a part to separate. You have to be patient if something happens in the middle and you can also wait for what is or not what it is and you just can't run to get it. When you go to the store and see something you want and mom or dad tells you that they will give you your brithbay, you can't wait for Bathbay, then you can't wait for your birthday. Well, I went there. I like crismasis because you have pretty much everything you want; When you want to do something you've always wanted to do, this is the first time you go. All of these things, you have to be patient.
It is the story of a boy who became a prince and a girl who needed it. It's a love story, of course. Usually these types are. My name is @ ORGANIZATION1. Everyone calls me @ CAPS1, although I'm empty inside I'm leaving. There has been gore for a while. Mom died when I was only six years old. And over the next ten years, my @ CAPS2 deteriorated. He's still there, in his old chair. Sometimes I hear her cry at night @ CAPS7. He is useless now, but I am patient with him. I spend most of my time away from home reading @ CAPS7 in the park, doing odd jobs for a little extra money, running along the endless sidewalks of our city. I know it's not just @ CAPS2 that I'm waiting for, love me too. I need somebody. I keep pushing that thought away but the truth is, I spend all of my time waiting. The wait pays off, however, the view. One day, in the park, a boy approached me. He was tall and slender, with short brown hair and shining blue eyes. His name was @ CAPS3. He told me that he had seen me here before and asked me why I was reading here rather than at home. And that day was the first day with @ CAPS3, my prince. I was no longer just @ CAPS1, I was @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS3. @ CAPS3, who saved me from myself. @ CAPS3, my other half. @ CAPS3, who disappeared three weeks after I met him. He left hasn't shown up since @ CAPS7 the night I was crying, right there with my @ CAPS2. Every day, I wait for him in this same park. I am patient with him now too. It is the story of a boy who is a prince and a girl who waits for him. I didn't know there were so many ways to say goodbye. Holding hands, like when mom passed away. Hear @ CAPS2 cry. A little kiss with @ CAPS3. But I know how to be patient. I'm still waiting for a hello.
Being patient means your understanding and tolerance, I have been patient too. When I went fishing, I never caught a fish before. I would just sit there and do nothing. Don't complain, don't say anything because the others around me have caught a lot of fish. I felt like a stupid person, but I would just sit there and just see other people catching more fish than me. As I got older, it was always the same. I wanted to shoot myself every time someone caught another fish. I hated every time someone caught a fish but I was patient. My dad always said I was going to catch a fish and I believed him when I was nine I went to a friend's house for a party. He lived by a lake. Everyone except my family brought stems and feelings. I had nothing to do, so I asked a boy if I could borrow his rod and fish while he ate. He said yes so I walked to the lake and threw the rope. I saw something big come out of the water. All of a sudden, a huge tag on the line almost threw me into the water. Winding the line little by little so that it does not break. Finally, I held the fish high above my head in a triumphant manner and beamed like the sun. I finally got a reward for being patient all these years.
The four sisters lined up for the second most exciting ride of their day at Cedar Point. Just behind @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. The roar of the roller coaster and the screams of its riders zoomed in by @ CAPS14 started to stop again. " I'm soon super, super excited !" » @ CAPS4 the youngest sister ???. " I know it. " The rest said almost simultaneously. Eight hard eyes were moving at the same time looking at the same thing. The @ CAPS5! There were twists and turns, torirs, diues and hills involved in this serious package deal. "@ CAPS6". @ CAPS10 it's been a long time ?! " ??? @ PERSON3. " @ CAPS7 hour. " @ CAPS8 oldest, ???, putting her curious long dark hair in a ponytail. " @ CAPS9 young grasshopper "a said @ PERSON4 has the side of ??? face, "@ CAPS10 this son really got me" @ CAPS11! " @ PERSON1 agreed with a look of annoyance on his face. "@ CAPS12 my ??? guys look! Were almost in the front! Exclaimed the second oldest @ PERSON2. " @ CAPS13 me ! " Said a voice coming from ??? abusing. " @ CAPS14, you be patient, but we are having difficulty with the ride and this will be fixed as soon as we run. Thanks. " " I really hope @ CAPS15 finishes it soon ! " @ PERSON3 said. '@ CAPS15 all agree. @ CAPS15 waited about half an hour @ CAPS7 @ CAPS14 another ad fell. " @ CAPS16 again thank you for being so patient but this problem will not be resolved until @ NUM1 overtime. Thank you for choosing Cedar Point. And the voice went out and @ PERSON1, @ PERSON2, @ LOCATION1, go surf the grant swings.
It was the day of the central @ LOCATION1 and it was after school that I was in the paraid with my football team and the queue was going really slow and finally we made it and it was out from home with my best friend @ PERSON1. Well he made me ready and I went to his place and I played a little bit and then we went to get some food. So when we got into @ ORGANIZATION1 there were about @ NUM1 cars and they were all in the way and we sat in the car for about half an hour. But it was lucky because the game only started at @ NUM2 and it was @ NUM3. So we sat patiently and ordered some food and left to go to the soccer game. And it was a time when I was patient.
Patience is difficult. You always @ CAPS1 now not later. You have to be calm and be patient so that they almost forget what they are for, but I still have it @ CAPS1 now too. I can't stand not having something. If there is a test on @ DATE1, I won't be happy if the test goes to @ DATE2. I just can't do this for long and it gives my tension just to know what's going to happen. If you have patience, it's almost like a gift, just like singing and dancing a gift.
"where is it?" The woman asked for the third time. “@ CAPS1 the hallway, to the left of the bathrooms,” I said for what must have been the fiftieth time. I grimaced as she walked out of the showroom, she didn't say anything. My dad worked for a small business that produced gift shop-like trinkets like snow globes etc. @ CAPS4 offered me a job @ DATE1 after my sixth year helping him at work. I had no idea what @ CAPS4 was saying meant going to @ LOCATION1, standing in the middle of the hallway in a huge building and telling people where his showroom was. When you work in manufacturing and commerce, you often don't meet the smartest and most educated people. You really need patience if you want to go anywhere. "@ CAPS2 dollars an hour, @ CAPS2 dollars an hour." I whispered to myself as a middle aged man approached me. @ CAPS4 read my badge with the Young's blue and white logo embedded on it. " @ CAPS3, are you with young people ? " @ CAPS4 asked. “ Do you know where the showroom is ? " I could tell what thought @ CAPS4. Why did a teenager work for a cooperative? "@ CAPS1 the hallway, to the left of the bathrooms." I say in a robotic voice. "@ CAPS6 aren't you a bit young to do this kind of work ?" @ CAPS4 asked. Maybe you were expecting an intern? I thought about it in a hurry, but instead responded with a complacent "@ CAPS8, sir." " @ CAPS9, are you old ? " @ CAPS4 asked interrogative way. "@ CAPS11, sir." I lied. I knew I could pass for a high school student so I knew @ CAPS4 would believe me. I really wished @ CAPS4 would go ahead as I was getting quite nervous. I was already starting to imagine what would happen if I grabbed his tie and pulled on it as hard as I could. Doing this all day was @ CAPS12 healthy. " Are you getting paid ?" " @ CAPS12 enough to support people like you. I thought. I took a deep breath and I said, " yes, sir. But that's a lot @ CAPS12. It's more like volunteer work, really. @ CAPS13 no longer asking questions, I thought. @ CAPS4 smiled and continued, "thank you son." "You're welcome." I say, partially gritting my teeth. I think we will both agree that I was patient that day. And I hope this man bought a load of stuff from my dad's store because if @ CAPS4 didn't, I'll be very upset. It was then that I was the most patient.
Patience When a person is patient, he can wait a thousand years for a response. Or he / she understands what the problem is when you get stuck. I still think they are saints when they have the patience to look after their wives, their children and their work at the same time, and to keep their cool. It's amazing. Patience is when the person is still theirs when you need help and they will give you patience right around them. I think patience is calm, doesn't lose its temper and helps you when you need a little patience boost
I always have to be patient when putting together model airplanes. Sometimes I have to ask my dad for help putting together more difficult models. Like the @ CAPS1- @ DATE1 on @ NUM1 bombers. I also have to be patient when hunting rabbits, squirrels, deer and turkeys. If I am not patient I could mist a good blow or a good animal. Sometimes I have to wait at school with @ CAPS2 and other students.
Back when I was patient when I really wanted to go to my favorite store. @ CAPS1 I woke up and told my dad I wanted to go to my favorite store. @ CAPS1 my dad said "let's go". @ CAPS1 we went to the store and he said it was closed. @ CAPS1 I am checking the hours and they were going to open in @ NUM1 minutes. @ CAPS1 my father and I are patients. Well mostly my dad because he didn't say "let's go" or anything. @ CAPS1 @ NUM2 passed and we had @ NUM3 more minutes to wait. Finally @ NUM3 minutes and it was about time, but the people working there said to wait about @ NUM3 minutes because they had to get things done. @ CAPS1 my dad always likes nice. He waited @ NUM3 more minutes, @ CAPS1 we could get in. Now finally @ NUM3 minutes later and we were able to walk in and I was @ CAPS1 happy. Being patient is the best thing. No complaint or nothing.
It was a beautiful sunny day outside, in the middle of @ DATE1. It was so hot outside, it was like the Sahara Desert. “ Honey, put on your swimsuit and shorts and get in the car, ” my mom shouted out the window. “@ CAPS1 mom,” I asked. "It's a suprice," she replied. So I did as she told me, wondering where @ CAPS9 was going. When @ CAPS9 arrived, I knew exactly where @ CAPS9 was. @ STATUS1 @ CAPS2. I got out of the car with a big smile on my face. "@ CAPS3 will continue @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5, I want to come," I asked my mother. “@ CAPS6, sounds like fun,” she replied. When @ CAPS9 got to this thrilling roller coaster, I looked and the line was all the way to the end of the sidewalk. "@ CAPS7, I don't want to wait mum, it's too long," I complained. "Patient @ CAPS8, honey @ CAPS9 is going @ CAPS8 on the roller coaster in no time," she replied. An hour later ……… “ Mom, it takes forever. " I groaned. “@ CAPS9 are the next in line,” she replied, still smiling. So when the doors opened I was so excited and nervous I couldn't believe I had waited an hour to take a walk. “You've been very patient,” my mother said with her hair standing on end. "@ CAPS6 I was, and @ CAPS3 proud of this," I thought to myself.
One of the most patient times I have ever had was downtown @ LOCATION1 in one of the best places @ CAPS1 around @ CAPS1 dolls ! While my dad and friend waited at our table, @ CAPS2 was very hungry. It had been @ NUM1 minutes since ordering @ CAPS2, but I have remained patient as much as I was angry and hungry, I have remained tireless for my food. Finally it came and I was satisfied.
Honestly, I really don't have a lot of patience. I get angry at the smallest things. I got everything from my father. Usually. I will get impatient when I wait for my mom to come to her car. Sometimes we go dancing, sometimes we go to the mall. Anyway, if we're late, I panic. Even when I go to something small like a birthday party, I hate being late because everyone is usually there by that time and I will feel left out. Sometimes I get impatient because people annoy me. For example, when someone makes random noises and I tell them to stop and they don't, it really tires my patience. I also can't stand when someone starts biting me for no reason, it really annoys me. Another thing that makes me very impatient is when my parents lecture me on something that I already know when I'm in trouble and just want them to finish already. Sometimes it will be so as not to clean my room and my mom will lecture me, say things she's said to me a million times and it bothers so much that I just want to scream "stop talking". Other times, it will be so as not to take my dishes in my room, my bathroom or plug me in the kitchen. It's just a repeating lecture and I already know everything they're saying so I don't have much patience for that. I can be very impatient at times, but I still have some in me, so if you stay on my side it won't wear them off.
I'm writing a story about a time when I was patient. One day on my birthday @ DATE1, I was above my dad's house. My dad asked me where I wanted to go for my birthday. I didn't know at first but it came to my mind. I told him I wanted to go shoot in the paint room. And he said okay. But before he left he said, can you cut the grass for me. I said okay. So I cut the grass which took me about @ NUM1 hour and @ NUM2 minutes so I told him I was done and he said ok so I took a shower because I felt there wet grass. And when I finished taking my shower, I called my friends and relatives to see if they would come and they said sure. So I asked my father when are we going to leave for point shooting. He told me it would be another day. So I called all my friends and cousins to tell them that it was not going to be today. They were okay with it. And my dad said we were going to go before the stars of @ DATE2 and we went. And now, to this day, I am still patient.
There are many times @ CAPS1 in a people's lifetime where someone was patient. Patient @ CAPS1 a very important trait that could lead to its own rewards. I'm a dancer at @ ORGANIZATION1 of dance. There is @ CAPS1 a very wide age range in every dance class. Sometimes we have a hard time learning something as difficult as a switch jump, or something as easy as a pieroette. Everyone who @ CAPS1 in class @ CAPS1 is so patient when these events occur. @ MONTH1 takes fifteen minutes for the teacher to correct one foot position, yet the other dancers remain seated, waiting so patiently. Patience also occurs when training a dog. Obviously, dogs don't speak @ CAPS2, so they'll have a hard time learning. Shouting at the dog @ CAPS1 a sign of lack of patience which will not help the dog to learn. But praising the dog or gently correcting him, @ CAPS1 a sign of being in control and patient? Eventually, by taking all that time to teach him the rules, you'll end up with a great dog, all because you've been patient! As you can see, being patient brings happiness and comfort to others. Not to mention, @ CAPS1 is what @ CAPS1 respectful. Like I said, being patient @ CAPS1 is a very important lesson to learn and it should never be forgotten.
@ PERSON1 waits for the patient while the class speaks. I go to the classroom closet to ping, she'll clap the third time until they stop talking or are silent. When they calmed down, she would continue to teach then ??? @ PERSON1 is talking, we should wait patiently and until she talks to us. This is how @ PERSON1 is patient.
PATIENT. I once had to be very patient at @ CAPS1 barrymores because we got into a queue to go on go-karts that Yexi had to be at least @ NUM1 or older to go. I also had to be patient for my birthday this year because I knew I was getting cool stuff but I never imagined it would be so cool.
I remember a time when sister @ CAPS3 would talk endlessly about ice cream sundaes @ CAPS4 and all that. @ CAPS3's mom had to drive me all day because @ CAPS3's dad was sick, which meant the "cream girl @ CAPS4" had to come too! @ CAPS3 mom knew @ CAPS6 was going to have a long day. @ CAPS5 was in the car and @ CAPS5 drove past @ ORGANIZATION1 and that's when @ CAPS3's little sister said out loud "I'm hungry, I want @ CAPS1 !!!." That's what @ CAPS6 said while shouting for five straight minutes. That's when @ CAPS3's mom shouted " you talk about @ CAPS4 cream, you get it @ CAPS2 !" " The sister @ CAPS3 then had that face which meant that @ CAPS6 was about to cry, which was even worse !!! @ CAPS3 mom gave him a cookie to keep @ CAPS6 happy for a while; @ CAPS5 started coming home when @ CAPS5 heard a song on the radio, @ CAPS3's sister loves to put the word "@ CAPS4 cream" in every song so @ CAPS6 started to squirm while holding her language. @ CAPS6 stayed like that all afternoon. @ CAPS6 hasn't said a word all day ! So @ CAPS5 walked past @ ORGANIZATION1 then @ CAPS6 started crying. @ CAPS6 has had enough. "I want @ CAPS4 cream !!" @ CAPS5 was laughing at her, so @ CAPS5 went back to @ ORGANIZATION1 and gave her what @ CAPS6 wanted most from his "@ CAPS4 cream". @ CAPS6 has been patient all day, @ CAPS6 knew it was hard work. Little sister @ CAPS3 learned an important lesson that day, which is that “Being patient means good things will come to you.
Once I was patient, it was when I was going to have my teeth cleaned that ??? that I went to the doctors. I waited three hours (@ NUM1) for my pacifier to be cleaned and it was by hand, so I pulled out a book to read only when I was reading the book on @ NUM2 ½ times i was called to have my pacifier cleaned, after that i went to the doctors to get wald, medisan filled and get shoes. I had to wait about two hours (@ NUM3) before being called into the room, but then waited @ NUM4 so they could prepare for the shots. So I waited about five hours and five minutes, after all this time I finally went to lunch at @ ORGANIZATION1. That's all I did that day.
Loyalty is when people stand up for and support something. I think everyone should be loyal to your ??? because it means that you believed and that you have a reason to be dedicated and driven to have a purpose. Loyalty to me means not backing down by showing perseverance. I know someone who is always loyal and stands up for what they believe in. This person is my brother @ PERSON1. My brother @ PERSON1 is going to argue with everyone. My brother is loyal to "aliens". I say that because he thinks aliens are ??? and don't care what anyone else has to say. I tried to contain it a million times, there are no physical aliens. But he keeps saying that "@ CAPS1 is alien proof." @ CAPS2 my brother never lies to anyone and will always support you. If someone says something is not true, they will stand up for you. He said, "It's not cool when someone else talks about another person, all it means is that that person is unaware ??? My brother never leaves anyone behind talking about me without answering. One last thing is for my brother to stay true to himself. He never tries to be someone he's not. He said, "I tried to 'being someone I'm not and it's not me. I'm a nerd with street intelligence, I mean I always sprinkle coals. In conclusion, my brother is a loyal person for the simple fact that he stands up for whatever he believes in. Even if it's alien, ??? or himself.
This is my story of being patient, I close my hope of being "write a stay on you too have been patient". My way of doing this is by going to a doctor's office and waiting @ NUM1 hours to get a corset for my friend's wrist. First the decor is in a waiting room then an office, with it was necessary to wait @ NUM1 hours. So my dad and I were in this waiting room, it was supposed to be. @ NUM3 meet up and she told us to sit down, and there are @ NUM4 other people lellge. So I said, thinking my mom was going to see him. Iany first appeared @ CAPS1 and it was a bit of a wait because I will be very patient. But my dad wants him to worry and then fall asleep. As people walked by help was calling to get lost patients, lots and lots and lots of it. Them and @ CAPS1 hour present by, @ CAPS1 I ? I said life was for me, but it should be my child my mother. Since I had "or ion" I jumped off my dad and woke him up and went to see the mom. These walked for an hour, but I was patient. So the adder came in and gave me the corset, reinstalled and left. It was a story about his patient at the doctor's office and for a @ NUM5 minute thing.
Being patient is good because then you respect that your problem will take time, but when you are impatient you want to get over the problem now or soon. I remember when my brother was @ CAPS1 impatient. My brother @ PERSON1 and I were waiting for a new video game to be released, but it's coming out in @ NUM1 days. So he waited a day, checked the date, @ NUM2. Then I waited another day @ NUM3. He wasted @ NUM4 days waiting while I focused on school. His rating fell to a @ CAPS2 + and now he's blaming @ CAPS3 ! So I told him harshly @ NUM5sucsess. He tried harder @ CAPS4 - he was using his time for notes while his playing he wants is @ NUM6, he is much happier now that he is patient using time wisely while keeping busy.
This is the story of when I was patient. It was hot and I was sitting on the grass with the radio on. As my favorite song went away, I reached out to change the program. But when I heard the man tell usher to sell tickets and I froze to listen, the tickets were selling in town. I told my mom about it and she rushed in the car and sent a dozen so fast you wouldn't even see us leaving. When I got to the line it was so long it seems like it lasts forever. I waited and waited, I felt like he was only moving an inch. I waited and always waited for me to start to get angry but I stood in line. The end of my long wait, I start jumping for joy again. As I walked towards the concert, she said to me, “ Sorry, we're all exhausted. I couldn't believe it, I started screaming my head again. I did all of this without expecting anything it was so unfair. And this is the time that I have been patient to write down.
Be patient by: @ PERSON1 A few years ago I started horseback riding. I love him so much. About @ NUM1 months ago I ordered new riding boots. It was a time when I had to be patient. My mom and I went to the tack.corn stake line and ordered my new boots. When they arrived, they were too small, so we sent them back. Days and days passed while I waited for my boots. They did not come. I had to be patient. Another day passed and my mom finally called them. They said when you reship something, I go through a fourteen day process. My mom and I had to be patient. Weeks have passed and still no boots. My mom got a new credit card that week. Another week passed and my mom and I were impatient. She called the company again and they said when we tried to change the shipping on your credit card your credit card refused. But @ CAPS1 the problem is solved and I'm glad I was patient enough to wait for the boots, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 rolling comfortably in my new riding boots.
Once I was patient, I would wait for my mom to pick me up from school at @ TIME1. The end of school is at @ NUM1 so I had to wait next door for almost an hour and a half. It was winter back then so it was around @ NUM2 degrees f. It was very windy too, so I used my instrument case to block the wind and snow from my face. But it didn't help much because I couldn't feel my face and saw a clock inside the school and found out I was only here @ NUM3 minutes ! The wind and the snow were terrible. I was counting the number of teachers and people coming out of school, I was so bored. My face was red as a cherry. So I started to read to pass the time but my fingers started to get cold and I was dreaming about all the hot things in the world. It was hot chocolate first, then @ DATE1, then it was Florida at @ DATE1 on a hot day. But I was patient as much as I could but it was very difficult. I was cold as ice and rummaged in my bag for something warm and found gloves to go with my coat and jeans. I read and read with gloves so that my fingers do not freeze. Then I see a red car looking like my mother's car and then a wave of grief washed over me and I couldn't take it anymore! But when I got up a car pulled over and it was my mom, I put my things in the car and turned on the heaters and my mom said thank you for being patient.
Have a little patience. Do you have patience or do you know someone who does ”well, that's exactly what I'm going to talk about in my own way. Once upon a time there was a very spoiled little girl who wanted what she wanted. There was something about her that no one knew. She had patience. Everyone was always hurt about her, there was something special about her. One day she and her family were going out and she couldn't wait but you know what patience she had. She also wanted to pick up something from the store, @ LOCATION1. She was not like other children, couldn't wait and always bothered her parents, she sat patiently. When they left they went to @ CAPS1 but they were rich so they also went to @ CAPS2. She couldn't wait to leave, but you know what made her be patient in the store and get that peaceful thing she wanted. When they walked into the store, she finally got what she wanted, it was just lip glass, five pairs of jeans and shirts to go with it. She was about to go, then her mom and dad started looking around, but she had patience when they got home, she was so tired that she is not gone up to her room and fell asleep. And they have lived patiently forever. I made this story to say you have to be patient and wait, that's how accidents and problems happen and this little girl got everything she wanted one thing, she got patience.
I was at Detrait airport. It was around @ NUM1 am, the sky was clear and dark but no rain, just a warm breeze blowing in my face. My mom, brother and @ CAPS1 through the tall metal doors and saw everything from gift shops to our destiny where we would have @ NUM2. We took our tickets and got on the plane. Pink and brown belt.I slipped back and started walking.When we got on the plane, we passed a lot of people that I did'nt know.I was the window seat , and my mom, my brother, and I sat in carnined blue chair waiting in excitement and fear to fly away in the sunshine state
Patience is a very important quality of life. In fact once I had to be very patient because my little cousin who lives @ LOCATION1 had adobe since he was born. It takes a little longer for her to figure things out because she @ MONTH1 where she would but that is not the reality. So I was going to teach her to ride a bike with spinning wheels but she gave it a try and she still knows how she got better today but still has brain issues. So I make it go from awful to better to good to awesome. She has improved over the years, it takes patience as she has a disorder. So you don't really yell at her because she's very emotional and sensitive, so you need to be calm, kind and have patience. So she will still be stuck with the problem but you can be patient and she will @ CAPS1.
Yesterday I went to the orthodontist and waited for my exam. @ CAPS1 took a little while but @ CAPS1 was my next turn. When I got home, I felt like I was starving. I waited until dinner was ready, but even though @ CAPS1 was only an hour before @ CAPS1 was ready, @ CAPS1 seemed like @ CAPS1 was a lifetime. The aroma of delicoas coming from the kitchen only made my hunger worse, but I sat thoughtfully and read my book until @ CAPS1 was done. After a few words, I was watching ghost hunters when my little brothers walked in and started cleaning up the mess they were making with their toys. So I had to suspend the show because there is nothing they can do when the @ CAPS2 is on. So patiently I waited @ NUM1 excruciating minutes until they were done. So overall I think I was very patient yesterday.
This was the time when I was a patient before going to the doctor. It was two days before I was due to see the doctor. My mother told me that I needed three injections, I never liked injections because they hurt and make you sleepy. I usually never have a patient but this time I did. I had one more day and then I will be at the doctor's office. I understand why people should be patient and it is easy to do. Today was my doctor's appointment and I was scared. When I walked into the clinic, I always filled myself up sick and tired. My mom will go and sign my name and I will be sicker because I worry about how many hits I will have to receive. My doctor called me and I was terrified, my mom always told me it didn't hurt if you didn't look at him. So I went back to the doctor's office and my doctor told me to step on the scale, I was really he gave me a hearing test and an eye test. I asked if I should take pictures, he said not yet, but maybe I should. When I finished my hearing test, I was done and I was scared for nothing. When I got home I learned two lessons, one was not to worry about anything and I was learning to have patients. It was then that I was patient before going to the doctor.
This @ DATE1 me, @ CAPS1 mom and @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, all went to A @ ORGANIZATION1 ', @ CAPS1 mom was not very excited, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 was only excited just to see' @ PERSON1 ', I was very excited just to go @ CAPS4, we entered the parking lot to the sound of '@ ORGANIZATION2 music @ CAPS5' @ CAPS6 was a huge queue at the door, it took up half of the parking lot! But we had to wait in this line for an hour before entering. When we walked in and to our seats. It started to rain and of course it was at an outdoor concert. So by the time the opening act was done, I was soaked. Then people started setting up the stage for The '@ ORGANIZATION1'. We waited another hour and a half for them to finish settling in. @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS1 mom were both irritated, I kept waiting and staying positive. On the positive side, it was an amazing gig and @ CAPS7 are glad we had the experience, but next time @ CAPS7 throws hats off !
One time when I was sick was when my brother, and my sister, and I said that we were going @ LOCATION1; This is a big deal for us .My brothers and sisters and I fought in the kitchen about something stupid of course, when all at once our parents we called to ". @ Awesome CAPS1. " I thought. As I thought the punishment that we would receive, my mother broke my thinking and we have said that we were going on vacation." @ CAPS2 punishment ", I asked. " What ? "has answered my mother. " @ CAPS3 "I told him. We were leaving on vacation to @ LOCATION3 and to @ LOCATION2. But we had to wait a whole week. Every day my brother asked" when are we going on a trip ? " and every day my mom would say the high thing. " In a week, in four days, in three days, in two days. @ CAPS4 it was the day to go on vacation and my parents were proud of me for being very patient for a week while waiting to go to @ LOCATION 3. It was a time when I was very patient.
One time I was patient was when I was at my dad's office. We stayed there for an hour. And be patient until we go. It was not easy to be patient. I must have taken a whole hour without saying anything. Until my dad told me too.
My father is sometimes very patient. When he's not angry.
Once I was patient, it was a few days ago. I was standing in line at the @ ORGANIZATION1 store with my mom so we could return a box that wasn't working. This was the third time we had to return these boxes. I had to stand in line for half an hour and only look at angry customers. Always @ CAPS1 was not our turn online. This man at the counter wasn't very patient at all actually, when he left he slammed the door and mumbled stuff under his breath. Finally @ CAPS1 was our turn and my mom was very patient with the employee (even though she didn't want to be) the employee didn't know what was wrong with the box so she got her gave a new one and off we went. Being patient can bring good things just like that quote I always like @ CAPS1 says "good things come to those who wait" @ CAPS1 is very true so remember! Be patient.
The Thompson @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 volleyball players lost our tournament. We went on @ DATE1 to a restaurant @ CAPS3. And you know @ PERSON1. She had asked for chopsticks and the @ CAPS1 made us wait @ NUM1 minutes for the chopsticks. So @ CAPS4 a volleyball player asked and gave it to everyone except adults ! We had so much fun. I had asked for towels but we did not get any.
An important skill that you need in life is patience. With my new hard cast on my arm, there wasn't much I could do. I was a very active kid playing soccer, basketball, cross country, and soccer. But, with my broken arm, I had to be patient with my sports. Being patient paid off and my arm healed faster without becoming but even better. Then I played sports after I had my coat cut. Patience can be rewarding, just if you wait long enough.
I was waiting for my grandfather to come home. He went to an aumish sale to find me a henhouse for my chickens. I was helping my grandmother can. I maring it. I was so excited for him. Go home. Then I went out. I was working to pass the time. I cleaned the barn first. Then I made the cattle @ CAPS1 I fed them, I walked them, then I watered them, then I cleaned the hen house. Then I made chicken @ CAPS1. I collected the eggs. I fed them and I watered them. then I had fun, I worked on volleyball. Then I practiced hitting and pitching for softball. Then I worked on shooting hoops. Then I rode the gator for a little while. Then I went for @ CAPS2. When I came back I thought what can I do. Then I saw the ??? hill. I know I would have some ???. So I got out of the slasher and went to the field @ CAPS3 fighting. I loaded the track on. Then, when I came out the other tractor and I attached the head to do, I went out and I worked on the ground, when I came back, I thought that I should do @ CAPS4, when I hear the same and shoot it was my grandfather. We take the road to the city.
Once when I was patient I was playing a soccer game with my friends and the other team was making us. But even if we lost I still managed to stay calm and we ended up beating them, @ NUM1
Patience is a difficult but good thing to have, as patience can help you move forward in your life, for example by finding a job. One way you should be patient when trying to get a job is when the boss is ??? your essence has landed its sweet time. You don't want to get impatient and yell at him and tell him to hurry as that will prevent you from getting the job. So in conclusion, patience is a good skill to have because it can help us move forward in life.
Just be patient, lucie told @ CAPS1. I'll be done soon. How long is it for ? Wing. I'll be done filling out the paperwork in about an hour, and then I'll take you to the park for an hour? it's so long. Just go watch TV. but I don't want to leave myself alone or when I'm done I won't take you to the park okay. So @ CAPS1 when and placed video games with his little sister @ PERSON1 for a while, and made pizza, then his friend from school came over and asked if he and his sister wanted to go to the park with him and him and his mother. So he asked Lucie if he could go to the park with Ryan and she said yes, just come back at five. and he and @ PERSON1 had a great time. and Ryan's mom gave them all the ice cream. and he learned that being patient is very, very important.
I've been to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1 before, my family and I have been there about a year ago. There were so many rides! we were amazed at the number of people who they belonged . My family and I first decided to do the little rides. We went over things like the "@ CAPS2 trap", "@ CAPS3 star". Also many water rides. At the end of the day, my family and I walked in a row to the biggest hike ever for them. It was called the " woods @ CAPS4 ". The trail was made of wood which is what made most of the ride scary. Their line of prolly @ NUM1 people. I told my mom I didn't want to wait long. She said "it takes patience" I said okay! It was the ride, it was quite fun. After we got down I said ' mom this patience really paid off '.
When I got my bow I was very, very, very excited. Well I was excited because my older sister @ PERSON1 bowed to me and I thought it was unfair. I had to wait @ NUM1 all year until I got my arc on time @ CAPS1. Well my mom and dad are hiding it in my bedroom in my closet, never noticed it before. This is the time when I had to be skated when I had to wait to have my bow. Now, almost every day, I'm out there to film it. Thanks for listening and reading.
Let me make one thing clear ... I am not patient. I mean, I can be sometimes but. Especially since I am not. If there is something happening @ CAPS1 on my birthday, I won't stop taking it or thinking about it. By not being patient I just mean I can't wait. Most of the time… @ CAPS1 when we go to a boring family home I can wait.
Fade @ CAPS1 One day @ CAPS13 sister and I just woke up a shiny @ DATE1 @ TIME1. @ CAPS5 was at the door @ CAPS13. The light shone through the @ CAPS13 cartains and @ CAPS13 covers. @ CAPS5 pushed the door just a crack and said: "@ CAPS2" "@ CAPS3", I stood up moaning "@ CAPS4 me up. I'm sleeping." @ CAPS5 helped me up and gave me a hug as I searched, I went into the living room. @ CAPS5 was in the kitchen and got what I thought was a paper hen, but @ CAPS19 was aluminum. Stunned I turned on the TV even though I didn't know @ CAPS13 mom was in the bus. "@ CAPS6, go put the clothes in the diver", called ?? "@ CAPS7.K." I ??, "(@ CAPS8 want to go down the stairs to." "@ CAPS9" he exclaimed. "@ CAPS10 'I thought in @ CAPS13's head. We went down the stairs in the ?? to the laundry room when we were done putting the clothes in the dryer I took a deep breath and said “Do you smell that?” @ CAPS5 looked scared and said “ @ CAPS9 I'm up to something. "@ CAPS13 my eyes widened and I ran up the stairs until I reached the landing where the door was. I opened @ CAPS19 and @ CAPS14 for me. pushed outside hare coms. "@ CAPS10 air!" We joined. We were back and crawled into the kitchen. We stopped to look at the fire; we ran over to @ CAPS17 still on the couch sleeping. We shook and shook her but @ CAPS5 didn't wake up so I said "cover your ears. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh !!!" "@ CAPS16 evil with you!" @ CAPS17 shouted . "The @CAPS 1, fire, @ CAPS18 @ CAPS19 ! "I screamed. @ CAPS5 got up, we ran, @ CAPS5 grabbed a cup of water and poured @ CAPS19 on the @ CAPS1. “I have to teach you how to cook better or until you don't get over anger!” I said.
There are @ NUM1 different languages in the world and different ??? of these languages, in anything more than @ NUM2 different languages. But in every language the patient means the same, understanding and tolerant. Everyone must have been patient at one point or another, let me tell you ??? once I was patient. Just over a week ago I got into a fight with my best friend in the world. And later that day I realized we were both. I emailed her, texted her and called her cell phone and her landline at least @ NUM3 times @ CAPS1 either did not answer or did not answer. I was all the more frustrated that @ CAPS1 ignored me, then told my cousin about it. "You have to be patient with her, this is your first fight." @ CAPS1 told me in a calm voice. so i waited on the phone to see if @ caps1 called me back without swearing, and i left her alone at school. Finally, one day @ CAPS1 spoke to me. @ CAPS1 said “I'm sorry too, thanks for being patient with me. I missed going out with you, what if we sit in the band together? “ I would live that. ” Replayed and finally caught up after five days From experience I have learned that being patient pays off So wait your turn @ NUM3 speak up and understand why people say what they say and think what they think Patience is always hey.
The time I was patient was when I had to clean my house and my mom said I wish I did ??? when she comes back. So I vacuumed while spreading my bed to clean the bathroom getting the dogs out cleaning their crow doing the dishes taking out the trash doing the laundry and once I had done a lot I would watch @ CAPS1 play game or on the computer i waited on it all day and once she got it she didn't bring it when she said i forgot so we had to have pizza.
One time I was patient was when I was in the doctor's office. I was waiting for my doctor to come out. But it took a long time to get out and I was ??? be patient so hard to keep calm andy then the doctor came out and i started to feel better.
One day my friend @ PERSON1 and I were at @ ORGANIZATION2 and we were in line for @ ORGANIZATION1. We ran to the line and had to wait about half an hour before getting on. But the good thing is that me and @ PERSON1 have been patient. After the ride, we lined up for @ CAPS1 ! WOW! What a queue, I think we were in that queue for at least an hour and a half before getting on. But you know me and @ PERSON1 are really patient. The @ CAPS2!
One day my father needed his keys and I had them. Her keys were certain were in my room so I looked at all of them. After twenty minutes, I still couldn't find them but my father was still patient: I destroyed my room in search of his keys, they were not in my dresser, my closet, my bed or on my floor . I had them just to unlock the car and now the keys are gone and then when I went to tell my dad who has been so patient for an hour I found them in my pocket.
Once apani, there were children, one was called @ CAPS1, he was not at all patient. The other child was called @ PERSON1 he was patience. They went for a walk in the woods and got lost @ CAPS1 kept complaining. @ PERSON1 told him to stop complaining @ CAPS3 @ CAPS1 didn't until he said a hunted house @ CAPS1 told @ PERSON2 to want to come in with him. @ CAPS3 @ PERSON1 didn't want to come in so @ CAPS1 came in and acted like he got hurt so @ PERSON1 ran in there the dorslamd closed and the door nob felt bad. They were afraid it would be dark. Then the light came on. @ CAPS1 said let's get out of here ! @ PERSON1 explained how the button on the door fell. @ CAPS1 said i didn't know they had run although the house had no other doors or windows they were terrified then a ghost came towards them and he said happy @ CAPS7 it was there daddy he built the house for them and said all you had to do was push the door open. and they all returned home. the end
Patience. If you are like me, it is almost impossible. In fact, I can hardly wait @ NUM1 hours for something. But I still have patience sometimes. Like when I wait for a @ CAPS1 party, I can manage. But this story is different. It was a hot day, even though @ DATE1 was almost over. I didn't care because I was focused on one thing: my @ CAPS1. Like most children, I had waited @ NUM2 days until I got a big pile of presents in front of me. When I woke up that morning, I knew the party was going to take some time yet. I put in some cool video games. I played outside and kinda just crouched down to @ NUM3. I couldn't believe it was only twelve o'clock. To me, it seemed like hours had passed. I had to find something else to do. I decided to go to my friend's house. We played some brutal and tiring soccer games before I decided to go, when I got home I ran to my clock like @ CAPS2 in the headlights @ NUM1: 27. How, I don't know. I still had an hour before my party! The last hour @ MONTH1 seemed like a whole different year to me, but I'm still alive, right ? My friends don't know I have patience and neither do I. And believe me. I will never be so patient again. Never.
When I was pashit, I did my math @ CAPS1. I figured out that the @ DATE1 my ant did it @ CAPS2 me at all I @ CAPS3 stopped at this point but this time I was pashit and @ CAPS4 and me @ CAPS5.
This is the story of a time when I was patient. One time I was patient was when I was at the grocery store waiting for my food. I ordered my food and they took the time to give it to me. I waited so patient. Other people were ??? in ??? the ??? they still haven't given me mine, so I went out and told my grandpa they were about to feed me. I told him this because he kept asking me why they were taking so long. So I went back to the grocery store and asked them why are you taking so long, they said it was happening in a second. Then I sat in the grocery store and watched and so did my friends walking into the grocery store. So we started to talk and wait patiently for the food. Their names are @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2, @ PERSON1. My name is @ CAPS3, I was born on @ DATE1, I grew up in the city of @ LOCATION1 oit. I was patient because I didn't get angry and waited. So they called me and said my food was ready. Then I took my food and told my friends I was going to come home, after which I left. This is the story of a time when I was patient.
One day I was looking at a catalog in a store and saw a goalie jersey that I really wanted. So I went to my mom and showed her what I wanted. She said it was a bit pricey, but she would get it. The following week was very long, the wait for the jersey. On @ DATE1 he came, pale yellow, red, blue and purple. I finally had a goalkeeper jersey to wear for the games and make some great saves.
One time I was patient was when I was waiting for my dad to come home. Work so I could cook my package that I received before it left for a three day trip out of state, so when it came back I moved to open it.
One time I had to be patient was my birthday @ NUM1. Why because I was waiting for my phone and mom told me that I was going to have it on the first day of @ DATE1. But I still couldn't believe her and guess what my last gift was my brand new cell phone and a case now that's what I call pacent.
" Are they still there ?" " I say in making round trips. " Patience, it takes time to get out of the locker from all the way down " said @ CAPS1 " @ CAPS2 ! @ CAPS6 on the camera ! " " @ CAPS3 got it ! " said @ PERSON1 "@ CAPS4 is right behind us." “ @ CAPS5 funny guys ! You better give me my clothes back or I swear I'll be leaving @ camera CAPS6 ! " Shouted @ @ CAPS4 CAPS7 while trying to grab his clothes ... and missed. “@ CAPS8 ! My patience is exhausted @ CAPS7 ! ” I said while taking another photo “@ CAPS10, I think @ CAPS3 should put this on the Internet.” I continued ”@ CAPS11 ! You can @ CAPS5 put this on the Internet ! " " So you'll stop harassing us ? " I asked" @ CAPS8 " @ CAPS4 said: "@ CAPS13, so I'm just going to zoom in here." "@ CAPS13 !" @ CAPS4 screamed as her towel fell. So to show how little respect @ CAPS3 had for him, @ CAPS3 gave him his clothes, turned around and walked away.
Crack, I twisted in the air and put my face up with my arm around me. I felt a throbbing pain @ CAPS1 I wavered at my achievement, "what just happened?" I thought to myself that I started to feel the intense pain that went through my forearm again. I bit my lip @ CAPS1 hard @ CAPS1 I could hold back all the tears coming out like a waterfall. My friends started to ask me. if i was ok @ CAPS1 soon @ CAPS1 i started to hold my arm. “I think maybe I broke it,” I replied between jobs, they rushed to get @ CAPS1 help as soon as possible. I quickly found myself in the sick room after calling my parents to alert them to what had just happened. I sat there for hours waiting for my parents to come and pick me up for treatment at the children's hospital. There were both at work and couldn't pick me up @ CAPS1 the day I moaned I got more and more anxious. Finally the bell rang, it was finally @ NUM1. "snap!" the door opened, it was my father and not because behind him was my mother. @ NUM1 is when they come out of work after my mom and dad said how happy they were that it was nothing more than a broken arm, they immediately rushed me to @ LOCATION1. It was my experience of a time when I had to be patient. And in the end, it turned out that I had a broken arm. In life there are going to be many situations where you will need to be patient, all you can do is take life @ CAPS1 as it comes to you.
Jenny and @ PERSON3 were twin siblings. Every year a carnival was held next to their house with games, rides and food. One day @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON1 went politely asking their mom @ PERSON2 for money to go on the Ferris wheel mom, "can we each get a dollar to go on the Ferris wheel". @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1 ,, "of course" @ CAPS1 mom and gave them two dollars. @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON1 were so excited they ran to the Ferris wheel line. They waited and waited an hour and it was finally their turn, meanwhile the man in charge of the Ferris wheel had watched @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON1 queuing. As @ PERSON1 was about to intervene in the casting to signify that the boys pushed them to the ground and took their seats. Now mom taught them to be nice to everyone and they remembered it, so they got up and let them go. When it was their turn again, the Ferris wheel manager noticed what had just happened and told them he was proud of @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON1 and that they would go around the Ferris wheel three times. more for their patients. After the ride they thanked the man and happily ran home to tell their mom what happened, their mom was so proud of them and hugged @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON1.
I have been patient when I hunt because when you have a bow and you can only shoot so far you have to get the deer in a nice clearing and not behind some brush. I think you have to be a patient person because when a deer comes up and you prepare your bow your mind makes you think like you. He's going to approach and then he walks as slowly as he can and you just have to deal with it. And when all that patience comes to an end and you get ready to shoot and you got it, it really pays off.
Once I was patient was when I was at grade @ NUM1. It was after my birthday and I wanted pink shoes @ ORGANIZATION1. My dad at @ LOCATION1 said he would get them but he would have to buy them, send them to grandma's house, then ask my grandma to send them to me and I would get them shortly after my birthday. So one day he called me and told me that he had sent them and that I should receive them in a week. So I patiently waited for my shoes and in a week. They weren't at my house. I didn't want to buy my dad and call him every day about it, so I just waited patiently. After @ NUM2 more week I started to worry and get angry so I called my dad and asked him about the shoes and to my surprise he said my grand- mother would bring my shoes in an hour. So I waited and waited an hour and my shoes still hadn't arrived. At this point, I just decided they would come just when they did and I would just wait. Finally, I got my shoes on the next day and I was static. I thanked my dad and wore my shoes the next day knowing that my patience paid off.
@ CAPS4 I am patient and sometimes I am impatient. But no matter how impatient I am, my @ CAPS5 is even more impatient when it comes to waiting in a big traffic jam. He blows because of the long delay, sighs and becomes very impatient. He says things like @ CAPS1 on, @ CAPS2 "" @ CAPS1 on ! " @ CAPS4 it's scary to be with @ CAPS5 in traffic jams or long queues. But after the long queue. @ CAPS5 is himself again, which is a big relief from my past! "
Once I was patient was when I was fighting my little brother at @ LOCATION1 and then he kicked me in the chin and I promised him I wouldn't talk about him even when I opened my chin the second time he kicked me and I fell to the ground right in front of everyone and then I was swarmed like a bunch of bees around a beehive full of honey. It was then that I was patient.
Once my big brother told me that we were going to go on a micigman adventure, so I would wait for him to come home, then my dad told me that I had to prepare to go, so i like to save my shorts and? ?? ??? that so i did it and then i sat there for about ??? was then I called him and he said ??? ???

@ CAPS12 is the @ CAPS1 of the ninth winner @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 up to @ CAPS4 full account, @ CAPS5 loaded, two out of. As the pitcher throws a fastball @ NUM1 down the middle, @ CAPS2 swung and hit his very first grand slam. The crowd exploded and @ CAPS7 as we were about to leave. CAPS14 agreed. @ CAPS10 the time I got there it was a huge line. As time slowly passed @ CAPS10 minutes sewing like hours. I could see the children getting old. I should @ CAPS11 my dad hadn't said "The only way we ran to stay is @ CAPS11 you're pertiant". @ CAPS12 took forever, all you had to do was look around and you would see children going mad The little ones were crying. I could tell I was maby one of the last five people being patient even my dad was getting frustrated @ CAPS12 took at least two and @ CAPS13 hours to get to the front but @ CAPS12 felt like @ NUM2 days. I @ CAPS14 got the autograph of the whole streetcar and I was so happy. I even supriezd myself that day, had no idea I had @ CAPS12 in me to be this patient for two and @ CAPS13 hours. d stopped at @ CAPS15 and offered me a frosty one, @ CAPS9 said @ CAPS12 was for being patient wasn't that bad @ MONTH1 i will be more patient from now on and @ CAPS16.

One day my mom, sister and I were going to the hair salon to get our hair done. There were so many people talking. It was a bit noisy too. The TV was on, the radio was on, and a bunch of people were talking. When we got there my mom put the three of us on the sign-up sheet and then we had to sit down and wait. We have waited a long time. I really wanted to leave and come back another day, but my mom said we had to wait. I was hungry and I was sleepy. We waited an hour. I didn't let it bother me so I turned on my @ NUM1 reader and listened to it until it was time for us to move on next. Then we had to wait another hour and I got even hungrier but didn't say anything. So we waited and waited and finally we were next. And we all had our hair done. Then when we left we went to get some food because we were all hungry. And that was a time when I was a patient at the barbershop.
Once upon a time there was an offer called jack. Jack and a little brother named @ PERSON1, and was @ NUM1 and jack was @ NUM2. @ CAPS1 since jack was much older than @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS2 was his brother @ CAPS2 had to watch him a lot. Jack had a lot of patients since @ CAPS2 had to watch him every night because his parents were working late. But @ CAPS2 still thought his brother was boring. But see, his parents knew that if they paid him when @ CAPS2 continued to monitor him, then @ CAPS2 did. But one day when Jack's little brother @ PERSON1 kept complaining because @ CAPS2 did n't get what he wanted , Jack finally got angry and said if you don't stop not @ CAPS3 i won't look at you anymore and yes i will go halfway today to care. " @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1 hated daycare so @ CAPS2 quit right away. @ CAPS2 was very angry with his brother because @ CAPS2 was never like that with him. So @ CAPS2 meant @ CAPS2 was sorry and @ CAPS2 did and his brother force-fed him. "I'm sorry I made you angry. " @ CAPS2 said. " @ CAPS3 is fine, "his brother said. " @ CAPS4 is trying not to let @ CAPS3 happen again, "@ CAPS2 said. Then the next day when Jack and his little brother were hanging out school everything went well. "I'm glad we're not mad because I don't want to go to daycare," @ PERSON1 said to her brother. "Yeah and I don't want you leave because then I won't have to do anything, ”@ CAPS2 said. The @ CAPS5
There was a time when I went to @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1. We were driving to @ ORGANIZATION1 then there was a long line of traffic so we had to wait. So we waited on a bridge @ NUM1! It was a night that was coming true. We are hungry. We really didn't give any compliments. But we had been there a long time, around @ NUM2, we got into the pig. So we decided which roller coaster to continue on. We decided to go to the @ CAPS1. We looked at the line, it was a @ NUM3 hour wait. We stood in line. @ PERSON1, @ PERSON1 and my brother @ PERSON1 were accompanied a lot. Once again, it was a nightmare coming true. So my dad and I were okay with the line for the @ CAPS2. In fact, it didn't take as long as I thought it would. After the wait, we got on the roller coaster. We were laughing and scared at the same time. The coaster was finished. I was sad. But it was worth the three hour wait. Later that day we rode the @ CAPS3, the first standing coaster ever built. I was still worried that the wait had lasted @ NUM4 hours. And @ PERSON1 and my brother @ CAPS4 dying of waiting. But the wait only lasted an hour. I was afraid of this coaster. But I loved it. It was a lot of fun to ride a roller coaster. We left after a while. It was a long day. The end.
In this story, I'm waiting for a cabin just as the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 video game arrived for @ CAPS3 @ NUM1. The game will be the last game for the bunsie comcay. I already have it and it is coming. I'm pretty good, but I don't understand why your mother character stays on a plant called @ CAPS2 and is the only comsnap there, and of all the left character gets pushed around by aliens @ NUM2 coughing with swords and they chop your customize it to buy size coins with small plastic swords. And the first time I went to buy the ones from @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 to @ NUM3, the parking lot was probably full of all the @ NUM4 year olds who live in their mother's basement. So we waited and got it about @ NUM5 week after I was allowed to. We bought it then we get more details and it wasn't the fight that gave, it was a week @ PERSON1 game so categorized it in two minutes, so it's not staying patient.
When I was in fifth grade I wasn't doing very well in math, so my @ CAPS1 agreed to help study for my next test. So on @ DATE1 I got up really early, but my mom was late coming home from work and she drove me there. So my @ CAPS1 was really understanding and patient. So my mom came home and drove me home and we ended up an hour and a half late but my @ CAPS1 was still very patient. So we started to help me and I was completely lost I didn't understand anything she was talking about but she was trying anyway and was very understanding. I was wrong on almost all of the questions she asked me and she always tries her best to help me understand them. She must have helped me for about @ NUM1 hours but she followed up and really helped me and I actually got an A on this quiz for her help and patience with me. I know it must have been difficult to work with me for so long without losing patience with me and I really respect that and am very grateful to know someone like that.
Once I was patient it was @ DATE1, @ NUM1, @ NUM2. I was sitting doing my measurement test when my stomach started to hurt. For about @ NUM3 minutes I just sat there moving around. Then I raised my hand to ask to call my mom. When I called I asked him and @ CAPS3 said "@ CAPS1.S @ PERSON1 can you take ??? to the office." And @ PERSON1 said ok. Then me and @ PERSON1 went to the office and called my landline, my sister picked up the phone, I said "@ CAPS2 I'm talking to mom. @ CAPS3 said "wait. Then my mum said" how are you ". I said mum, can you please come and get me, my stomach is hurting a lot. @ CAPS3 said" ok "and hung up. I waited about @ NUM3 minutes sitting the patient, throwing and turning from my stomach which was aching so badly. Then finally called Agian "I said mom you are coming" @ CAPS3 said "@ CAPS4 on my way. " I said" ok "and hung up. I was sitting there patient and in pain until my mom finally walked through the school doors and logged me out of @ CAPS3 which said" Come on "my sister and ??? were sitting in the truck waiting to go to the family health center. I sat in the front seat. I slept all the way home and then woke up when we got there. When I arrived, I entered the house lying on the sofa and fell asleep.
My mother is a patient person. Once when I was little, I got chewing gum stuck in my hair. I cried a lot and moved around as my mom patiently tried to get the gum out of my hair. She kept telling me to stay seated, but she never got mad at me, even though she had really wanted to stop and get me out on my own. When she couldn't get it out and said she should, I screamed. Tet, with patience, she was able to cut the gum and keep my hair looking good even though I didn't want to sit still. I think my mom is the most patient person I know because every time something happens she's patient about it.
Once I was patient, it was when I was at the dentist to have a cavity filled. When we got there they said my date wasn't for someone else ??? but my mother didn't want to leave. I was so ???

A learning experience is ??? learned to be patient when someone takes too long to do nothing
Beep! Beep! Beep! My alarm clock was ringing and it was @ NUM1 and I already missed the bus ! Rushing out of bed, I quickly dressed. Hoping my brother and sister were downstairs all ready to wait for me. Oh no! They weren't downstairs! Running up the stairs like the house is on fire I went to my brother's room and yelled "@ CAPS1! @ CAPS1! @ CAPS4 already missed the bus. I don't want to go straight into my sister's room. Shouting the same, she quickly got out of bed and got dressed. Coming down the stairs, thinking everything was going to be okay. I made breakfast. Then my sisters are gone. ran down. She shouted at her food : "@ CAPS1 !" @ CAPS3 at It was @ NUM2 am only @ NUM3 minutes more so I started making my breakfast. My brother is not yet Going down. Finishing my breakfast, I went up the stairs and woke my @ CAPS7 and my brother. They came down behind me. My brother just had his jelly breakfast : @ CAPS4 now that @ CAPS4 was late. @ CAPS3 on time it was @ NUM4 only @ NUM5 minutes ! "@ CAPS4 don't go do it" I said. e was hoping in the van and @ CAPS7 was driving. We are at school. My sister and I were shouting, “@ CAPS1 ! Hit the mushroom! ” @ CAPS7 ignored that my brother didn't really care if @ CAPS4 was late or not. Then finally @ CAPS4 was only @ NUM6 minutes late. I think my brother is the only patient in the homes.
There was a child named @ PERSON2 who was always very patient. He always waited for everything else and he never complained. That morning @ PERSON2 just woke up, as did his five siblings. They were all trying to get ready for school within an hour. All the bathrooms were occupied, but @ PERSON2 did not complain that he used this time to clean his room and make his bed. @ PERSON2 was a little late for school. The teacher @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1 said come over here and the class said ooooo !!! Ha! Ha! @ PERSON2 is in trouble. @ PERSON1 said come over here and @ PERSON2 put his head down and walked like he was pulling a ton. During lunch, @ PERSON2 was on the phone. Once @ PERSON2 got up there, the food was gone, everything was gone. The lunch lady saw how upset he was and offered him a special lunch. After @ PERSON2 got home, his family threw a party for the patients. @ PERSON2 was honored and also happy. Last night has been the best for @ PERSON2
As my father always told me, the patient is one of the factors that make you successful in life. As I mature, I find more and more that patients are important. I remember a time when I had to post patients for a long time. My family and I took a trip to Ceadar Point with my friend. My friend and I could only think of the biggest ride in the park, mellenium @ ORGANIZATION1. “@ CAPS1 ride gave me the most fans, the most breathtaking and awesome adrenaline pumping ever. But it would be a while before I could ride it. So we walked and walked, I started to tire. After @ NUM1 hours of walking we reached the mellenium @ ORGANIZATION1. I was disappointed to find out that this was a @ NUM1: 30 hour wait. The sun was shining . I think the best way @ CAPS1 was to stay calm and relax. It seems the more you complain, the longer it takes. And before we knew it, we were about to start the stroll !
"@ CAPS1 hour and thirty minutes, you're kidding !" I said my dad and I entered the " Maverick " queue at dot @ CAPS2. "That's what the sign says, but it might take longer," replied my father. I said in a disappointed tone " I guess we can wait ", but in my head I remembered that you have zero, zipo, none, no patience ! Why did I say yes. Just when my thoughts were done, the line went up a bit. It was quick I thought. During that time until the line moved again, I had been busy watching people on the @ CAPS3 and other rides go by. The line has gone up again. People watching didn't work this time around so I was thinking how fun the Maverick would be to ride, and the other rides I wanted to do next. These thoughts lasted halfway. My patience was at an end. I started to think about how close school was, how much I wanted to go back, how much I didn't want to go back, what I would miss and what I was looking forward to. We were almost there, but I was losing my patience every second. I started patting my fingers on the side of my leg. I didn't think anything and just patted my fingers and moved up. We were finally in front, and I didn't complain once! I sat down and the ride began. In the end, I was totally worth it, I thought. Now was the time to do more rides and not to complain. It was a time when I was patient
I once was patient as we went to @ LOCATION1 for one of my baseball tournaments. It's like an hour's drive from @ NUM1 threw @ LOCATION2 and that's how we went, I was sitting in the back of the car and had an earache so my ear was warm and had to wait @ NUM1 hours. Another reason is that my little brother @ PERSON1 was trying to grab my feet, grab his stuffed animal and hit me with it. I was telling him to stop and he wouldn't if I finally took the stuffed animal and he was screaming at me to give it back then I would. The last reason is that we had to wait @ NUM3 minutes at a stretch to be able to return to @ LOCATION3 from @ LOCATION2. Then when we were in the front row a guy asked my mom a question and he asked my two brothers and I who were the two people in the front seat and we said “ are mom and dad ”. He asked for this to make sure we weren't kidnapped. These are all the reasons I had to be patient at @ NUM1 hour's drive to town from @ ORGANIZATION1.
A lot of people are patient and wait because they don't want to make someone angry or ruin something they're doing. People are always careful about what they are doing. Sometimes I'm patient and it's not that hard to be patient, it's pretty easy. Everyone knows it absolutely, these people are out of their minds, they know it, believe me. There are a lot of different things that I've been patient with, but I'm not sure which one I chose to write about because there are a lot of them. "@ CAPS1 someone is in the bathroom, wait patiently but @ CAPS1 you can't or can't hold it, keep knocking on the door or just use another one, or @ CAPS1 someone on the computer then wait your turn, but @ CAPS1 it's past in an hour, then tell that person to get off so you don't be mean but you either have to get on and have your turn. There's no way not to be patient for at least @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 minutes Not too hard It's pretty easy and everyone knows it too, you know it.
I will write about a time when I was patient. The time I was patient was when I was going to blur and it took a long time. It took @ NUM1 minutes. It seemed to have taken forever. It was an @ ORGANIZATION1. I think the reason it seemed like forever was probably because I wasn't eating anything. There was me, my mother and my father. You can also buy ice cream. I had a stomach ache and I was hungry. I had tried. Some people have the patient and some don't. I sort of have patients. But this time, I had no patients. Now when I get an @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 it doesn't seem that long. It was a time when I needed patients.
One time I was patient was at the start of the seventh year. It was the fourth hour and the principal had made an announcement that the sixth graders were taking too long to eat lunch and said there was a delay. As the rest of the class complained, I sat there calm and patient. It wasn't much fun just sitting there bored and hungry, so I just kept my cool. Then finally our class was called down to lunch. This is the time when I was patient for something.
My mom was patient when she waited in line for her driver's license, it took three hours for her to get her driver's license. She was angry but she was patient. And the lady who would give the driver's license paused when she came back my mom waited another three hours and she was still patient I was there too and I was patient but wanted to yell at the lady for doing a break and made us wait an hour longer. And another time my mom stood in line under the rum, it was burning.
The time I wasn't patient. On the day of @ DATE1 I got out of bed brushed my teeth ate and ate a break feast, then me, mom and brother went to the doctor. Whitch is an hour from our house. I wasn't happy because I was tired and I was just thinking how long @ CAPS1 was going to sit while waiting for the doctor to say @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 but no I was able to sit them looking at the walls. So I know I was here and @ CAPS1 so happy to sit back and wait because my mom has told me a thousand times " you gotta stop being so unpatient ", well I can help him. Anyway, my mom just signed up for me so I guess I'll just watch the boring boring boring magizeens. They don't even have people who magizeee "come on", I said my mom said "you gotta wait @ CAPS1 sure they'll call your name anytime", well not anytime because that was about boring @ NUM1 min. ooh look here at lunchtime but no we still have to sit here and wait. My God, I'm so hungry. Finally, the doctor just called me and there is still time to wait! In conclusion, at a time when I was not patient, I was not patient while waiting for the doctors to be seated, so if it has anything to do with the expectation " I am not interested. "
Once upon a time there were two boys named @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ PERSON1. @ ORGANIZATION1 was abnovius and always had to time it his way. @ PERSON1 was still taking her turn with something and sharing. One day watching @ CAPS1.V. they saw a rocket building kit and asked their dad they wanted it. His father called the phone ??? and ???, I ??? the world takes @ CAPS2 weeks. When @ ORGANIZATION1 ??? it was @ CAPS2 weeks it ??? in shape. On the other hand, @ PERSON1 said that @ CAPS3's dad went to see his ???. Country would be ??? and @ ORGANIZATION1 would always be @ CAPS4 daddy ??? around because he couldn't @ CAPS1 wait. @ PERSON1 just took it as if it was ??? daytime. @ ORGANIZATION1 would be sitting next to the ??? and look at the ??? the ??? with his locked. Finally, the day has come. @ ORGANIZATION1 ran out and picked up his rocket ???. At this time @ PERSON1 ??? outside. When did they get the rockets ??? they opened them. @ ORGANIZATION1 was disappointed because he wanted to play now but had to build it first. @ PERSON1 took his time following step by step instructions and his rocket was not finished. @ ORGANIZATION1 just crammed pieces together and came out twisted and broke. @ ORGANIZATION1 cried out terribly. @ PERSON1 went to @ ORGANIZATION1 and said he would help and in @ NUM1 minutes they were done. Together they played and had fun. The end.
Lost in @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1 was at the start of @ DATE1, the leaves were just starting to change color and hover above your head. My mom, sister, a friend of hers, and the mall all piled into the car and drove a few minutes to @ ORGANIZATION1, which was literally in our backyard. I had my camera and am very thorough in taking a picture of @ CAPS2. My mom and the others were very patient with me, allowing me to be slow on the hike. The problem with @ PERSON1 is that there aren't a lot of trail maps so you can easily get lost or get lost. After a long hike, we come to a people on the road where there was a map. My mom checked her cell phone and told us we had forty-five minutes until we had to take our new kitten to the vet. I suggested we start heading home so we can get home in time to pick up the kitten and arrive on time, allowing the long drive to the vets. My mom, instead of taking my advice, took us in a whole different direction. My sister and her friend complained of dragging their feet. For the next mile we continued without finding a map. My sister and I became more and more frustrated with my mom and being lost. Because we got lost in the monotonous field and trees, my mom had to pull out her dying cell phone and call my dad to take my kitten to the vet. I couldn't wait to take it, which stressed me even more. Finally, after another half an hour of walking, we found ourselves at the exit. I was glad I almost kissed the car. @ CAPS2 went well and my mom was always patient with us, we complained and moaned.
One time I was patient was when I was in science class taking a test. I was patient because I went to see the teacher because I needed help and the child in front of me too. It took him a while, but I stayed there and waited. It took him about @ NUM1 minutes as he needed help with a lot of things. It was then that I was patient.
I have a few friends who sometimes ask me for help with something like schoolwork or homework. Some of them take a long time to explain and I have to be patient to help them. And I'm going to be realistic, not everyone has a lot of patience and is not easily frustrated, like me sometimes. And sometimes I was on the phone for an hour trying to explain homework to a friend of mine. Soon I will have patience again when I am tutor for @ CAPS1. For me, patience is one of the most important characteristics that a person can have.
I am not a very patient person. But when I have to be, I am. For example, in my house, we only have one bathroom. I hate to wait to go. But I have to wait because I don't want to pee in the jungle so I'll wait. I also have to wait for my bust. I hate waiting, it's so boring. But patience is a good thing to have. If we didn't, there would be a lot of deaths from car crashes, murders, nervous breakdowns. My sister is very patient, she can wait in one place for hours once it was @ CAPS1. She waited for her hair, I complained, that's one of the reasons why patience is important.
Flave, have you ever gone to see the saying? Well @ DATE1 my brother, sister and I got the role of a dictor, we are missing school. When we got there it was full of people. So we sat down and waited. We waited three and a half hours so I started to lack patience and got hungry to tell my mom I was hungry and everyone agreed with me. So my mom went to the food court to get us the money. Pizza and water. When we were done with our pizza, we waited another three hours. I started to get angry because we had been here for hours. Finally the nigger told kimderly my mom so we get up and then she said @ PERSON1. So I got so un-patient that I screamed and said "@ CAPS1 this is our term we have been waiting here for a long time I can't wait @ CAPS1 anymore" my mom ended me up come down and said sorry for my rude behavior. When I sat down and started to wait, in a second it was our tern. This is why patience is very important
Patience is one of the most important things in life. Patience is being understanding and tolerant. For example, a mother of children has gone to work, she takes @ NUM1 hours and she comes home. The kid said "it was quick". This is patience.
For me, I'm not that patient that if someone shuts something on me or one of my friends I go after them, I don't tolerate my friends being chosen by someone they do not even know or that I do not know t know. One time ago, my friends and I were walking down the hallway of the school. This kid doesn't seem to know and starts pushing my friend and I asked the kid what his problem was and he said it wasn't my fault. to pick on me but he didn't know I had my brother and other friends around the corner of the building so I asked my only friend who was right next to me to go and get them , so he did and the kid who was picking out a gun I ran away.
One time I was patient was when my mom's car needed a new battery and I had to go to school. My mother called her friend who lived down the street to come and give us a hand. We waited an hour and a half while waiting for him. My mom called her back and she said she couldn't come because she needed an oil change. After that we walked to the bus stop for thirty minutes, he picked us up and took us to @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ PERSON1. Then we hiked the rest of the way to @ NUM1 mile and @ PERSON1 where another bus was that took us to @ NUM2 mile and @ PERSON1 where my school is. It was the time when I was patient.
Patience is waiting for something. As we can tell, your new shoes will become in two weeks instead of worrying all the time. you walk like Honnel. For example, to hunt, you sit down and wait for a deer to come. If you were hospitalized, you would go get it. Sometimes a lot of people can get patient about something and get mean. To be patient is to understand why it takes time for something. You have to keep if it doesn't come on the @ DATE1 that it is supposed to. This time I had a date @ CAPS1 at @ TIME1 and my mom and I had to wait until five. And we never got mad just a little board. This time a friend of mine was waiting for his dad to come home only on @ DATE1
Patience is when you calmly wait for something, someone, or something to happen. When I was little I went to the doctor to get the shot, but mom didn't tell me it was for an injection, so I thought I was just going in and out with a suction cup. I had asked my mom when I could get a sucker and she told me to wait a bit to be patient. I walked into the room and took the hit and got my suction cup. I was angry with my mom because she knows I hate needles.
A beaker bubbled up in the lab @ LOCATION1. I could smell the smell of sulfur coming out of the beaker. "@ CAPS1 what's going on !" I shouted across the room "@ CAPS2 has found the cure for cancer!" @ CAPS3 stated that @ CAPS3 had a little jubilee dance that @ CAPS3 showed. I am a doctor and I was not so sure but told him I had a patient with extreme brain cancer. "@ CAPS4 will try it!" @ CAPS3 shouted. As I zoomed in on the car and waited for @ CAPS3 to put away his lab equipment. After @ NUM1 minutes, I was wondering where @ CAPS3 could be. @ CAPS3 just struggles to pack, I say. So I turned on the radio and fell asleep. After a few hours, I woke up in shock. I had slept @ NUM2 ½ hours! I rushed inside to find him holding a ball of fur wrapped in his lab coat. "I saved this kitten's life with my cancer cure." @ CAPS3 said breathlessly. I was glad I was patient, otherwise the kitten would not have lived. Just when I was thinking how good it was that @ CAPS3 had saved the kitten, my pager rang. @ PERSON1, the lady with extreme brain cancer needed our help. @ CAPS3 received a vial of their cancer solution and we rushed to the hospital. There I saw @ PERSON1 lying there as translucent as light hitting paper. I quickly brought his heart rate down. At that time, I wasn't sure she would live. "@ CAPS6 give it to him ?" asked the mad scientist. I made a risky choice. "@ CAPS7, not yet." I waited five minutes, then poured it out. @ PERSON1 has come back to life. Even though @ PERSON1 couldn't speak, I could tell by her smile that she was very grateful that I was patient. Her daughter came into the room and said, "@ CAPS8 you". I only smiled back.
I am a patient wherever I go to the dentist, orthodontist or doctor's office. The first time is at the dentist when I have to wait to have my teeth cleaned. I usually sit there and finish the magazines. The next place I am patient is the orthodontist, I sit and wait in the first room and crater to my I-pod after a few minutes, the call calls me in the second room where I 'wait a little longer to get my armband scared. Once at the office, I have to wait for the guy to tighten them up. Finally, there is the doctor's office where you sit for a long time in the large waiting room and wait for the lady to call you when you get there. As you can see, a lot of things require patience.
One day, I had to go to the doctor's office to get the vaccine. When we entered the doctor's office, I had to wait in uncomfortable chairs with my father. It was my first time taking pictures and I didn't know how I was feeling. Since I was little, it was more difficult for me to have patience, I just wanted to end it. I kept asking my dad if the doctor was still coming, and my dad always said patience. It got to the point where my dad was so frustrated, and he told me to go play with some toys; that I hadn't noticed until then. But when I saw these fun toys glistening in the sun, I ran towards them. But after a few minutes it got so boring so I went back to sit down. It was getting so boring that I couldn't take it anymore! I wanted to scream! But then I couldn't take it, I started to get so angry, I just wanted to get out of it. But I didn't tell my dad, because I wanted him to think I was patient. I was about to scream as loud as I can, but my doctor came out and said "@ CAPS1", and I was relieved that the doctor finally came to give me the injections. But what I didn't know was that I was going to suffer for a few days.
I play hockey. I am a goalkeeper. A good goal is always patient. In my old hockey team, the other goalie and I faced a lot of @ NUM1 on @ NUM1 shots. Most of the @ NUM1 shots on @ NUM1 didn't matter, but a few did, and they were the hardest to stop. My team had never lost a game but we had a few very close games. In one of the games the score was @ NUM1 to @ NUM6 and my team was in the lead. It was towards the end of the match and they had an @ NUM1 on @ NUM1 against me. The shooter was skating to the side and he cut in the middle of the ice. It was tempting to go down but I stayed standing. I waited for the shooter to get to a point where he had nowhere to go and he shot and stopped him. It was even one of the only shots in the game and I stopped it.
"@ CAPS1 hurry up," said my friend. - I know, be patient, I say. Being patient means being understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences without complaint. One day we played a basketball game at another school. My team and I all used the bathroom. I was the last to enter a stall. They all left and a girl stayed. Being patient is a good thing. Have you ever heard something like “ Patience is a virtue ? Well if you don't get used to it.
Once when someone else I know was patient it was when I stood in line for over an hour to get tickets for the show I was going to see. It shows some patina because I didn't complain while standing in line.
Once was often the best friend I made for a ride, it was so hot outside, but the first ride we did was called @ CAPS1. The line was super long, it was like going through a maze because the rope was tied, we stayed in the line for about forty-five minutes but it felt like two hours. But I didn't really complain, except for my friend, she kept complaining about the heat and fatigue of her big feet, but when we finally got there we started to ride for know how. When we sat on the roller coaster it was so much fun. I think it was worth the wait.
Once I was patient it was when I wanted a Do I. for my birthday. But I couldn't get it because my mother had to pay the rent. So I waited and finally it was my birthday. I didn't have it but then @ NUM1 months went by and it was @ CAPS1 and I got it and I was so happy. @ CAPS2 when I was patient was when I had to keep my cousin for @ NUM2. And I waited a few weeks for my uncle to give me my money but he didn't. So I waited and ?? to give me my money. But not only did he give me @ NUM2, he gave me late fees @ NUM4 and I was happy. And that added to my money my mom gave me and it was @ NUM5 and I went skating and to the store with my friends. And I spent some of it at @ DATE1 ??? and the added @ DATE1 maintained ???. they were then @ CAPS2 time i was patient was when it was @ NUM6 days before my birthday and i was leaving for a slumber party I ??? went to buy everything and it felt like the next day was my birthday @ NUM7. I did everything I had so much fun it felt like Heaven at home.
Patience. Patience is something I have absolutely nothing about! I am taking after my mother in this area. My mom is probably a little worse than me, but we're both pretty bad. Sometimes we record TV shows and watch them later just because we don't want to have to wait for @ CAPS1. Some of the other things I hate waiting are queues, late people, and just plain old people waiting. The longest time I can stay patient is about five minutes, no more than that puts me on the brink. By the way, another thing is long car trips when I have nothing to do. I just wish we could have a @ NUM1 hour drive turn into @ NUM1 minute drive but still end up in the same place. I really wish I had more patience but I don't know how to get it. I really hope you have enough patience to understand my story.
I once had to be really patient. This was when I was going to @ LOCATION1 to see my family. It took four days to get there. It would have taken a couple of days but we stopped a lot. My dad wanted to go to all the shops and restaurants along the way. It drove me a little crazy because we didn't have to go at all but to my dad we did. On our way, it lasted two weeks. My uncle @ PERSON1 called us every five minutes along the way. He kept saying things like how close are you, when are you gonna get here, are you lost, and have you brought me co-coweats? I thought it was really funny. My uncle loves co-coweats. I mean I love them but not that much. When we finally got there, my legs hurt so much from sitting in the back of my dad's car. I walked for two hours to find the sensation in my legs.
The time I was patient was when I went fishing @ CAPS1 with my step dad. I couldn't wait long so I decided to talk to myself or sing songs. My stepdad said you put your pole on a slingshot stand and did anything. So I went to explore the world and thought about how I can be patient. I had to go check my pole and got nothing so I feel on the coast so I sat and waited but until then my pole started to move so I grabbed a big @ CAPS1 I was so happy. My father-in-law said you have patience.
The time, I needed patience. We were at the grocery store, @ CAPS1 man to be exact.m When we got there I was excited because we were going to have a lot of trash but there. We started to have a lot of food and it looked really good. I started to eat everything. The cart was halfway there. ??? @ CAPS7 we had more stuff and it was @ CAPS3 full that we had to get another cart and it started to get hungry. But by the time we were in the meat section, I was hungry. My mom said "@ CAPS2 just got a few things." @ CAPS3 I waited and waited @ CAPS7 she told me to go to checkout. All were long @ CAPS3 and I felt like I was ??? (@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6) @ CAPS7 this little girl walked up to me getting smart I couldn't stand it, I was about to talk to that little girl down. But I had to calm down @ CAPS3, @ CAPS7 I realized it was our turn and I was @ CAPS3 happy. @ CAPS7 when I got home mom cooked some bacos and I was just ready to go to bed.
As I waited at the airport I looked at everyone passing by, pondering these thoughts in my head, " when will @ CAPS2 be around ?" " @ CAPS1 I've been waiting a long time and what time is it, wasn't her flight supposed to be here NUM1 minutes ago ? Then suddenly I heard a soft female voice '@ CAPS2 will be here soon, honey, don't worry.' I don't understand @ CAPS1, my mom told a @ NUM2 year old kid not to worry about our nature. I was about to lose my patience, but then I asked myself "what's the point of complaining?" It just gets on your nerves. @ CAPS3 these things crossed my mind, I regained my patience. An hour later, I felt my mom shake my shoulder and tell me to wake up. When I opened my eyes I saw my father standing in front of me, I ran to him and hugged him. "I almost lost my patient" @ CAPS4 glad I stayed patient because if I hadn't been it would have ruined my father's trip. Patience is a good thing to have; you can gain it or lose it. In this case, I think I won something.
Once I was patient, one time we were @ CAPS4 the store and I was @ CAPS2 excited to go to the toys section. “@ CAPS1, we had to go to the grocery store first,” Mom said. I was really angry and mom said "be patient, the faster we do it, the faster we get to the toys". @ CAPS2 we have finished @ CAPS3 with the groceries and then we have to go to the clothes section. I was really, really angry. Mom said "the faster we do it, the faster we get to the toys." @ CAPS3, I had to try on clothes. I hate trying on clothes, I said. Then I was @ CAPS2 excited because we are going to toy selection, I was @ CAPS2 happy. I looked, one look then mom said "I could choose a toy." @ CAPS4 was @ CAPS2 hard to choose, I didn't know what to choose until I saw a cool truck. @ CAPS4 did a lot of testing @ CAPS4 had flames and @ CAPS4 was green. I asked and please please? A mom said "@ CAPS5 you can have it, I was @ CAPS2 happy. And that was a time when I was paticene.
I was patient to get my @ NUM1. It took forever to get it, had to be so patient to get the system. I took ten frames for my birthday, him and all the Taxlor gamestops to have him. I was in the car for hours to get one at the first stoppage we watched and they had one, it was in good condashi. I had three sets for it and that was the moment I was patient.
Once upon a time, in a country for the military, there was a girl named @ PERSON1. One day, @ PERSON1 and his mother were going to watch a movie called @ CAPS1 from @ LOCATION1. @ CAPS2 when they got to the theater the tickets sold out so they had to watch another movie. It must have been a bad day because once they got up the ticket sold out and don't forget to go ! @ PERSON1 and her mother left and went to eat. They went to a place called @ ORGANIZATION1 and ordered ! They ordered their food, sat down and ate. Once they were done they left and went to try again with the movie @ CAPS2 when they did the line, it was as long as a mile ! @ PERSON1's mom just told him to be patient and wait until I talk about it and listen to go ???. When they were there, they finally got the last available ticket. After that her mom @ CAPS5 "so darling @ CAPS3 was patient ??? When they got home ??? the couch, had a snack and waited for @ PERSON1's sister and dad to come home . well, they ??? with a big surprise and @ PERSON1's dad was holding tickets to see the movie @ PERSON1 and his mum just saw! "@ CAPS3 was trying to find you all day" @ CAPS5 her dad. “@ CAPS4 @ CAPS3 couldn't find you.” @ CAPS5 her sister. @ PERSON1 and her mom looked at each other and explained that they can go see the movie @ CAPS3 were patient and stood in line and have got the last tickets available ! " " And @ CAPS3 also won fifty dollars ! " exclaimed @ PERSON1. the @ CAPS6!
I'll talk about what I think is patience. I think patience is waiting. For example "you were very patient in line for cotton candy", says the clown. You know something like that, I know it's a short story, I'm sorry.
I remember one day I was waiting in the waiting room at the doctor's office with my mom because I wasn't feeling well. We sat there talking for about ten minutes when my mom said "@ CAPS1 it's been ten minutes already" "I wonder when I can go talk to my doctor." I said. “I don't know, but let's wait a little longer. Mom said. As we waited and patiently sat down, more and more children started to enter. I noticed that some were young and some were older. I signed. What is taking so long? I was walking. Was my doctor still here today? I looked at the wall and looked at its color. Orange. Before I know it, half an hour has passed. My mother was looking at her watch. "@ CAPS1 is almost @ NUM1 !" "@ CAPS2 !" I say pissed off and annoyed. " Are we going to sit here all day ?" " I asked. Finally, my question was answered when a nurse said that I could finally come back into a room and talk to my doctor about my illness. “@ CAPS3 for being patient! said the nurse, smiling. I smiled back. I have @ CAPS4 been patient.
One day my mom said I could buy this new toy at the store, but my mom had to do something else before going to the store, so I had to be patient. My mom had to go where she works because she forgot something. Then she had to go to the gas station. Then we finally went to the store and I got the toy I wanted.
Patience can be different in life. On the one hand, it can reward you in the end. For example, it may be more important if you are patient, as it would be a greater reward for you. Another thing is that it allows you to do other things in the process. For example, you can expect something, you can do something else when it's time you deserve it. Another thing is that it can be difficult, but you can control it if you are calm. For example, people can't wait, so they just want to rush in and be done. My last reason would be if you can do it once in your life, the second time can be easy. For example, the second would not be that difficult because you would be calm. It's patience in my way.
When I'm patient and @ CAPS1 good and not complaining and I like being pation and I @ CAPS1 well I don't fall and sometimes people are not them to calm down and sometimes when something takes forever i sometimes sit go and i'm still patent in school in restaurants and i'm still patent never i beat sometimes i can't be patent and i don't want people to thank i'm weird to eat something that I come from @ CAPS1 a neit that and I am patent in the lines to failure and at the fair sometimes have long lines and it's my goal is to be patent of everything but sometimes I am not patent because that sometimes something takes too long and I just like being patent.
In the write prompt, I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. I'm going to talk about the time I skipped school to go fishing with my dad and uncle @ PERSON1. I didn't sleep much, but I got up around the same time I went to school. I had to get out of the house before my brother saw me because he wasn't going with us. We got in the car and drove to my uncle @ PERSON1. When we got to his house, my dad started packing everything on the boat. Once we did that we hopped into my uncle's old rusty red truck @ PERSON1. Red paint was peeling all over the truck. We started driving and my uncle @ PERSON1 had to keep watching the boat. The boat was very small. It hardly suited all of us. It was only about a foot and a half wide and about @ NUM1 foot long. It scared me when we put the boat in the water and started driving. We crossed a beautiful river to the back of @ ORGANIZATION1. The @ ORGANIZATION1 was activated is called @ ORGANIZATION1. It's in @ LOCATION1. I was patient from the moment we arrived. I thought we were going to stay up, so I had my doubts about the fishing. Turns out we sat there while we were fishing. We fished for a good @ NUM2 hours that day. I was so patient while waiting for my float to come down so I could hook the hook. "@ CAPS1" said my uncle @ PERSON1. This means that the float goes underwater like a submarine does. We released @ NUM2 canes at once ! @ NUM4 pike rods and @ NUM1 bluegill rods ! I caught the biggest blue gill of the day that day! Today was one of the happiest days of my life !! This is about the time I had to be patient on @ ORGANIZATION1 for @ NUM2 straight hours.
One day I was at the store with my friends. I chose my slurpee and online to buy my slurpee. then an old lady stood in line. So to be nice I left her in front of me. @ CAPS1 a moment, she found out that she was missing a dollar. So I gave him a dollar. She turned to me, thanked me and gave me a mint @ CAPS1 I bought my slurpee, my friends and I had to cross the road. We sat for @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 minutes but it seemed like an hour. We crossed the road and walked to my house. On the way to my house, my friend is waiting to use the toilet. So we went to the market. We had to wait an hour for it to come back from the market. he told us he got lost. We walked home and that day I learned that it was difficult to be patient.
Two summers ago I helped with the children's camp at my church. I have been helping with the preschoolers for the week and it took a lot of patience. They were very excited and rough. They were still running around and screaming. I had to keep a calm voice and be patient with the children or it would make the situation worse. Later that week I was put in the care of a young child with special needs. He just couldn't sit still! I had to remind her over and over again not to be so strong. He was very determined to get what he wanted. It was difficult to stay calm. Despite the difficulties, I managed to be patient and calm. The little boy decided I was okay and started to behave. Now, every time he sees me in the hallway, he says to me: “ Hi ! " Very excited. Now, I'm glad I stayed patient.
One day I was in my house @ @ CAPS1 CAPS2 to celebrate my cousins @ CAPS3. He was @ NUM1 years old. So we played games played on the trampolenc. They walked in to relax and watch TV. We played with their dog after a while. Then a lot of people came. We went out for the third time played. We had to come in and @ CAPS4 for dinner. We all ate turkey, baked potatoes, cheesy potatoes, squeen, beans. It was pretty good. So they wanted us ??? project. It was a jon with a candle in it. We had to cover it with tissue paper and it uses a lot of glue. I had to wait patiently I was the last to dominate. So I walled up I waited ??? then finally I was able to do my project but I was ?? There is only one sitting at the table to do my project. In fact, it went pretty well after all. Being patient will get you a long way in life. You have to be patient in a job, restraunt and much more. So remember to be patient and you will be fine. Being patient will guide you through your life as a hole.
I'm going to write a story about a time when I was patient. When I was eleven, on @ DATE1, my mom was supposed to have her baby. I couldn't wait, I was so excited. We went to the doctor's office and moved to his room. (me and @ CAPS1 my mother's best friend) and @ CAPS2 her. When we entered the room, my mom was having contractions, she was screaming, screaming and shaking my dad's hand. I got scared as she screamed and didn't want her to hurt herself. I walked out of the room and me and @ CAPS1 went to get baby @ PERSON1 her first dress. The baby came home, she was still crying, that's when I learned to be patient while holding the babies.
Patience is essential when interacting with others. I learned this during a visit to the dentist. This @ DATE1, I had an appointment with the dentist, since it had been six months since my last. While I was waiting to be called, a boy entered with a severe toothache. Dentists decided to treat him first. I understand why they made this decision. I could tell the boy was in a lot of pain. Shortly after the boy went for treatment, an older woman walked in with a mysterious pain in her mouth. It turned out to be root canal treatment, and they decided to examine and treat her before I did. I also understood this decision. After the women go for treatment, a little girl walks in, bragging about her first loose tooth. Her mother said she wanted to pull out the little girl's tooth. When the dentist called her back before me, I was really frustrated. The girl was not in pain at all. In fact, she was quite happy to have a loose tooth. I had no idea it was fair that I had to wait another @ NUM1 minutes for her to get a tooth pulled. I had to be very patient because my appointment was postponed by more than two hours. I thought about how I felt when I lost my first tooth, then I didn't mind her walking past me. All in all, patience is a very important trait that people should show on a daily basis. I learned a very important lesson that day: patience should always be mandatory.
Once my friend started to wait while waiting for the teacher's wall, he was talking to a teacher. Afocer that he was talking with a teacher. Then she will get her question that she needs. It was a time when my friend who was patient.
Patients are about a lot of things. First, there are different ways of expressing patients. Second, people either have patients or don't. I admit that I am one of those people who do not have patients. My mom always says, “ @ CAPS1 your horses. » @ CAPS2 I know. I don't have any patients so why does she have to tell me I don't have any? I don't have any patients at the grocery store, I can't wait to go out but, everyone hates it, right ? Lines, lines, lines, I hate them forever, wherever you go. Plus, it's really nice to let someone out if they're in a real rush or in an emergency. Plus, the goodness in you can't help it when you have a little girl who needs to have you cut. So you see that patients can wreak havoc or some people have no problem with it. It just depends on who you are. Patients have a lot to do with complaints. But not like you think, when you are patient you don't complain at all, you relax and go with the flow of things around you. In particular, when you are in a difficult situation, it is better to have patient people with you rather than non-patient people. Well, it's about the patients and how people treat and relate and relax about it.
I remember the time I had my new puppy, we had to be patient. We had to be patient because he was not yet fully trained in paddy and he was mad. My dog is @ CAPS1 and they are known for herding cows. So every time we went outside he would bite our shoes. I don't know why this would try to move us, but it does. We had to be very patient when we trained him, it took him to @ NUM1½ years old to realize he wasn't supposed to. this but on (my dog) is always turning into new hobbies. We just have to be calm and patient and then we can train it. It takes @ CAPS2 dop a long time to brave its hobbies, so we have to be patient. This was the time when I was patient.
My mom woke me up early in the morning and told me I had to get up and get ready quickly. I asked what the problem was and she said we were going to the Potter Park Zoo. I @ CAPS5 don't know why just mabe a sudden idea. I got dressed and we hit the road. I was not feeling well that morning. We had breakfast on the metro. I didn't eat my sandwich when my stomach was hurting so much. It looked like @ NUM1 hours before we arrived. I was better now. We paid a card and watched all the awesome animals. I got to see @ NUM1 giant wolves, snakes, monkeys, lions, pekos, camels and @ CAPS1 other animals. It was so much fun! We have come to this bonding cage that you can go to, the birds just fly by losing! There was a little boy in there and a clip landed right on top of his head ! @ CAPS6 my mother's phone rang. He was my brother. He said at home because he didn't want to get up. I could hear my mother above the birds. She went out and stood outside, I followed her, she said "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, because I said you don't have to go @ CAPS5 anywhere." @ CAPS4 thing I know she was hanging up. We walked towards the fish building when his phone rang. "@ CAPS5 don't ever hang up on me again ! @ CAPS3, I @ CAPS5 don't need to fight with you ! It's gonna take a storm, I want you home! @ CAPS6 it's starting to rain and my mothers are always on the phone. I was getting very wet and on board I really wanted to see the fish. About @ NUM3 minutes later my mom hung up her phone. We're walking wet! My mom smiled at me and said "@ CAPS7 for being so patient !"
The time I was patient was when we had to make mcap pacifiers. I was one of the first to finish, so I had to sit quietly and read. I read most of my book. It took about an hour for everyone to complete. it was long to read. I got on board but sat down enough for people to finish, so I wouldn't be distracted. Thean at each end, we took a bathroom rack.
An operation ??? . It was when I was little. Patience was when my mom and cousin Cindy were talking. My cousin told me that when your mom and I were done talking she told me to wait your turn so I waited my turn . ?? I talk, I ask my mother if I can get my bike. I told my mom that I could ride a bike without working out. My mom came because I was going to pick up sargey. I was waiting for the sargey. The sargey was kind of ??? So I waited to say it was done. It was fun
I test my patience we expected a ???. you now if you have patience if you said for @ NUM1 you are both you will now if you have patience. I will be strong ??? ??? get unpatience at some point. You will never be quite patient in a car or newer. I was running, I had to be patient to see the ??? i had the patience i had the week to get some food so i could have the time to do it because i want pearls so i dont surd @ MONTH1 ??? This is how I got my rhythm.
There was a time when I was patient. The time I was patient is when my cousins @ PERSON1, @ and @ PERSON2 PERSON3 were playing Wii. And I said I play the winner @ CAPS1, my cousin @ PERSON2 won and @ PERSON1 didn't give me the controller and she wasn't sharing. @ CAPS1 then I said she could play one more time so it's my turn, instead she played four more times @ CAPS1 I said @ PERSON1 it's my turn that you play and I didn't, she said "it's not your turn". @ CAPS1 then her mother said "@ PERSON1 you can play @ NUM1 more minutes than it's @ CAPS2's turn an hour and a half ago and she still hasn't given it to me @ CAPS1 then I said @ PERSON1 it's my turn, and I have been patient for a long time you give it to me or I will take it, she still hasn't given it to me. I was getting ready and you still haven't shared @ CAPS1 and then she said I'm sick of it anyway. And this is the time that I have been patient.
Once, I was patient when I had to go to the doctor to get the sixth year vaccine. I didn't want to go but I had to go. I had no choice so I get in the car and we go to the doctor's office. Finally we arrived. My mom had to register and we sat down. Even though I waited three hours, I didn't complain. The doctors came out and I was scared but happy that it was finally my turn. Then he called out a different name as my mom and super mom kept waiting in the waiting room then my beloved mom said to @ CAPS6 wow @ CAPS1 you're not complaining now. I know it's because @ CAPS2 is getting more mature and I have a lot of patience. Thank you @ CAPS3, the doctor calls my name "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS5". @ CAPS6 and my mother go to the bedroom. The doctor says you grew up the last time you saw yourself. Doctor, is this going to hurt? No my dear, it is not. Are you sure. Positive, okay, ready, yeah. So I close my eyes and imagine something really cool. Doctor yes cute. When are you going to give this photo to @ CAPS6 ? I've already done it. Oh good? You look at your arm. Wow, I never felt a thing, see, I told you. Do you think you are the best doctor in the whole world that I have ??? thank you cute pie. You're welcome.
I remember the time my older sister over there was so patient on her birthday the "4th of @ DATE2" man, she was patient every time I asked her, can you what until your birthday, she said yes i can what until my birthday i can't what until my birthday because it's in "@ DATE1" until "fourth of @ DATE2" she was so happy that I just can't not believe she waited for her birthday she went to her friends house did her own shopping and fired the work was in the air my sister well that's how my sister was patient.
Ahhh ! I screamed in my head. Keeping my cousin took a lot more patience. (more her than me) @ CAPS1 started a @ DATE1 @ TIME1 my family went for a drink (I stayed to do my homework) Shortly after my mother left, I heard a knock on the door. My aunt walked in and whispered "you the most ??? @ CAPS1 okay, that's if I left @ CAPS2" @ CAPS3 I said "ok" @ CAPS4 was asleep for about half an hour. When I woke up @ CAPS4 was @ CAPS5 started to cry. The first thing I did was pick it up and carry it around. Always @ CAPS4 was crying! @ CAPS3 I thought her fabric needed changing. I changed its fabric and ??? Keep crying. Now I had to keep my patience because who would cry at a baby. Then I thought @ CAPS4 was hungry. I didn't know how to make a bottle when @ CAPS3 I had to read ??? (@ CAPS4 had no patience, all @ CAPS4 wanted was his bottle) @ CAPS5 when I was about to lose my patience I made a sure bottle bat if @ CAPS1 was good) but @ CAPS4 has been drinking @ CAPS1. Finally, I put her back to sleep (if @ CAPS4 was crying again. I would finally lose my patience) @ CAPS6 @ CAPS4 was sleeping @ CAPS4 looked peaceful until @ CAPS4 woke up. @ CAPS4 started crying again (this time I knew why because @ CAPS4 likes to be carried). By the time my aunt returned, my hands were sore. Although at the end of the day I understood that you need a lot of patience to take care of a baby, you need a lot more patience for a younger sibling, but trust me).
I will @ NUM1 write about a time when I was patient. My lawyer @ PERSON1 was soppese @ NUM1 bought me pens for a lot of @ DATE1 year as part of my money @ DATE1. Since then, I ask him every day. "@ PERSON2, @ CAPS1 @ MONEY1 still do your daily shopping" ? "no." "@ CAPS2." @ CAPS3 said "because I want my @ CAPS4 @ DATE1 pens present, remember @ NUM3 owes me". "@ CAPS5 I do but be patient" "@ CAPS6 ok my patients are about @ NUM1 are collapsing." I have been waiting since.
Have you ever stood in line to ride the biggest roller coaster in a Theatin Park? Have you ever waited until all your chores were done before you could play with your best friend? Have you ever had to wait for your little brother or sister to catch up? Well, in this story I am going to tell you about a time when I had to be patient. During @ DATE1 I had to go to the doctor to get @ CAPS2 injections that I could be safe. When I got to the doctor, I had to wait in a room for my name to be called. It was boring @ CAPS2 ! And I was like, "@ CAPS1 taking a few people a while to get @ CAPS2 photos that I can leave ?" @ CAPS2 I had to sit there for about half an hour until my name was called. Then, once in a back room, I had to wait even longer for my mom to sign the papers and so on, and also for the doctor to prepare the injections for what my mom told them to give me. But in the end, I came home and played with my friend. It was once among many that I had to be patient. And at least I got to play with my friend again. I hope you liked it.
I was patent when I waited for a chance to go to Cicago. I really wanted to go see the Windy City as my mom went to @ LOCATION1. I tried to forget about it until I went. It worked, but every now and then it came back to me. Although I remained patient and didn't bug my parents about it once. It took a few years, but I'm keeping my patience. Sometimes I even forgot that I had forgotten it. I just lived everyday like I didn't care about @ LOCATION1. No matter how tempting it was to see the @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2 Hawks game, I kept my cool. Then it happened @ MONTH1 @ DATE1, imagine it was @ NUM1 and I was still patient ! So to sum it up, no matter how long it would take, I would be patient.
I'll tell a story my way. It was @ DATE1. My sister was @ NUM1 years old. We were at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 preparing for his party. She had a pretty dress and my mom did her hair in the bathroom. I walked in and asked my mom if she could curl my hair. She said “ You have to wait ”. I made a snobby comment and I at one of the tables. I was patient. Well, if it was my turn. I sat there while she curled my hair. Later that day my sister, cousins @ NUM2 and I all had @ NUM3 @ CAPS2 to ourselves. I was last on the @ CAPS3 bowling list. I had to be patient for a while. It was finally my turn. I bowled and waited. Ball and water. Finally, it was cake time and I had to be patient again. Finally, I got my cake but I was tired of waiting for everything. While my sister was opening her presents, I was like "she is @ CAPS3 slow", @ CAPS3 I went and shouted "@ CAPS4 up!" I was yelled at and had to sit for a while. I should have been patient all day and maybe I would have been in every game. It's my story that I told in my own way.
Once I was patient was when I had to train my dog. " Sit my boy, " I order my puppy. My dog instead of sitting up jumps on me and takes the treat from my hands. I'll try to take the treat back from him and he swallows it. As @ CAPS1 walks to grab his collar and take him for a walk, he runs away. After chasing him for hours, he finally stops and looks at me while waiting to run again. "@ CAPS2 here, I'm done chasing you, let's just go for a walk, please," I said, slowly losing my patience. I start walking towards him again very slowly. I get close enough to grab his collar, but the dog runs away again, leaving just a pile of dust behind. "@ CAPS1 finished !" I scream and walk away angrily. I start to leave and go up the hill to my house. I go to my room ready to sleep. The next morning @ CAPS4 gets up and goes out to try and train a dog. I lost my patience yesterday and stormed off, but today @ CAPS1 is ready to work hard and keep my patience. "@ CAPS6 !" I scream while waiting for my dog to run @ CAPS2 and he does. With my first order, I tell the dog to sit down and he doesn't, so I don't give him the treat. I repeat and he sits down! Finally some progress after this wait. I give him the treat and he starts wagging his tail. To see if he understood I repeat it. He sat down again and received another treat. After this work with my dog I start asking him to do more things, sometimes he doesn't listen and sometimes he does. It was a time when I was patient with my dog teaching and training him and it definitely paid off.
One time I was patient was when we flew into the @ LOCATION2 to visit my sister at the school I requested. We flew to @ LOCATION4 and to @ ORGANIZATION1 but after that it was downhill. When we got to @ LOCATION3 we were stuck there for four hours ! after an hour I was bored with my little brother with us did not help at all. Then over the intereem we hear that we need to go through security now and sit in a room with a gift shop ??? all for @ NUM1 hours. When there was an hour left there was another announcement and it was that we were going to be delayed three more hours after that I was listening to my ipod and luckily I fell asleep for three and a half hours. When we finally get to leave, we walk to a six-seater phase to fly off to a small island nearby. When we got to @ LOCATION1, we rushed to the island school to see my sister. This was once where I felt patient waiting at an airport for @ NUM2 hours.
@ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 ”I hear the ticking of the clock, probably to annoy me. I can feel the tension in the small classroom. Everyone is waiting on the edge of their chair, why does @ CAPS4 seem so long? It's almost @ NUM1 minute now. The aroma of peperoni pizza is so strong I can practically taste @ CAPS4. It is agony. My stomach is growling, so hungry. @ NUM2 seconds can I wait that long @ NUM3 I'm not sure. The tension in the whole class is so great that I think my brain is going to explode. I can't take this the @ CAPS4 way too much. My eyes blink nervously every @ NUM4 seconds @ CAPS4 seems like an eternity, @ CAPS4 couldn't have been just a few seconds @ CAPS4? @ CAPS4 must be at least years old. @ NUM5 why is the time so short ? I am not very patient, not at all. But do I have a little patience? If I do, I don't see @ CAPS4 got. I'm about to jump out of my seat like I'm thrown from an @ DATE1. I try to stay still, but anxiety takes hold of me. If I had known that I would be so anxious for lunch that I would have had breakfast. Had come down to @ NUM6 seconds now. My excitement grew, but so did the tension. @ CAPS4 is enough to crush me now. I think I could do @ CAPS4 @ NUM7. My stomach is growling again, bush this time begging for food, @ CAPS5, demanding looks more like @ CAPS4. "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3", the clock shocks me, taunting me @ NUM8 seconds, I can't take this any longer. I think I'm about to crack. I don't handle patience well. @ CAPS4 is a time bomb in me, just waiting to go out at NUM9 seconds. @ CAPS4 seems like the bomb and the clock are counting down together. Both anticipating my snap. I'll show them. My will is stronger than my need. I can do it. I will prove that I have @ NUM10, "@ CAPS10!" finally, the bell rings to signal lunch time. I zoomed out like a squirrel that just sat on a snow cone.
Some people have a lot of patience. I am one of those people. I have had a lot of patience in my life. We were driving to @ CAPS1 from @ LOCATION1 and I was getting nervous. I knew it would be a busy day for my mom, so I decided to be patient and read on. Before I knew it, we were there. I was waiting to have a lemonade with my mom and we had been waiting here for @ NUM1 minutes already. I was getting tired of waiting in that long line for a little lemonade. But I knew my mom had already had a tiring day because my sister kept complaining. So instead of complaining, I stopped thinking about how long it would take to get our lemonade. I started to think about what it would be like to drive the @ CAPS2 and the next thing I knew we had our lemonade. I was starting to wish we hadn't lined up for the falcon @ CAPS3 because it was so long. I was really angry because it was taking so long to wait for a @ NUM2 second ride. But then I remembered my mom was with me and she was having a bad head. So I shut my mouth. I was glad I was patient that day. Because if I hadn't been there, my mom probably wouldn't have been as happy as she was at the end of the day.
One time I was patient was when we went to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1. We had to stand in line for half an hour. We were supposed to go around the corkscrew. I was very excited to take this tour. So I decided to be patient. So for @ NUM1 min, once I got to the front line, I couldn't wait. So I hurried and then went upstairs. I really didn't like that day when I had to stand for so long. But, that's what patience means.
On @ CAPS1 as I was fishing for salmon in the little crossing bay there was a hep tromendus on the trolling line I launched from where I was sitting like a rocket I lifted on the line that I expected. I thought it was a false alarm (hitch) trust me I was thinking wrong. the pull did a dance and then bent again very quickly. "@ CAPS2 on," I shouted at my cosin, he ran to my rescue. We @ CAPS4 looked at the water, the sounding still flexed didn't budge, I was looking for the grass to tumble because I felt like I was in an old western movie booth. Finale I looked at my cousin and I said, " I was patient, do you think I should put it on stage " ? " @ CAPS3 take the net first from me ", he fumed and grabbed it then said" When you're ready "from nowhere where the steel cable that was my line shot like a bullet, but the cyrick kick from him and then the line loosened. My cosin and I @ CAPS4 knew what had happened. the @ CAPS2 that I thought was going to be mine was now swimming in deeper water to piss off more men fishermen with his patient manners.
My mother has been very patient with me on several occasions. I tend to tell my mom stories about my day at school when I get home. One time, as we were sitting there in the living room, I was telling the story to my mother. As I continue my mother has the patience to listen to him. Although the @ MONTH1 story was boring for her and extremely long, she listened, commented and never showed the sign of boredom. The expression on her face made me happy to know that she was listening.
I once was patient when I let a stranger cut in front of me for food. And when my brother and I had to use the bathroom, I let him go first even though I was the first in the line.
Patience is a very difficult thing to capture. In my opinion, patience is a gift to be had. I once had to try and @ CAPS1 my patience was before a football game @ ORGANIZATION1. Part of it led there. It was @ NUM1 and people were migrating to @ PERSON1 ! It took us @ NUM2 to go @ NUM3 ! I was about to run to the game ! I couldn't wait any longer to go to this game ! »@ CAPS1 your patience ! My father reminded me over and over. Once we finally got there out of traffic I had to wait for another @ NUM4 before the game ! How could I have waited so long? Could it be possible? I'm just sitting there in a lounge chair watching the people go by our tailgate on game day at college. I just wanted to scream I wanted to leave and go to the stadium: too bad! Finally, we took off from the tailgate. It was fun walking with all the @ LOCATION1 state fans and tailgaters. Now I was sitting in this boring line, trying to be patient. Again I had to question myself, I could be patient enough, one by one people came in. I got closer and closer, actually using my patience. When it was finally my turn, I rushed so excited to finally be in the stadium and conquer my patience all day long. It was great to finally be in there, to get over my rushed feeling and let patience wash over me.
I was very patient once when my grandmother was in the store. I was trying to build the whole store and I really had to go to the bathroom. I started to become real; crazy because I thought the person at the store calling the stuff was trying to go slow so I couldn't use it. The only reason I didn't complain was that most of the stuff and the basket was mine. It was a time when I was very patient
Every year we have a family reunion for two weeks. Cousins, aunts, uncles come from all over the country to enjoy these few weeks together. We go to the small town of @ PERSON1 right next to the famous @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. The only problem is it's a four hour drive, and if you know me, I'm not that patient. My brother and I always rotate every year to see who is riding with my mom. We flip a coin and I always lose. If you ask me, she's the most impatient! But once you're there, everyone's happy to see @ NUM1 waiting for @ DATE1 to kickstart our patience. And it's my story to be patient.
Once I had to be very nice. I had to wait five hours before my grandmother arrived at my house. Every hour I would go look outside to see if she was there. Eventually she did and I was very happy. Some examples of patients who remain patient are… @ NUM1. Focus on something else @ NUM2. @ NUM3 also someone's house for a while. @ NUM4. Or even taking a nap @ CAPS1 are examples of patience.
My grandmother is almost always patient with me, especially when she teaches something like cooking or sewing. My grandmother once taught me how to use a sewing machine. She taught me to change the color of the thread, and she helped me untangle the thread, although it took a while and I'm not the best listener, it took a lot of patience. Another time, she taught me how to icing sugar cookies. I would be very relied on because either the cookie broke or my icing was lumpy and all over the cookie even the bottom, but Grandma put up with my complaints and when I finally frosted it didn't. not broken and the frosting was smooth, she praised me, even though I had probably broken half the sugar cookies. My grandmother was also patient with me when I helped her make carmol corn, which has a lot of difficult stages, and if you mess up the whole lot is ruined. She let me do the easy things mostly, but she also let me do the gravy on the last batch, which was fun, and when I started to slow down, instead of yelling at me to hurry up, she politely asked me to go a little faster which must have taken a lot of patience. My grandma also taught me how to cook which took a lot of patience from @ CAPS1 as I was constantly spilling flour, vanilla, baking soda, whatever could be dropped in the recipe, i dropped it i never wanted to clean it either and when i did i left half the stuff on the floor again. My grandmother is always patient with me no matter what I do.
One time I was patient was when I went on the cedar point raptor. There was a two hour queue and my friend and I were bored. There was music but it didn't really amuse us. But I had never been on the raptor before and I was really excited to go. One hour dragged. Then finally, ten more minutes until I could get on the raptor, it was the best ride ever.
When they didn't know when to go in and how to protect their food. Our time is much easier than before, they had to work hard for everything given to us. Our two periods are very different. There aren't many days that I'm patient, but that day was one of them. I was playing a soccer game on a beautiful sunny day @ DATE1 @ TIME1. I was starting the quarterback and I scored @ NUM1 touchdowns and landed a touchdown just in the first half. At this point we were up @ NUM2 and the coaches took out all the starters for the entire second half. I expected to keep playing but no they told me to sit on the bench for the rest of the game. It was very hard for me because I had to wait until the end of the match to get up from the bench. I'm not a very patient person so it was @ CAPS1 difficult for me. I hope I never have to do this again.
I was patient before; I had been hunting with my dad before, @ DATE1. I was blind with him for a long time, waiting for the deer to come home. He said they would come home at night, or late afternoon. We waited forever, when they finally came in, me and I didn't. Other guys shot one they all ran. We waited maybe ten more minutes and then we walked in, we were all there from @ TIME1 to @ NUM1. I have been patient the whole time.
One day my parents and I went fishing. Our fish below was going like crazy, but I know the fish were bilious. @ CAPS5 figured out (in no time I might add) where our dog would back off like crazy wherever we started to be real in our lines, even if there was nothing on them. We waited and waited and waited, but still nothing came. Every now and then we had to move again because of the current. After sitting there the whole house . I felt something on my line. At first I thought I was hanging on a rock, @ CAPS1 I started to roll up, the line came up a bit, @ CAPS1 I went up a bit more, I thought @ CAPS5 felt like a fish pulling on my line, @ CAPS1 I called, “@ CAPS3, daddy, I think I don't have a fish!”. @ CAPS1 my dad told me to do @ CAPS4. Eventually I felt like my arms were going to drop, but the fish appeared! As dad grabbed the net and pulled the fish out of the water, I asked, " The kind @ CAPS4 is @ CAPS5 ?" He said: "@ CAPS5 is a walleye." I didn't know @ CAPS4 to say. My first walleye! And dad even said @ CAPS5 is big enough for @ CAPS6 ! @ CAPS1, then we came home, filleted the fish and ate some walleye for dinner.
It was such a boring @ DATE1 @ TIME1 at school than usual and my @ CAPS1 came with crutches. I panicked and ran to her and she told me that she broke her leg and was not allowed to go out for the entire month. It was hard to wait a whole month to spend time with her, but her safety was more important than my fun. It was @ NUM1 weeks after my friend broke her leg, I was doing well not to disturb him so I was proud of myself, but I was able to help her in school. It was a few weeks later, she was almost better, so I was excited and went to buy her a present. The next @ DATE1 @ PERSON1 was out of the cracks and, thrown back and forth on its feet, it's the story of when I was patient.
I'm the kind of person you would call inpate but i will try to explain it in the best way possible the only time i'm patient is when something existing on tv happens my friends always pay for everything @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and stuff but i never paid myself
@ PERSON2, get down here, I need you to open an envelope ! My mom said. We came down the stairs because an envelope can only mean a ballot, a letter, a @ CAPS1 card or the balance of a checking account. We went downstairs and saw that they had brought out a camera and the envelope had a star on the back that said @ NUM1 radio. We open @ CAPS6 and @ CAPS6 says congroduclotions that you won tickets for @ NUM2 first @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 with @ PERSON1 ! I was just looking at them in wonder, my sister was panicking! Then my mother told me that my aunt is accompanying us! The surprise kept coming and going. Another huge surprise was the lines on girls @ NUM3 lined up in front of the oak music doors @ CAPS4 @ PERSON3. Then the security started to move and dispatch all the girls, we were pushed about a quarter of a mile from where we were. @ NUM4 ½ hours later we were waiting, then I see this boy's head pop out of a music window @ PERSON3 and say, "@ CAPS5 girls !. After saying that about @ NUM5 the girls are got mad screaming. @ NUM6 ½ hours later of that they started letting people in. The theater was cozy and warm to be out in the cold for @ NUM7 hours @ CAPS6 felt good. Iyaz was the guest special to warm us up for @ PERSON1. When he came out every girl was screaming at the top of their lungs ! He sang the concert and @ CAPS6 was a great experience for my very first concert ! "
One day during @ DATE1 my phone rang. Few people call my cell. I rushed to my room, but my phone was not in sight! Ah where is it? I swear, I was about to completely demolish everything. I stopped, I felt my back pocket and it was there. I felt like an idiot. I was panicking with my phone because I couldn't find it. When it turned out to be in my back pocket. Either way, it still sounded. I looked at the contact. I was amazed to see who it was. It was my friend @ CAPS1! I answered the phone and @ CAPS1 starts talking. She wanted to know if we could spend a slumber party in her backyard. I was so excited, but the same day my family and I were going to a fair. When I asked my dad and he hesitated to say yes. I packed my bags, hoped in the car, and ready to go. I really didn't want to go to this fishing fair. I just wanted to hang out with @ CAPS1. Here we are at the fair. I got out of the car. My brother and I just walked away. We did a few rides, played a few games. All I thought about was how much fun I was going to have @ CAPS4. I waited and waited and waited. Finally! Yes we can go. AT @ CAPS4. I couldn't wait any longer. I was so excited: @ CAPS6 I'm at @ CAPS4. It's time. I had no choice but to wait. In conclusion, this was one of the times I was patient.
Tap, tap, tap. My fingertips bounced off the armrest with every movement. I had asked my @ CAPS1 to hurry @ CAPS2 I wouldn't be late. I had told him like I had done a million times before: "@ CAPS1, you know how much being on time for training means to me." @ CAPS2 I sat there, slumped on the couch, my backpack strapped securely over my shoulders. This happens @ CAPS7 the time I thought my @ CAPS1 would have already learned. In the meantime, I turned on the television to occupy myself. Unfortunately, with each flip, I got more and more thoughtless. “@ CAPS3 is she ? Why is it taking @ CAPS2 so long ? ” @ CAPS4 as these swirled around in my head. Then my @ CAPS1 stumbled into the family room. She ripped her keys and we went. rushed into the car. As I clicked on my seat belt, I flipped the switch to open the garage. As I sat in my seat squirming, the garage door creaked open . My @ CAPS1 cranked the engine and we cascaded down the driveway and down the road. Just to make my luck even better, we got caught in the traffic. As the cars rolled by, time passed . The clock was showing @ NUM1, I knew for sure I wasn't going to make it on time. I threw myself back into the seat. I closed my @ NUM2 and took deep breaths. Take a lot of breaths. deeps helped me slow my heart rate, which allowed me to lower my level of st res. "@ CAPS5 passive." I said to myself. “@ CAPS5 passive. Relax, you will get there. @ CAPS7 suddenly my @ CAPS1 slammed on the brakes. My eyes opened to see that we had arrived at the pool. The time read @ NUM3. I was going to get there! I exploded out of the car with my backpack on my back. At that point, I was like 'you see, you can do this. You managed to practice swimming, and @ CAPS7 you had to slow down and @ CAPS5 passive. Good work"
I was patient when it was my birthday and got nothing. I thought I would have at least one thing but I got nothing. I haven't done anything wrong, but I still have nothing. The next day I did not receive anything, I did not ask for anything, but I still did not receive anything. The next day, I received nothing. But that night while skating at skate port @ NUM1 got nothing. Like @ TIME1, I saw my cousin and she gave me @ MONEY1 for my birthday. I thought everyone forgot but I was wrong. I was so happy too. I had to be patient to get something and not have to ask for something.
The @ CAPS1 in @ DATE1. One day my aunt @ PERSON1 was looking at me and all of a sudden all the lights went out. So I thought we blew a fuse so my aunt @ PERSON1 and she went to fix it and it didn't work so she ??? calling my mom and her connection got lost so we got our generator and looked at the news and my mom got stuck on the freeway ??? I was worried so we finally got our phones working and some of our family came over and we were so angry because nothing worked for a week and we had to be very patient.
I've been waiting for about two hours. When will I get my food. I was hungry so I told my mom she asked me if I wanted to take my cat out, I said sure and put on my jacket. Mum said I had to go get dad, wait in the car so I went and waited for them for a minute. When they finally got out, daddy asked ????????? Shouted @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. He said ok and we went. when we got there there were no other stores open. When we walked inside there were about a billion people. I was so hungry I could eat a pig. Metarorickly speaking. We went to the chicken coop and asked how long we had to wait. And the guy at the counter said about two o'clock. After about @ NUM1. I started reading a magazine and some people left but the people in front of us went to these seats. We were next door to sit down but it took about an hour. Before some people leave. I didn't complain at all and I never spoke at all, and I speak a lot. And that's when I was very patient.
Once I was patient, I went to the doctor's office. Yesterday I went to the doctor's office and the waiting room was so full we had to get up. Because there were so many people waiting, we had to wait with them. We were number @ NUM1, and it took us @ NUM2 hours just to sit down ! It took a lot of patience because the waiting time + the waiting time of a doctor about @ NUM3 hours. When I finally walked in I felt relieved by @ NUM4 ! I felt like I had an elephant lifted off my shoulders. Even though it took a while it was worth it now I'm feeling better and I'm back to school!
Patience is sometimes difficult to do if you are already experienced. But sometimes you act like one of your family is talking and you are waiting for something else which is patience.
I asked my mom if I could have a phone but she said no not yet. She said I couldn't get one until grade @ NUM1 unless I write a phone @ CAPS1 now and can't until grade nine to get a real phone. I told him okay. But when are you going to get it for me. She said you have to be patient. I told her I would but when she said ASAP like the @ DATE1. I said I will be patient until then and won't bother you about it. It was a time when I had to be patient.
My dad and I were in a store once. There was a line about @ NUM1 people that my dad and I were starting to get impatient with, so I told myself to calm down and wait. But I still didn't calm down, then the very first person left, then started to calm down and wait for the next person to leave.
My fingers were frozen as I sat down and wanted to. The seconds lingered in minutes, turned into hours. My body heat was escaping quickly like sand in the winds. I struggled in the mud as the slippery rain pounded my skin. I should have waited. I was patient as they explained. But I didn't listen. I should have waited. I should have waited, I should have waited. The words got mixed up. My bones are cold, I was only about @ NUM1 yards from home. My legs refused to walk because they were shaking violently. Wait, be patient, I reminded myself. A cop car in my parents' driveway. I pushed my left leg through the mess of leaves and mud, patience wasn't a factor at the moment. Nine meters, eight, seven, six. I stopped, I put my powder over my head but the wind paid off again, five, four, three, two, one. I was at my doorstep. I weakly raised my hand to knock. The @ CAPS1. Quick steps, the door opens. I am overwhelmed with HugG. “ You should have waited ! My father cried, tears streaming down his face. I smile weakly.
There was a person named @ PERSON1. He wanted a video game for his @ CAPS1- box @ NUM1. But her father has just been made redundant and her mother had a poorly paid job. Since they had very little money, he could not buy the game. A few months later, his father finally found a job with @ CAPS2. But @ PERSON1 still didn't have enough money for the game. A few more months went by, @ PERSON1 finally had enough for the game. His mother took him to the store to buy it. He was very excited. He ended up really liking the game.
Have you ever heard your mom or dad say that patience is a virtue? Well I've heard it many times in my house too many times. Patience is something which means you have to wait like when you want to go see a new movie on opening night you might have to wait in a big line because it's a new movie. So you will have to wait patiently!
Once I was patient it was during @ DATE1. My @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1 was kind enough to invite me to @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 with his family and my pacents said yes. It was an hour @ NUM1 @ CAPS4 I think @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, @ CAPS7 it was fun because we brought a lot of stuff to keep us busy, we watched a movie on my @ ORGANIZATION1, listened to some music I had no trouble waiting until we got there. When we got to the hotel we picked the bad guys and then hopped in the car to go to @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, this is @ NUM2 awesome. The first ones went on the @ CAPS10 I had tears in my eyes it was so scary then the music was so fast it felt like we were going to fly off the runways. Then we wanted to go on malliniom @ CAPS7 force, the line was one hour long and we were in the middle of it. So it would be useless to try to escape the queue, then finally it was on the way back, @ CAPS7 it didn't work so we had to wait, it wouldn't copper so he said to use that we can get free passes to continue any ride, and ahead of everyone @ CAPS7 we were only able to do this once. As you see us waiting, we were Rwandan, I think it was really worth it!
Where was a time when I was patient dad to get my first silly hamster. And patient is that you are understanding and tolerant. I am very patient and happy to have my first hamster. And I had my first ??? hamster. And I had two. And they're dumb and they bite. And my brother had the patience to have his ???. And the patience is that you relzed wanting to see you badly and on the go to get the thing you want.
I was patient when I waited for a guy to invite me out: :) and I'm still dating him today. His name is @ PERSON1 and yes he is going to my school when he asked me to go out, I didn't know what to say because he took too long and I still didn't like any guy other than him. When somebody's patient who doesn't rush, he's waiting for something or someone like me. When I was patient I didn't ask him @ NUM1 times, I waited for him to ask me out because if someone doesn't like it they might refuse you and hurt you. Okay, if you don't want to take my advice, hurt yourself.
I chose to write a story about a time when I was patient. It was my first time hunting, I only hunted squirrels but still. What I had to do was walk in the woods and sit down once I sit down, you can't move. So I was sitting very still for @ NUM1 minutes and finally saw a squirrel. So I took my shotgun and shot him in the chest. I was patient so I had a little squeak. So this is my story about the patients.
I was at the @ NUM1 fair with my friends. There was a merry-go-round called the freak-out that we really wanted to go on. The queue was too long so we decided to do more rides. We looked at the line and all it did was lay down. We still decided to go in line. It felt like we were stepping forward an inch every @ NUM2 minutes, I had to be very patient. Inside i was ready to go crazy but i was calm outside it was the longest @ NUM3 minutes ever !!!!
@ PERSON1 and his dad were planning to go fishing this @ DATE1 @ TIME1. They have everything they need, fishing pots. Fishing box, fishing nets, bait and lunch. They drove to the lake, got into their little rowboat, and left. The father of @ PERSON1 was the first to catch something. He caught a ten inch smallmouth bass. He was too small, so he threw him back and continued to fish. The lake was calm today. There was a gentle breeze in the air from @ DATE2. The sun was up but it was still a bit cold. Sitting him there quietly, patiently. @ PERSON1's dad had another pull on his line. He quickly pulled it up. This time he caught a twenty inch pike. Another too small so he threw it back. '' Fishes really bite today, huh? '' His father told him. But the truth was they had been there for an hour and @ PERSON1 hadn't taken a bite. They fished for about an hour before taking a lunch break. They just brought sandwiches and fries and some waters. When they had finished eating, they returned to fishing. @ PERSON1 threw his line as far as he could get it. He sat down and waited about twenty minutes when he finally got a tug on his line. ''I have one. I have one, '' he told his dad, trying to reel in his line as fast as possible. When he put it in the boat, they measured it. @ PERSON1 caught a fourteen inch largemouth bass. "@ CAPS1 like you grabbed tonight's dinner." Said his father. They stayed outside for about twenty more minutes, then came in with a fish dinner. @ PERSON1's patients caught him a good fish.
When I was patient I was in a store to buy something and the queue was long so I had to wait to pay for my things that I was buying. I waited and the person in front of me had a big cart of food and everything, so I had to be patient when he was up after I had to wait for all the people to finish paying for their food and everything.
As I got older, my tolerance for patience increased. I was six years old and I was ahead when my mother told me to wait to receive my presents for Christmas. After she said I was mad at her and stomped on my room. I collapsed hard on my bed and finally fell asleep. My mom came to my room and told me that I was allowed to open my gifts, but before she did she told me I had to be patient. Now since I'm older I know the fairer attitudes so when Christmas rolls around I don't care what presents I remember when she told me to be patient to receive because you might not be in. able to get whatever you want and when your patient and listen to what your mother tells you to do so she can explain that maybe I am not getting much or what I want. So now my patience is great for most things but since then I don't want to rush and miss the details of what people have to say or I might be disappointed. Patience is one thing where if you don't have it then things won't get figured out sometimes and things couldn't turn out the way you wanted them to too. Enthusiasm is different from patience. Patience means when you wait and don't want to. Enthusiasm is when you are out. People are confused, so when a kid is excited, look for details and don't say be patient, say calm down because they might take it badly if you don't tell them why. In conclusion, these are ways that I have been taught to act, so please take my words into consideration, they might help you.
Once before going to point @ CAPS1 with my friend @ PERSON1. I have been patient along the way. I stood in line to enter. I was patient in the queue to get on the dragster. I was patient to do all the rides. I once had to go to the hospital to have an echo in my heart. I was patient while waiting for my results. I am always patient. Well, most of the time. Once I went to @ LOCATION1 I was patient going through security. I was patient on the plane while waiting to get there. I was patient to come down. I was patient with my luggage. I must go to school. I am patient while waiting for lunch. I am patient for school to be over. I am patient to wait until the end of the course. Like I said, I am mostly patient.
Best ride to @ ORGANIZATION1 lasted over @ NUM1 hours of waiting. Bad news for me, I'm definitely not a patient person. Like this time, I was standing in line for an ice cream. There were only two people in line but I didn't want to wait so I didn't want any more. That's how impatient I was, but riding the best race in the world I was prepared to wait. Two hours of waiting in line, we saw a sign that said one hour from this @ ORGANIZATION1. Very crazy I kept telling myself this was the best ride you could wait an hour longer so I did. When we got on the ride it was fun but the ride only lasted NUM2 seconds longer
@ CAPS1 cold @ CAPS1 raining, I'm wet @ CAPS1 has been @ NUM1 hour and still no activity. I just have to wait. I hunt deer by hitting with my new @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 bow. I'm a good shooter but not that good. I know patients are the key to deer hunting, so I'll have to wait. I now see a deer about @ NUM2 yards and shoot @ CAPS1 so my patience pays off
Now, this story was sequenced about ten minutes ago. When I had to keep enormous patience. As you can see there are several erase marks in the background of my text. I accidentally wrote the second part of this test on this page ! I'm so glad I had such a caring teacher who found this for me or I would have failed! When I was quietly sitting at my desk, she (the teacher) approached me and held the test in front of my face. I knew it meant something bad. When she said I did it on the wrong page. I almost tipped over but held it back. I think patience is a great quality to have in order for you to get it right. I am very happy to have a good dose of patience.
The time I waited for the party to take place. It was @ DATE2 until I got invited to a party in zapzone. He told me the party was @ DATE1. @ NUM1 weeks he told me this, and still didn't have the party he said I had agreed to pay for myself. But it was a party so I didn't @ NUM2 weeks later I went shopping at school for ten minutes. I came back, he said he had already had a party. He wasn't there because a party lasts an hour or two so I gave up.
Everyone loves @ CAPS1, and they all need to be patient for it. Especially on the @ TIME1 of @ CAPS1 @ CAPS3. Everyone in my family is always very excited and looking forward to the morning, especially me. I am so excited that I can hardly sleep. In fact, last year must have been the most difficult. It was @ NUM1 in the morning @ CAPS1 and I woke up for no reason. I decided to go back to sleep and only did so for about 30 minutes when I woke up again. I couldn't fall asleep! I went downstairs with a few blankets and tried to fall asleep when I saw the huge amount of stuff right there. I sat down and looked around them. I was so excited but I remembered that I would have to wait for everyone to wake up. So I tried to go back to sleep. I closed my eyes and slept for about four minutes at a time and finally gave up trying. It was @ NUM2 am. I turned on the @ CAPS5, threw a movie, and waited. At @ NUM3 am most of my brothers were up and I couldn't take it anymore. I broke down and started to complain. I had become very impatient. I was finally told yes and started to open my presents. I was finally happy.
One time I was patient was when I was @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 at @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION2, we were lining up for this water roller coaster and the line was really long and they had this line called easy pass where you wait an hour then go to this machine to get eazy ticket but we decided to wait in the very long queue. called slaps. So we played for a little while and we were about halfway there and started to regret that we stayed in the huge queue as it had been an hour already and we are only heading towards the walked halfway. About ten minutes later I stopped playing slaps with my dad because my hands were red and his hands were barely red even though it was. So we just waited and waited until we were there three quarters of the way there. raft. We walked through a cave then stopped about 40 feet away and then plunged into a huge amount of water. Turns out the wait was worth it. So this is a time where I showed patients.
Once I was patient it was when we were flying to @ LOCATION1. We were at @ LOCATION2 on hold. God, I thought how long this might take. But even the plane came. I once thought this was the last plane we were to take today. But then the pilot said it would be a flight @ NUM1 @ NUM2. Then I looked around to see what I had to do. I had my I-pod, a book and the @ CAPS1 in front of me. Once we were up in the air I thought I was going to take a nap. But it only killed an hour so I decided to watch a movie. I looked @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. It took another two hours. At this point, I was starting to get bored. I decided to read. But after an hour and a half, I finished the book. Then my I-pod came out. I listened to music until lunch arrived an hour later. After having lunch which took @ NUM3 minutes, I decided to watch another movie. I watched @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 which killed enough @ NUM4 hours. Then, with only @ NUM4 hours left, I wanted to watch the @ NUM6 season from the office. Then when there were only @ NUM7 minutes left when they cut everything, I watched us land at @ LOCATION1. It was long but I was patient and held on.
When I have patience, it's when I go out to eat. So no one can spit my food in it. Like once, I went out to eat with my family. And we were all dressed the same for my birthday. So I ask my daddy to tell them my birthday is today. And I wanted a piece of cake now. So he means what I said and they ??? give us a minute. So I waited and waited. And finally said bring me a piece of cake now or I'll have that brown place down. Then my dad said bring her a piece because she can make it happen. So they finally bring me my cake. And they sang me happy birthday. And I was happy after that I found out that they spat on my food and ate it. I found out because before I got up I heard people talking about how they spit on my food. Then I said do you wait in the fries, they said yes. Then I said o I don't care because I haven't eaten the fries. They said why me because I the fries is nice. And I rolled my eyes and left. But I 'm not doing this because I was afraid someone would do it again. This is why I have patience.
@ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 was a patient ??, @ CAPS2 decided to order them pizza ???. The delivery man tells @ CAPS2 that he will be home in fifteen minutes. @ CAPS2 was still waiting for his pizzas after fifteen minutes. And how late is the delivery man with them ??? after being late. @ CAPS2 said he didn't care.
We climbed into the rental car saying our farewells as we made our way back to the airport. " Can't believe the airport had an opening earlier today and called us ?" Exclaimed my @ CAPS4. "@ CAPS1 Can't either. I mean out of it all- Were here ! The man who was quick. As we walked back to the airport smelling that rhinestone foam smell, we checked our bags. “@ CAPS2 to @ LOCATION1 @ NUM1, @ CAPS3.” @ CAPS4 explained to the clerk “@ CAPS5 sorry by that your @ CAPS10 is full,” she told us through a hesitant smile. ”@ CAPS6 you called saying there were empty seats and you invited us to swap @ CAPS2. " " @ CAPS5 sorry @ CAPS6, it wouldn't be fair if we gave @ CAPS2 which is rightfully ours. " @ CAPS8 yet another smile of failure "@ CAPS6 you can get your original @ CAPS2 if you want", @ NUM2 @ LOCATION2. @ NUM2 ! What am I going to do for seven hours! D ' First my brother and I had races up and down the escelators. Then we took the shuttle all over. By @ NUM4 I knew the inside place. Soon it time to leave sou damn the speaker came on @ CAPS10 @ NUM5 to @ LOCATION2 was deylayed an hour and a half ”@ NUM6 really? Luckly my @ CAPS4 took me to an ecstatic restraunt. Belle restraunt soon it was time to go. Please don't get delayed again ?! This was not the case. I felt happy that we finally left @ CAPS8 sad. I learned a great lesson in patience! It is not difficult @ CAPS6 not impossible.
There are some ?? ??? in ??? ??? you ??? ??? per second and one of those things is patience. Patience is when you understand things and tolerate them and when you experience things which are not ??? complain that when patience is. You must have patience if you plan to have kids or be me cather or any other job you have to wait in ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ???? ???? ??? ??? ???. These are just a few reasons why ??? Patience. The last reason I'm going to say you need patience is because not everything is fair in life ??? for you. You have to work for this and for that you have to have patience. So no matter if you don't have patience, you will really have a hard time getting through life. So these are all the reasons why I think you need to have patience.So if you don't have patience, learn to be patient.I believe you can do it, all you have to do is try to be more understanding and not to complain ??? it's hard in life, there are going to be a lot of difficult things in life. There is only one more thing I have to say and that is just give it a try.
One day, I had to put up with my big brother all day. He went to get a cell phone I wanted one, but I was in too much of a hurry to get one. So when he found out I couldn't get one, he harassed me. I wanted to take this phone and smash it, but I didn't because I played it cool, so when he got home I walked away from all the nagging. I went to do something else, but he kept following me, so I found a big thug that he couldn't get up and who stayed there until he left. After that, I went to enter it. But I was locked out, thought I had a plane? thanks for listening
The time I was patient was when I was about seven and me, mum, dad, sister, trouble and grandma from the north (where my grandma was) until West Virginia and back most of the time I slept or woke up to nap ate while playing at a hotel pool. Sleep then hit the road the next day. the thing I had to be so patient with was we were going to have @ CAPS1 there, so I wanted to open my presents. and one time we got stuck which slowed us down for about an hour. So when we @ CAPS2 got there I jumped running it's quick I could open the door and surprise marrying the guys from @ CAPS3.
I once played video games. I was waiting around the corner for a guy to walk around. I waited for about @ NUM1 minutes. So there he is. I was waiting to kill that he passes in front of the assassination of the boom, it was the moment. I had patients
My friend once told me to read this book, so I borrowed her. The name of the book is called "The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2". It's also a TV show on @ ORGANIZATION1. I was reading the books and one of the main characters named @ PERSON2, brother of @ PERSON1 are vampires. They turned into @ CAPS1 because of a girl named @ PERSON3. @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 died because they were trying to save @ PERSON3, at least that's what everyone thought. @ PERSON3 gave them enough blood not to die, they would become a @ CAPS1. They thought @ PERSON3 was on time because that's where everyone was taking vampires because the town found out there were vampires there. @ PERSON2 came back after @ NUM1 years looking for something to help @ PERSON3 relax, I think that is patience. Wait @ NUM1 years trying to find something to help get your true love out of this mess. He waited a long time. I believe that patience waits a long time to do something and you don't complain while doing it.
I remember when I wanted to ride off-road motorcycles and my dad was busy and waited until he had time to put gas in it. When @ PERSON1 wanted to ask a question he had, but had to wait and then asked the question
When I was @ NUM1 my mom and sister worked and cleaned the house and I kept asking my @ CAPS3 " can we go get some pizza ?" " @ CAPS1 every time I asked her she would reply" if you help us and we finish before dinner we can go get a pizza ". I didn't want to wash the windows, clean my room, or wash the car. So I waited on the playground in the back yard swinging and going down the slide, @ CAPS1 after @ NUM2 minutes it got boring. After that, that's when I knew I had to be patient. I rolled down the hill to the river and waded through its cold water. @ CAPS1 I was always bored. I got out of the river and ran to @ CAPS3. " @ CAPS2 are you and @ PERSON1 finished yet ? " I asked. “We're done with the @ CAPS1 house, the car hasn't been washed yet,” she replied. I walk to my bike and have my helmet sitting on my bike saddle. The wind in my face was nothing compared to eating pizza, @ CAPS1 going up and down the aisle somehow was more entertaining than cleaning. I jumped off my bike and ran into the house, taking two left immediately after entering the house. My family always dines at @ NUM1: 35 because my dad comes home from work at @ TIME1 and cooks dinner. I rush to see if my @ CAPS3 and my sister are already done : " Are you done ?" " I asked roughly. " You can help if you want faster " replies @ CAPS3. "@ CAPS4, alright, I'll help you," I grab the hose and spray the dirt and bird poo on the windows. After @ NUM5 minutes of cleaning we were done, @ CAPS3 left dad a note and she said, "Let's go !" @ CAPS5 all day long, waited @ NUM6 hours for my @ CAPS3 and sister to finish @ CAPS1 at the end, finished the job.
One day I was patient was when we all had to take the same ride at @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1's out we were going to do this ride and where tons of people were lining up for it and I had to wait patient in line because I was at the back of the line and we stood there for about half an hour waiting to make the ride, then we wait there patient and the ride was stupid and it doesn't even go up @ NUM1 sets of stairs and then we did a whole bunch of rides in a water park and then we got home.
Patience, in my words, is being able to wait a long time for something and not be angry and raise your blood pressure. Patience is a good thing to have because if you didn't have patience you would probably never be able to accomplish something that takes time to do. I think being patient would help you be successful in a lot of things. For example my mom and I were in the drive-thru @ ORGANIZATION1 and the lady in front of us was yelling at people in the line to go faster, when you do something like that it probably won't speed up. My mom has exceptional patience because she can wait for things for hours on end and not get frustrated. I rarely have patience, I can't wait more than ten minutes for something. Patience is good because you probably don't have to get things done. Most of my family and I don't have the best patience, but sometimes we do. I think patience is very good to have.
My mom was a pation because when I got home late from the park she was a pation, but she wasn't a pation when she picked up the phone, she wasn't a pation. When my brother arrives, he has pations for him and my sister but none for me. Just because I got home NUM1 minutes late she said she had pasta before me and now she has some pasta for me just a little.
One time I was patient was when it was winter and my cousin and I really wanted to go out. I kept saying "@ CAPS1 you can go out". My cousin was very angry, she was having a fit. I was just sitting there on my couch telling her what my mom was saying. After an hour, I was able to go out, but my cousin couldn't. She was not patient. It was a time when I was patient.
I was patient once because I was hunting it was a cold room @ DATE1 I sit blind with my dad waiting for a deterrent. It's almost eight o'clock and we've been there from @ NUM1. We hear the ducks and geese making noise in the swamp next to us, we could see the trees dancing in the wind. Feel the dance of the grass waste and the morning fog. Then to nowhere at @ TIME1AM then came another doe. They cautiously walked past us, so I prepared the weapon. Then came out the group of eight points that I shot in his heart and lungs. I also emptied it. The year at @ DATE2 in the youth hunt I was patient and it paid off.
@ CAPS5 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 loved playing various games with his younger brother @ PERSON1 @ CAPS2 ! One day when she was playing sorry with @ PERSON1, unfortunately @ PERSON1 was having a bad time too. @ CAPS5 was getting extremely angry with @ LOCATION1 for taking so long. So @ CAPS5 started screaming. As you can imagine, when @ CAPS5 and @ CAPS8 @ PERSON2 from @ PERSON1 heard this, she ran to @ CAPS5 and @ PERSON1. She questioned @ CAPS5 with a worried look on her face. She said to @ CAPS5 "@ CAPS5 my dear, why are you shouting ? I sure hope you aren't shouting at @ PERSON1 ! " "@ CAPS4 I was, but that's only because @ PERSON1 didn't don't hurry ! ” @ CAPS5 exclaimed. “ @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 apologizes to @ PERSON1 for being so bitter and not letting him take his time. He's younger than you, which means he doesn't know any better. @ CAPS8, @ PERSON2, exclaimed forcefully. I'm so sorry @ PERSON1 ! " @ PERSON3 said with a tear streaming down his cheek. So they kissed and patiently continued their game of forgiveness.
Once I was patient was when my sister got her license. When we got there she pulled out a ticket from a michenie then he said # @ NUM1, the screen said @ NUM2. I did say it should be short, @ CAPS1 not like each person was half an hour @ NUM3 min if we were lucky. We stood still for @ NUM4 strait hours. Hope it won't take that long for my license.
My name is @ PERSON1, I am in the @ NUM1 class. But the problem we have today is patience. One thing you need to know is that if you don't have any kind of patience, you want to go anywhere in life. Everywhere you go you need patience. You won't have friends if you aren't patient. Patience will make you grow in life. Let's just say you got a letter in the mail saying you need to be at the Social Security office in two days. So when you go you have to get your ticket number and sit down, it can take hours but you can't just leave because if you do you want to get what you want. Here is another example, let's just say if you had to go to the doctor because you are sick you have to wait, you should because if the doctor made you go get the drug, @ CAPS1 are some results on patience.
Once there was a huge. Project!!! I needed to know what my grade was !! It was important gatherings because it was a difference between a @ CAPS1- to a @ CAPS2 !! So I was go ????????? it would be a ???? and???? ??? cats " here are a few of them that stand out and I was pragmatic for her , say my hand, @ CAPS3 she saw my name I was so glad I was afraid of the recipient !!! so i was patient for the bill, and you see ??? ??? Should come out.
Being patient is like being a good person. If you are a patiat, then good ??? will infuse you. Some have patience ??? Well ??? like moving, ???, and ??? but a little patience that you could do ??? are you the bad one ???
Pacification is a difficult skill to master. Pacience is a mental game. Peace comes into everyone's life. If you don't have pacification, then you have more anger. Peace for these miners stuck in a mine for two months. College takes a seal of years. Patience is essential here as well. Peace is among people everywhere, whether it's waiting for a toy or waiting for God to save your calm, it's something that will stay here forever.
It's a story of when I was patient. It was four o'clock in @ TIME1, I was in bed sleeping. It was dead silence. Suddenly I woke up to the sound of footsteps, it was my father. Out of nowhere, my bright light came on and I narrowed my eyes and put the blanket over my head. My dad shouted, "Time to go, @ CAPS1 !" I replied "ok!" I rushed out of bed, got dressed, had breakfast, grabbed my bag, and put it in the trunk of my mom's car. It was in the middle of @ DATE1, and we were on our way to @ LOCATION1. I knew I had to be patient so I put a movie in the @ CAPS2 player for me and my brother @ CAPS3 to watch. It started to get brighter and I was still watching movies while everyone else was asleep. Right for my dad, of course, he was the driver. When everyone woke up, we pulled over for food and gas. I was very patient, as I had to wait for everyone to wake up before I could eat. After eating, we got back in the car and drove off. A few hours later, we arrived at @ LOCATION1. I was ??? to get there I got out of the car and yelled "finally" It was the story of how patient I was.
The time @ TIME1 I was patient with was @ TIME1. Because we had to go to the town of @ LOCATION1 to pick something up and it took about @ NUM1 @ NUM2 minutes. Then on the way back we took another @ NUM1 @ NUM2 minutes on both trips, it was boring. But I had to be patient also this morning, I had to be patient because my brother was taking a shower and I wanted him so I had to be patient because it takes about @ NUM5 minutes. @ TIME1 @ TIME1 we had chocolate milk my mom was going to do it and we had to be patient for her to do it
Patience is important. If you don't have patience, you can easily get angry. You will have a lot more friends if you are patient. Patience always leads to good things. Often times people do something and become pacified. It would have been much easier if they were patient.
Sometimes when people take a long time, my family is obvious. My father has to be patient because when he is deployed to a new country he has to wait so long to come back and see his family again. My mom has to be patient because sometimes her coworkers or even the people there really annoy her. My brother must be patient because there is always something in the mail that is still waiting. My sister is patient because she has to take care of me and my brother. My brother and I are patient because we have to sit for an hour on the bus so that we have nothing else to do but sit there and look like we are bored. My brothers and sisters are also patient and wait until the end of the school year. My dad is also patient because he has to finish his bait tests which takes a long time, along with all of my sister and mom moaning about why we don't need them. I am always patient when I have to finish the day of school with my brother, I can be patient when he has to sit down and wait about thirty minutes at a time for his computer to charge. In short, my family is really patient, whether they are sitting in the office or deployed to a new country, my family is always patient.
Have you ever been patient? At times, people lose their patients in many ways. Examples of lost patients may be waiting in a line to ride a roller coaster, as that can sometimes take forever. Having patients can be a good thing. Calm down and you don't have to be upset with something like standing in line somewhere for a long time. Being a patient person also means that you have the ability to wait for something, unlike people without patients, as these people will struggle while waiting for something. In conclusion, I think having patients will sometimes help you be successful in life. If you are not patient, try not to be patient because someday the thing you want or expect will happen.
It was a light and windy morning. It was @ NUM1 @ CAPS1, my parents were just finishing packing for @ LOCATION1 @ LOCATION1. We go to A @ LOCATION1 because my sister has a lacrosse terna at @ LOCATION2. It's a terrifying thirteen hours. We started to walk towards a van with suitcases. My grandparents come with us because they usually stay on @ DATE1. This even more stressful. We were about to leave, then I remembered we had a TV in our van. I ran into the house and unplugged my gamecabe @ ORGANIZATION1. I took all the wires and three game controllers and then left. We started our journey. As we have just left, I begin to plug in all the wires and the game controls. Here we begin. During the first hours of listening, we just listened to the radio. Then came the effect of my brother and sister never going well in a crowded place, so we started hunting. Now where @ NUM2 hours this and we were at @ LOCATION1. We started to see mountains. They were wonderful. @ NUM3 hours through. We decided to watch the ??? movie for the last hour. The hour passed like a flash. Anyway it was a time when I was kind of a patient.
My @ CAPS3 once planned a fishing trip at @ LOCATION1. @ CAPS8 @ CAPS1 I don't know. He told me to pack my suitcase for three days of clothes. I explained why he said we are going to @ LOCATION1 tomorrow with your loved ones @ PERSON1 and ryan. I was so excited I flew to my room and put some rags in my @ CAPS2 and went through everything I would need. I asked my @ CAPS3 what we were doing there he said we were going pike fishing in the @ CAPS4 river. The @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 I got a new cherry tree fishing rod and a really nice real underspin. So I packed my fishing rods in my @ CAPS7 and fell asleep so I could get up early. @ NUM1 came and my alarm went off. I was so cramped I could barely see @ CAPS8, we had to be at my uncle's at @ NUM2 so I had to prepare. When we got to my uncles, we met them and then we all left. I wanted to sleep in the car @ CAPS8 I couldn't once we got to @ LOCATION1 it was so cool with the huge cliffs and hills we even got a bear @ CAPS10 a river we stopped at then we went up the river and there was a clear mud hole with millions of frogs in it. When we finally got there, my @ CAPS3 made me wait and unpack. After my causin and I unpacked @ CAPS12, we went straight to the store to fish my first cast. I grabbed a small @ NUM3 incher on an @ ORGANIZATION1. After that we didn't catch anything so we came back when there was @ CAPS13 and hot dogs roasting on the fire. The next morning we got up early and only fished on the lake @ CAPS10 on @ LOCATION3 we didn't catch anything. That night we went river fishing @ CAPS4 and we still haven't caught anything. The guy who owned the cabin said we should cath @ NUM4 or @ NUM5 pike a @ CAPS5 @ CAPS8 it had rained seven feet so they weren't feeding. The next @ CAPS5 we got up early again and fished all @ CAPS5. In the morning, I had a stroke, we had nothing afterwards. At lunch we found a little @ LOCATION2 to have lunch on it, there was a real rock cave and we had scared a bear from @ LOCATION2. Later we went to this little canyon which was really hard to air condition. I almost fell halfway @ CAPS19 @ CAPS8 I was watched on a root. We saw another bear eating berries that we filmed and we killed a chipmunk with a stone @ CAPS21 that we threw @ CAPS19. Wham he almost took my perch i fought him for about ten minutes i waited and waited it was a giant pike @ CAPS8 he shaped my line and i've never seen this pike yet.
Back when I was in my third year or so, I had to be very patient. I was at a match from @ ORGANIZATION1. It was almost the seventh inning and I was ready to take the pitch. I had to wait a very long time. I had already missed about one end of the game. When I was there there were about @ NUM1 people. There were so many people. My mom probably could have filled three two-gigabit memory cards by this time. It was so boring. After about twenty minutes, they finally let us enter the field. We've all been through the outfield and the infield. Most of us were on live TV, I was one of them. After the game was over, most people left sad, but I left happy and sad. People were sad because @ ORGANIZATION1 lost the game. The reason I was happy was because I got to go to the field.
For some people it is as hard as a rock, but for others it comes naturally. Patience is a big part of the hunt. You must be tolerant and understanding. Even if things seem to be turning for the worse. Take this for example. I woke up at six o'clock and jumped out of bed. I was finally going to kill my first deer! I put on my camouflage and hunter orange as my grandfather drove my long road to find me. The moonlight was shining bright and I was laughing with excitement, but I knew I had to calm down. As we drove to where I was going to hunt, I was amazed at how quiet everything was. We returned to the blind on a leafy path and put everything in its place. After, dosing a little the morning light seemed to pierce through the trees and light up the cool green field. The water vapor looked like sparks floating in the air. We heard a grouse drum and a red squarle jumped on us, but no deer. After a long morning of sitting, we decided to pack our bags. We always had tomorrow. So that was the end of our hunt. We had an exciting time, and it was all about the patience. Patience @ MONTH1 doesn't always help the way you want it to, but it can help you see a lot of different and beautiful things.
Once @ CAPS1 mom took a test to become @ CAPS2. It means certified nursing assistant. After taking the test, she was very nervous. She waited and waited. A phone call was coming very soon, but she had to have patients. The first day she took the test, it was very difficult to get patients. I understood because I have this feeling when I wait for the test results. It is scary and exciting. The next day was not so hard. She just got on with her day. On the third day of the wait, she began to wonder if the call would come. Later that day the phone rang. A smile spread across his face. She had passed the test. This is the time when @ CAPS1 mom showed patients for three whole days !
It can be very difficult to be patient, depending on the effect. Even I lose my patience sometimes. But once, I was so patient that I was about to explode. On a dry day on @ DATE1, my family and I decide to go on an exciting vacation to @ ORGANIZATION1. We drove @ LOCATION1 to @ LOCATION2 and headed east towards @ ORGANIZATION1. After the boring road trip, we parked our silver minivan in a five dollar parking lot right next to @ ORGANIZATION1. First we climbed the @ CAPS1 tower, where we saw everything from an incredible height. After that, we saw our cousins. I've never even seen them before. As we were looking at the waterfall my brother said, “ @ CAPS2, look at these boats under the waterfall. Dad, can we go ? " " @ CAPS3, but we must first buy tickets. " @ CAPS4 my father. We bought the tickets and stood in line. "@ CAPS5 are there that many people?" I asked. There were about @ NUM1 people standing in line with us. "@ CAPS6 be patient," replied my father. I stood there looking at all the people in front of us. We were never going to get on the boat. I saw people handing out blue rain jackets. After @ NUM2 minutes, we still haven't received the jackets. We were moving as slowly as the plates were on the earth. Finally, we got a jacket, but we weren't on a boat yet. My brother was complaining and my dad started yelling at him. I was still standing, about to explode. Finally, they called us on the boat. It was amazing going under the waterfall. We were in the mist. When we got back to shore we talked about how amazing it was. Being patient has a payoff in the end. Even though it is difficult to be patient, I still did it and anyone can do it. I was patient the whole time in the queue to get on the boat. Patience can be rewarding.
In third grade, one day it was one of the happiest days of my life. It was the day we were going to pick up our dog @ ORGANIZATION1 and I was excited and still so patient. It was a cold winter day and it was time for me to go to school and I couldn't @ CAPS1 wait until the end of the school day because that was the day we got @ ORGANIZATION1. When I got to school I couldn't wait @ CAPS1 to tell everyone that today is the day. When school was over, my mom picked up my sister and I from school to come home and patiently wait at home for my dad and @ ORGANIZATION1 to come home. When we got home my mom and two sisters and I were waiting patient in the living room watching @ CAPS1.V just listening for the red door open. And we herded her open and we all jumped up and down running and screaming out and there she was @ ORGANIZATION1 the best dog in the world. This is how I was patient on winter day patiently waiting for the best dog in the world.
?? It was a normal old boring day in @ DATE1 but I just got a call from my sister in law. She literally called me and asked if I wanted to go to Cedar Point the next day. I was amazed! I did not know what to say ! At first I thought she was hiding, but when she asked to speak to my mom I knew she was legit. ??? When she finished talking to my mom, my mom was in shock too. I was so grateful that I couldn't fall asleep. I ended up waking up to @ NUM1 am and didn't like it, but it was totally worth it. It was a long two hour drive but when we got there we bought our tickets and ??? the mavric. The line was humumus but we waited. Halfway through the line, the ride broke down. I couldn't believe my eyes. I always wanted to get on that one. I was ??. We waited patiently for about @ NUM2 @ NUM3 hours maybe @ NUM4. I was hungry, very hungry and cooking in the sun. once it reopened we only had to cry for half an hour but overall it was worth it. My sister-in-law @ PERSON1 was very impressed with the patience with which I waited. And we went to the car to get food. It was the best food I have ever had. The rest of the day was great, but it was certainly the most patient I have ever been in my life. Since it was just me and @ PERSON1, I think that's why I was so calm. Even though that part of the day sucked, it was still a good time for us!
This year mom married my new stepfather. I guess he wanted us to bond, so we started to trap. It's pretty much the same as clay pigeon shooting, it's actually the same. Anyway, he was a cop and had a shotgun so we went to try him out. It did not work. I missed every bird that I targeted in clay. I only had one baby through the thing. But I was cool with it, I knew I was bad because it was the first time. So we gave it a shot, the thing died in the middle. I felt shown. We left that day with only ten hits and countless misses. I felt pretty low. The following week we tried again. He launched the bird and it's almost as if in slow motion I watched him. I followed him with the bullet at the end of the pistol and fired the triser and watched the bird explode. Haha, did I do it fanatically? We threw another one and I hit it, I went to @ NUM1 soaring ! Amazing for someone who missed a few for And that's how I was patient.
A time I was patient is when our family goes to point @ CAPS1. My family and I often go to point @ CAPS1. Usually the queues are very long, sometimes over an hour! Once, my first time on the @ CAPS3, the wait was @ NUM1 hours, but we went anyway. We were about @ NUM2 hours, then they had some technical difficulty. After about @ NUM3 min the line was moving again. When I was able to ride it was really fun (although it only lasted @ NUM4 seconds) A few years later the new Le @ CAPS4 lap opened up and it looked great fun, but not the line. I don't know how long we waited, but when we made it all the way to the end and made the trip it was amazing. I was glad I had enough patience to wait in those long lines.
What is patience? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulty without complaining, most people are impatient nowadays. Patience is like waiting. For example, if you are in a traffic jam in a long line, or maybe you have to wait your turn for something. Patience is one of the best qualities you can have. Every year more and more people get impatient. @ CAPS1 wants people to "hurry" or "move faster". @ CAPS1 must gain patience by breathing deeply or calming down. I think the world would be more peaceful if everyone had patience there would be no more conflict and if that ever happened everyone's life would be perfect.
@ PERSON3 and the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. Vincenta was walking one day and @ CAPS9 saw her friend @ PERSON5. "@ CAPS3, a - @ PERSON3". Said @ PERSON5, "@ PERSON5 you know how to call me @ PERSON3", replied @ CAPS4. (@ CAPS5-shen-tay) "@ PERSON3, my mom told me to make sure @ CAPS12 beans get to @ PERSON1. Would you do it for me? " @ PERSON5 asked "cee, @ CAPS21 from @ LOCATION2 supports each other. " @ CAPS6 you @ CAPS28 ! I have to go now! Goodbye! " @ PERSON5 said @ CAPS9 ran away. @ PERSON3 went to @ PERSON2 and knocked on the door. @ CAPS16 answered. @ CAPS7 @ PERSON3 walked over to @ LOCATION1's old house . Dropped out, I know! I'm going @ CAPS8 here ! " @ CAPS7 @ CAPS9 dug a hole and planted the beans. @ NUM1 minutes later @ CAPS9 was still waiting. " @ CAPS8 ! " @ CAPS9 shouted. @ PERSON4 was walking and @ PERSON3 soul was angry. '@ CAPS4, @ CAPS14, are you a screaming boy? You are going to wake my grandpa ! @ CAPS11 exclaimed, "@ CAPS12 stupid beans don't grow @ PERSON4. " @ CAPS9 replied :" @ CAPS14 do you want to see beans ? Go to bed, they'll be right where below! @ CAPS11 told him. "@ CAPS16 ! I'll stay here! Eizel will back me up on this one, haven't you heard of this guy" @ CAPS17 " ? " "@ CAPS18, @ CAPS19 will see you later @ PERSON3." And @ CAPS11 left. The next day @ PERSON5 walked past " oh my god ! @ PERSON3" @ CAPS9 shouted. @ PERSON3 woke up and couldn't believe what @ CAPS9 saw. The Tracked Bean ran @ CAPS21 on @ LOCATION1's two-story house. “ You stink ! »@ CAPS20 cavd @ CAPS21 suddenly @ PERSON3 woke up. It was a dream, @ CAPS9 watched the @ CAPS23. "@ CAPS24 !" always nothing. A day later @ CAPS9 was still waiting hungry and tired, @ PERSON4 returned. " @ PERSON5 doesn't know, does it @ CAPS9 ?" Well, @ PERSON3 please come in and forget about the seeds. “@ CAPS16,” @ CAPS9 shouted. " You're just going to get mad " @ CAPS16 ! Go away! @ CAPS9 shouted. "@ CAPS27 ! I'm going" and @ CAPS11 stomped again. Two @ DATE1 waiting and finally popped up. One was alive and lasted @ NUM1 minutes then passed away. The other was just a car bolt. @ PERSON3 had bone bugs for the @ DATE1 and was putting air inside @ NUM3. Then @ CAPS9 asked, " Was it worth it ?" » Cee-oui @ CAPS28-ami
Being patient is a very difficult thing to do, most people are very bad but some are good. I am one of those bad at it. The hardest thing I have ever done in my life is stand in line for three and a half hours just to ride the dragster to Cedar Point. It was a very hot sticky day @ DATE1 and the cedar tip was packed. There were flies everywhere, tickling your legs, buzzing in your ear and even biting you. You could hear the screams a mile away. Overweight people wore shorts and tank tops and ate popcorn. It was brutal! I had driven every ride except the dragster. The dragster is the merry-go-round that takes you to the top and brings you down as fast as a bullet. The only problem, if you wanted the first basket, which @ CAPS3 did, was a three and a half hour wait! “@ CAPS1 can @ CAPS3 just go to the skyscraper again,” I pleaded. "@ CAPS2 ! @ CAPS3 came up to @ LOCATION1 ; @ CAPS3 won't leave without having the best funniest lap! You're going to stand in that line and wait! @ CAPS1 responded quickly. " @ CAPS5 ! I never get what I want, do I ! " " You get whatever you want. You can go around the skyscraper again if you want, but I'm staying here! And I feel bad for those who have to sit next to you because they're going to get bruises and scratches all over their arms. Damn, you could burst their eardrums by screaming so much ! " " Well, I do not want to inflict that pain on anyone else but you, I could ! By the time @ CAPS3 was done fighting there were only twenty minutes left, @ CAPS3 hadn't had a cart before, the wait wasn't even that bad.
One time I was patient was when I was helping a kid in my class with his project. We were doing a science project and this kid didn't understand a thing. He was putting things in the wrong place, writing things that were wrong with science, and he was not listening to anything so he was right but he lost it! I couldn't believe he had lost all of our hard work ! So we started over and I helped him more and was very patient with him. After three days, we were almost done. When he was done putting the finishing touches, he presented it and got an A + on it; @ CAPS1 he got an A + on it made me feel so good and i was rewarded for my hard work and patience with him. In the end, being patient makes you feel good, and the person you've helped feels good too. It was a time when I was patient.
Once upon a time a little girl named @ PERSON2 @ CAPS10 was the important girl in storytelling land. The story was a small felled land with loving and patient people waiting for everything. And every child was patient except @ PERSON2. @ PERSON2 was an only child living with her mother and @ CAPS12. @ PERSON2 hated being the only child then: @ PERSON2's mother named @ CAPS3 told her husband @ CAPS1 that they should have another chilled so that @ PERSON2 is not alone. Soon they told @ PERSON2 that @ CAPS10 would have a baby brother or sister @ PERSON2 was very happy. In fact, @ PERSON2 was so happy that @ CAPS10 climbed the stairs and started making up baby names. Then walked down the stairs and shared them with her mother, swinging in her chain. I love kuven said @ CAPS12 walking over to the dinner table were @ PERSON2 and her mom were sitting. Ok said @ PERSON2 cleaning the table of "Do you like @ CAPS2, @ CAPS3, @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS4, @ CAPS5 or @ CAPS6" said. @ PERSON2. I love @ PERSON1 said @ CAPS12 pushing up on his chair. Me too, said Mom, walking up the stairs to her bedroom. " Can't wait for the baby to come, " @ PERSON2 said as she walked up the stairs. The next morning @ PERSON2 woke up early to see if her mother had had the baby. @ CAPS7 you still have the baby "said @ PERSON2 weakening her mother and @ CAPS12" @ CAPS8 "said on @ CAPS12," the baby has to grow inside mum okay.

Kerry got up very early screaming "is @ CAPS7 coming" @ CAPS8, "the mother said, keeping her head above her stomach to see @ PERSON2." this baby will never come i hate this thing i will be alone forever, @ PERSON2 said as he walked to his room. Be patient @ CAPS10 will come yelling @ CAPS12 from the other room. "@ CAPS10" said @ PERSON2 it's a girl "@ PERSON2 got very happy @ NUM1 hour later" oh, oh, oh "the mother shouted from her bedroom.

"@ PERSON2" yes "mother is going to have to deliver this baby okay. @ NUM3 hours later, daddy came home running up the stairs and went to his room and saw @ PERSON2 his wife @ CAPS11 and the new baby @ PERSON1 sound asleep. I told you if you were patient @ CAPS10 would come " said " @ CAPS12 talking to himself
Some stories where I was patient is when I needed the help of a teacher, my grandmother had surgery, I was waiting for the turn of the sport and my mother was at the job. When my grandmother had the operation, we waited three hours. During this time, I was playing chess with my aunt. I spoke with them. We went to the gift shop there. We also went to the mall. The teacher gave us homework (hw) and I didn't understand part of it. The teacher was helping another person so I waited. I skipped the part came back so the teacher could help me. Then I figured out the homework. My mom would take me to her work after school where I would be home alone. In the meantime, I wiped the floor. I rested my head and put it on the table. I chatted with some of the staff and spent some time walking back and forth. These are the stories of a time when I was patient.
A time when @ CAPS2's daddy was patient. @ CAPS2 dad was patient because he had an important meeting with his boss hasn't come yet so @ CAPS2 dad sat down and waited. He waited and @ NUM1 hours later the boss came over and said "@ CAPS1 you wait another hour because need to talk to @ CAPS2 wife because she says she really needs to talk to me" @ CAPS2 daddy said "@ CAPS3 but hurry up!" In the hour that passes @ CAPS5 the boss came he came he said to @ CAPS2 daddy "@ CAPS4 for waiting" @ CAPS5 finally he finished for his meeting. I told daddy what took you so long, "he said, be patient. That's when @ CAPS2's daddy became patient.
@ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 my cell phone vibrates in my pocket. Lexa, @ CAPS2. I don't know if I will ever be able to get over the argument we had yesterday after she insulted me. I actually answered once and said that sometimes I @ CAPS5 need to be patient. She definitely isn't listening. So I decide to call her back. She picks up on the first ring. @ CAPS3, are you there? "She seems desperate to call me the nickname she always has" yes "" I'm sosososorry, I didn't mean it ". ' 'I told you I need some time and you have to be patient.' 'I said almost in tears.' 'I know but I can't be when I @ CAPS5 hurts my best friend ''. '' Patience means you understand & tolerant of waiting without complaining ''. '' @ CAPS4 ''. '' @ CAPS5 try to be patient and @ MONTH1 be you won't complain. "" @ CAPS6 "she said then hangs up. Of course I think I'm so angry she thinks she can @ CAPS5 and that would be better. She should have waited." I'm just that she had been patient. "
One day it was my mom and I we were going to the store @ CAPS1 we had to pick up my big brother in basketball practice @ CAPS1 we got there and he was not outside of @ CAPS1 my mom was calling his phone and he wasn't answering @ CAPS1 my mom keeps calling @ CAPS1 my mom said he was going to wait for him to come out now, that's what I call patience.
There was a time when someone I knew was patient. I was on a cold day @ DATE1 and I was in school. My teacher was very ill, so we had a replacement. He was a very nasty replacement. All of a sudden, a child started to breathe hard. He needed his inhaler. I told the sub the kid needed to get it but he said no. the person next to me said the right thing to say but was patient and said "ok" @ CAPS1 the sub let the kid go. It was the time when someone I know was patient.
Patient! I was patient when I waited for my football game. It was a @ DATE1 @ TIME1 and I went to get my shoulder pads, my helmet and my soccer pants. We woke up early @ CAPS3 when we were going to be the first there, I was thinking wrong. There were like @ NUM1 people there. I was panicking, panicked dude! I said to my mother "you said well be early you said well be the first to hear". Well, she was totally worn out. I was angry with her. We were the last in line. All the good helmets were gone. Mom said "@ CAPS1 you have to be patient like other parents. @ CAPS3 I tried to be patient. It didn't work well with @ CAPS3. I was @ CAPS3 impatient, I was screaming and saying" Okay, we don't have time for you to sit all day, we don't have Christmas time. @ CAPS2 when I got there I said out loud "@ CAPS2! Football stuff went crazy on me," @ CAPS3 "I said" Hope they are my size for my football stuff soccer. Just what they didn't do. I was crazy about @ CAPS3 and just what she said "come back tomorrow and get your size right. Well that's my story, I was a little patient towards the end, but at first I was screaming, @ CAPS3 which shows you that if you are not patient you probably won't get what you expect all day.
My favorite books, now a movie, I have to see it. Twilight Eclips, my mom and I would go to the movies and I kept talking about the movie. We entered the parking lot and @ CAPS1 was nowhere to park. My mom was about to leave before I told her, “ The only mom from @ CAPS1 ” “ Honey, ” she replied. My mom and I had been waiting to see the bloody movie for three months, and we would walk into the building and rush out to get the tickets and the food. The film was going to start at @ NUM1. I was about to start to say something but I calmed down and was patient for three hours. I took pictures of me and my mom being funny. We did a bunch of random things to pass the time. It actually helped the security stand up for trivia. They asked a bunch of questions about the latest movie "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3". I raised my hand and answered the question correctly. I had the choice of getting a free popcorn or a pin. I have the pin. I was so excited the movie was about to start. After the movie was over, my mom and I got home and fell asleep just as we got @ CAPS1. This was the story where I used patience.
" ? Can we look @ ORGANIZATION1. ” I looked at the clock. Half past five. "You'll have to wait." I said. "@ CAPS3 doesn't light until eight o'clock." “@ CAPS1 I want to watch @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 z @ ORGANIZATION1. he ??? Not yet. I thought. Do we have to live this every day. Why haven't I yet ???. I walked slowly to my room, knowing that I should babysit ??? @ CAPS2. ??? until eight o'clock "kumehnn" @ CAPS2 calm. " I was starting to go crazy. " @ CAPS3 doesn't turn on for eight o'clock okay. "
I am never patient. Whether it's waiting for dinner or waiting for a friend, I'm never patient. The only time I can be patient is when I'm waiting for school to start. I can wait hours, days, weeks, months, even years if I wait for school to start. Then the thing I can never be patient with is waiting for a friend to call because I always want to do something every second. I'll run around the house for hours until a friend calls. ?? when they call, I run straight to the phone and answer right away. I'll even sit there and watch the phone while waiting for someone to call. Another thing I can be patient with is waiting for my mom to tell me to clean my room. I will always leave the house and try not to come back until bedtime so that I never have to clean my room.
My cousin was patient when we queued for the top I go @ CAPS1 at (cedar point. The queue almost took @ NUM1 hours. My cousin was just quiet) and I was just waiting. I was very impatient. I stamped my feet while running etc. I was about to die of boredom. My legs hurt, I was hungry, I was too hot. I just couldn't stanistrn. She was just standing there without speaking. When we started moving I became a little happier but still impatient. After @ NUM1 hours, we finally entered the ride. After the ride, I asked my cousin why she was so quiet. She said her mom said for every word one of us said we had a minute of homework when we got back to @ LOCATION1. I was stuck doing my homework the next week. This is how I learned my lesson to be patient
Being patient means that when you're in a bad situation, you don't complain. Some people are not patient and some are very patient. Patience is very important to me, I like to think of myself as a kind of patient or I think I am. I once had to be very patient when my family had to drive fourteen hours to get to @ LOCATION1 it was no fun. A bad thing about it was that you always had to go to the bathroom. Once you have the privilege of leaving when you want to be kidnapped, you want it even more. But I kept telling myself, be patient, we'll stop at the next place. Another thing was that you were always hungry or thirsty. We only stopped three times so it wasn't fun. Also, every time you had food it wasn't enough. But I didn't complain. Finally you really want to get there, you couldn't wait for the sandy beaches and the waves. Seemed like we would never get there, it wasn't the best experience. When we finally got there I realized the trip was like a big test of patience and I stuck, and it actually wasn't as bad as the return trip.
One day, I went to the hospital, the nurses gave me an ivy scan, an akatt scan and removed the defect from my arm. It hurt so much but I was patient during it all. First of all, when I had a CT scan I didn't want to do it, but we had to do it, so I did and was very patient. Also, when they gave me my ivy, they missed my vain, so the ripened put it in my other arm, so I was very patient for the pain to subside. Finally when I had finished at @ NUM1 hours and started at @ NUM1 hours there was a big piece of duct tape on my bow for @ NUM3 hours the nurse came over and said "we can go home. home now "and said" you can take the tape now darling. " I said " ok ", pulled it piece by piece, then the nurse said " let me do it !" " She said" @ NUM4, NUM5 @, @ NUM6 "and withdrew, it hurt so much but I was patient and I did not cry or ??? Now you know I have been patient and hurt all day.
I was patient when my dad said he would bring me @ CAPS1. They were @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 the caust @ MONEY1 shoes. I asked a few times. He didn't respond, so I knew what to do. I decided on the dishes, cleaned my room. I have waited so much for the shoes; I cleaned things that were already clean. After a month of cleaning, I still haven't had the shoes on. This is how something went wrong. SCHOOL !!!!!!! I didn't play well at school. I gathered my things. Then I got the @ CAPS4.
Don't you just love to wait for something to come or happen and when you realize it was worth the wait? I know yes! Sometimes the wait is too long and you just need to be patient. Patience is very important. I had to be patient several times before. Recently I had to be patient. I used it to wait for the birth of my little cousin @ CAPS1. I had to wait a long time @ NUM1 weeks to be exact! I was so excited that I couldn't stay together. Just yesterday she was born. The wait is over and I feel a reat. However, I still have to be patient to see her. But not much longer just until I get out of school. I've waited so long that I can't even take it! Every day I used to mark it on my calendar. I thought. She will be here soon. But, the days never seem to go by fast enough. I kept asking my mom how many more days. It was pure agony! As the day approached, I got more and more excited. She had gotten a lot of clothes from people. I had to be even more patient to even see the clothes on her. I also had to be patient to hold it. Although I already said some time ago that I have to be the first cousin to hold her. Now that she is born and finally here I can be the first to hold her, I can stop counting, see her in her new clothes and stop disturbing my mom. So overall, patience is important. If you use it, the thing you would expect is much better.
Patience is a nice thing, people are patient, but always complain about it, it's not patience at all. Patience is waiting and being kind while you are doing it. People who lose patience easily are really not cool, it's good when someone is waiting for you if you say you're talking to someone else on the phone, or even on the internet or something. It's very polite if you have patience i don't know the definition but i will guess i think this is a person who patiently and calmly waits for the other person even if they need to go somewhere.
Aooooh when I have seven, I could make the hunt hoder ; this capable hints forever, alex mictiory adverinter wea a fun place ??? the ??? this routen. as I was waiting in the queue to ride the ???

Patience is a quality or characteristic of a person. It is not easy to be patient, but some people are very patient. Especially when you know you want to be mad at someone, but you don't. My older brother has always been patient with me, especially the time that I look back and wish I could erase. It was that night that I was going to stay with @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON4, my aunt and uncles. I had always had a hard time staying at home because I came home sick and cried. This is exactly what @ CAPS2 happened that night, I regret it. @ PERSON3, @ PERSON6 and I were playing games in their bedroom. I couldn't stop thinking about my mother. I said to myself over and over again " stiff upper lip ". I had forgotten about her for a while, then the feeling came back, so I thought how much fun I would have tomorrow if I stayed the night. It didn't work, tears flowed faster than @ CAPS1 falls. "I want to go home," I managed to sniffle. I ran downstairs to tell my older cousin @ PERSON1, who was babysitting. @ CAPS3 finally opened her door and took me upstairs to pick up the phone. My mom responded and realized it was my voice and said “@ CAPS2” all cranky. I sniffled and said "I want to go home, I miss you." and sniffed more. "Someone will come and pick you up soon." Be packed and ready. @ CAPS3 said and hung up. I unfortunately told @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON6 as I was packing my bags and waiting on the wooden bench by the door. Soon a car pulled into the driveway and honked its horn. It was @ PERSON5, I said goodbye once more and got out in the cold, windy and hopped in @ LOCATION1's car. “ @ CAPS4, didn't you want to stay ? " @ Person5 asked calmly. "I do not know." And that was only mentioned when I walked through our front door. I already knew my punishment, not to spend the night somewhere for a few weeks.
I had to be patient several times. I had to be patient when my @ CAPS1 broke my eardrum, I was waiting for radios, I was waiting to go on stage. These are times when I had to be patient. When my @ CAPS1 broke my eardrum, I was about five years old. I had to wait with my brother in the waiting room. It was like an eternity. It was winter, I was in my pajamas, and so bored but worried about my @ CAPS1. In @ NUM1 grade, I hit my wrist in a door and a wall. I was in the ER for @ NUM2 to @ NUM3 hours, but they were very good at their job. My mom and I were stuck watching @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 on the TV they had. It was very cold in the waiting room and I had @ CAPS6 on my wrist. Finally, I was waiting to go on stage for my grade @ NUM1 concert. I was so nervous and the needs kept growing. I waited @ NUM5 min but felt like @ NUM5 years old. I was sitting next to my friend which helped me a bit. When we got on stage, I sang with all my heart and was glad I waited. These are sometimes what I was meant to be @ NUM7. I'm not good at being patient, but I waited and got some good results.
Have you ever been patient? I have it, especially this time in my life. The main period of my life was when I was waiting for my dog to have her babies. My dog's name is @ CAPS1 mae, she is three years old and is a full blood pit bull. ??? ??? ??? ??. it all started when we took @ CAPS1 to @ CAPS6 for his early check. The @ CAPS6 said she was fine then pulled my mom aside. My heart was beating faster than ever because usually when they put parents aside it means something bad. My mother cried out and rejoiced. I ran over to her and she screamed "@ CAPS3 is having babies" and then I screamed with her. We went to get dixixe and then we took her to the bark game and that night she had her own steak for supper. The following months passed faster than ever. Well, at least it looked like it. Now @ CAPS1 is growing. The @ CAPS6 said it should be at least six months until she has the puppies, it's been five and a half months already, Mom said, she has milk now ”, said. i told my sister, @ DATE1. "I wouldn't doubt it," @ DATE1 said and then we went to take @ CAPS1 inside for the night. The next day as I was getting ready for school my mom said 'hey sweetie I called @ CAPS6 and he said he wouldn't be surprised if @ CAPS1 had his puppies today' hui "then I said oh cool but don't rush @ CAPS1 she's going through a lot right now. “ Then we said goodbye and I went to the bus stop. The bus ride usually takes an hour to get to school, but today it was only thirty minutes. The day passed quickly. Before I knew I was home I walked through the front door and my mom said "Oh you are just in time honey @ CAPS3 having her babies" we both have ran into the garage faster than ever @ CAPS1 was lying on a blanket i scribbled at her and she licked my hand. I told him everything would be fine. I went to get her a bowl of water and some soft food and when I got out she already had two puppies. It took about an hour for the other two, then another hour for the other two after them. It turns out they were all girls. Now we have eight dogs in my house. The mom @ CAPS1 mae, the @ CAPS12 @ CAPS13, and the eight little puppy girls, cute, ankle boot. Tinker, bella, harmony and melody. I love my dogs!
The @ DATE1 the day of my docking. We're not going for a cake. I loved an ice cream cake. It was over @ NUM1 people. I didn't have any cuy pashints. But my mom did. Was it a playground night ??? this. So I want to go play. With my mom she came and got my wert to go and sell my povetg.
Patience can lead to rewards, @ PERSON4 the brown bear learned that @ DATE1 while standing in line to get an autograph from @ PERSON1. He might have been very frustrated, but he stayed calm and couldn't wait to meet @ PERSON3. One day @ PERSON4 saw a headline @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 in a newspaper. He put @ NUM1 in the machine and opened the newspaper rack at the first graduation he was stuck. He went to the gas station to tell the people but they weren't there, he pressed the top of the bell and no one came. @ PERSON4 was trying to be as patient as possible. He went to another store and got a newspaper there. The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 was her favorite star, @ PERSON2, was going to be in town. May rushed to Buggle town and saw the line that was @ NUM2 long ???. He was so excited to see @ person3. @ PERSON4 stood in line at @ TIME2 and has been there for @ NUM3 hour and only did @ NUM4 autographs. It was going to be a long day for @ PERSON4. @ PERSON4 got a hot dog and soda from the sidewalle food company at @ NUM5 pm. @ PERSON4 was still the last person on the line, his patience waned a bit. At @ TIME3, there were only @ NUM6 people, including him. He finally arrived at @ PERSON3 at @ TIME4 @ PERSON3 and his team informed @ PERSON4 that he had won the patience contest. They told her to be able to see her in concert, to get her phone number and to win a date with her. He was so happy that he remained patient for five hours. @ PERSON4 was about to blow at @ TIME1 knew he would never forget that moment. Also, @ PERSON4 ended up being @ PERSON3's boyfriend. That's when @ PERSON4 learned that patience can pay off.
When I was patient. It was a time when I was patient. There are more and more ways to get a patient @ CAPS1 when I'm in no rush to do something. I'll tell you a true story when I was patient. And I was in no rush to do it. My first day at school and we had fun with a bunch of people and that first day we had work. When we took care of doing it, some people weren't patient. I looked around the bright room and wondered how should I be patient, "@ CAPS1 I thought to myself" I have to take the time @ CAPS1 I could achieve a good grade and @ CAPS1 I was patient. The next day, I was ready to see my note on this job. I had fun this is the day I was patient and took my time.
When I was patient it was when I went to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. I waited patiently when riding the roller coaster. For an hour and a half. I waited patiently when I needed to find something to eat. I was patient when I wanted to get on one of the rides. It was a time when I was patient.
A time when I was patient was a last @ DATE1. My friend, @ CAPS1, took me to Cedar Point at @ LOCATION1. The place was so crowded that it took five minutes to get from the car to the entrance. When we walked in the place looked amazing! It was almost like a dream. They even had a tour to take you from one part of the park to the other. The first trip we did was the @ ORGANIZATION1. We waited, and waited about ten minutes, and then things got boring. It had been almost fifteen minutes and we weren't even near the merry-go-round! So we waited, and waited another ten minutes, and things went a little faster. At this part, the line was moving a little faster. Finally, it was our turn to ride. We had a yellow car and we could already feel the adrenaline. After we were strapped in, the person who locks people's seats said, “ Come on ! " And we took off like a bird. In the end, it was worth being patient
Have you ever been patient? Like at @ CAPS1's office? Well let me tell you a moment I have. Once I was really sick and started to cry because I was in so much pain. I cried for an hour straight. Then my mother took me to the hospital where she works. When I got out of the car, I stopped crying. I told my mom that I had stopped crying but she told me I had to go see @ CAPS1. When we entered we saw this man rushing towards the @ LOCATION1. We went straight to the waiting room and all the seats were occupied. When @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1 came out, she asked a man to see her with his son. This gave us two seats to sit on. After about @ CAPS2 minutes, she called us to a medical room. She examined me and I was very scared because I might have nomonia or a very bad virus. When she came out of her office, I was holding my mother's hand. She came up to us holding a piece of paper and my mother asked me what I had. Luckily she said I only had a cold and an ear infection. When we left the patient room, my mother had to pay. She only had to pay around? @ NUM1. We had to get my meds, so we walked to the elevator, went downstairs, and entered the pharmacy. The pharmacy was so full that I felt like a pancake under another pancake. When we got to the counter, my mom asked for my meds and she received them with a big pacifier. When I got home, I took drugs and I went to my bed. The next day I woke up and around @ TIME1 got the lollipop. It was a time when I was patient.
One day @ CAPS1 was ordering a dress with a pair of shoes and a ???. But when she ordered it, they said I ????????????????? Part not readable it had not yet arrived ??? you would ???? Rosy said "no thanks, I know ??? coming" said @ CAPS1. The next @ NUM1 months that the dress was ??? The magazine company called and said " We are so sorry for the late arrival of your dress," @ CAPS3 we will deliver at no charge and thank you for your patience. " @ CAPS3, she ordered two dresses and arrived the next day, always happy.
I am not a patient person. I hate to wait for anything and everything, and I complain about difficulties with myself and others. I play volleyball on a team at my school. There are a few girls on my team who completely kill my patience. I'm sure the other girls on my team feel the same way. These few girls are pretty cool people, but volleyball is just the best for them. In practice, one of these girls doesn't even try. She is even sad so much herself that she goes shopping for some practices that would ??? his attitude drove me mane. Another girl tries hard enough, but she's boring, controlling, and she thinks she knows absolutely everything there is to know about volleyball. I think she did one on her hand ??? those years of volleyball, and she thinks she can do it every time now. She can rarely be used underground and scream aloud ! This sexy girl, oh my god, I don't even know where to start to know how much of my patience is invested in her. She was probably the bad player on the team, and now that she's broken her pinky, she could be even worse considering she hasn't played in about three weeks. But since she's still on the squad, she goes to all of our games and tears us apart and tries to be cool but fails miserably. It's actually quite funny. Now, I knew these girls had a hard time training, and I know it won't happen overnight. But I guess I'm going to have to put up with them and keep a lot of patients.
Patience is difficult for me. I am just an impatient person. Patience in my life is a rare event, so I will describe a time when I was patient. "@ CAPS1, you can get it this time." I encouraged myself. I have stored on the net. The net was the obstacle. If the net was shorter, I could pass my volleyball serve. I balanced the white ball in the palm of my hand. I lowered my left arm and raised it again quickly, sending the ball high above my head. I pushed my hand forward. Hello ! I hit the ball, but it went for the net. "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3" I think. "You got that!" my whole team looked at me. Clunk, snap. I bounce the ball twice, I spin it once in my hand. I don't even want to look in the crowd. My hand hits the ball. He flies over the net and hits the midfield. As I was patient, @ NUM1 did not give up, I achieved my goal. It taught me one thing. Patience brings victory.
Patience is something you have to work on I don't have much patience, I don't like to wait at all it's not fun. I don't like to wait, because being patient is boring and five @ CAPS2 is twenty @ CAPS2. Then when you wait you start something and then as soon as you start its time. Waiting for the package is the worst. You wait and you sit and wait, then you forgot it and then it comes. One day, I was waiting to go to my friend's house, I had the impression that I had not seen her for ages, but it had only been ten months. I missed her like crazy. We planned this "or weeks it was finally the day to go @ CAPS1. Now I was just waiting for my dad to drive me @ CAPS1 and it takes forever. ? We were expecting five @ CAPS2 ??? Then he gets months ??? and I left. I swear we shopped every red light from my house to the @ CAPS3 house and got hit behind the slowest drivers which made it worse. When we finally got @ CAPS1 I jumped out of the truck, @ PERSON1 walked through the door down then the stars stumbling almost every one. She practically jumped on me while we were kissing for about five @ CAPS2. This is why I am not patient.
My story is about a time when I was patient. One day I was so excited because it was @ CAPS1 and my friends and I were going for a ride or treatment. I was so impatient for the clock to tick @ NUM1 pm because my best friend @ DATE1 was going to pick me up in her pink convertible and we were going for a ride or a treat. I was very impatient because there was only @ NUM2 so I did my chores thinking the time would pass so I did my chores. Instead of putting dish soap in the dishwasher. I put grapes in the dishwasher @ CAPS2 the dish was the hoe was done I emptied it and all the dishes smelled like grapes. So I looked at the clock and it was only @ NUM3 that I remembered my favor movie was on so I ran to my room but instead I ran against the wall and I was knocked out. After @ NUM4 hours I was fine so I told my mom I will be patient because I don't want @ CAPS3 to get hit ??? on the bright side i thought i only had @ NUM5 hours and @ NUM6 minutes to go so i went to my room + lost @ CAPS3.V. until eleven twenty, so I had an hour to get ready to go for a walk or a treatment, but before putting on makeup, I arrived in the kitchen, I put all the dishes that smelled of grapes in the lava -dishes and I washed them properly. Then I put on my costume, I was a bumblebee, then I put on my makeup, I looked so cool. Finally the clock turned to @ NUM1 suddenly I heard a horn @ DATE1 was there. So I got in the car + we went to get cate. I almost forgot to tell you that @ DATE1 was a ladybug, it was a ladybug, so we had a trick or a treat anyway. So this is a time when I was patient.
I remember just a few days ago my mom had to have a tooth checked and guess what I did I read a book! Even though it took forever, I was done with my @ NUM1 minute homework. When my mom came back we got up to leave and my feet were my name. So far, my patience, we have had ice cream. So, you could be rewarded if you are just patient.
I have to admit that there are times when I am not very patient. But I still remember the day I learned about patience. I was @ NUM1 and was going for my annual checkup at the doctor's office. It was around @ NUM2 am a @ DATE1 @ TIME1. I was with my mother in the waiting room when an elderly man entered. He seemed extremely ill and I remember being very scared. The women at the front desk came to see us and told us it would be a wait, @ CAPS1 explained the man was very sick and may die. Mon told me to be patient but I didn't know what that meant so @ CAPS1 explained it to me. @ CAPS1 said, “You should stretch your legs quietly and not complain no matter how long it takes. I told him. I could do it and of course I could. Patience is very important to me. I think it is not just for yourself but for the consideration of others. When you complain about having to wait, it is disrespectful to others. And I know other people are patient for me so I should be patient for them too.
Being patient isn't that hard if you try. It was a @ DATE1 @ TIME1 and I needed help with my math homework but the teacher was helping someone else. So I waited ???. Five minutes later and they still weren't ready, so I decided to skip this issue. Ten minutes later and yet they still weren't done, so I just waited and waited. Then finally they finished ??? was only two minutes. ??? well i guess i will try again and if i still don't get it i will ask tomorrow. So while I was trying to figure it out, it just didn't make sense, so I waited until tomorrow to ask her. So the next day in class I asked her about it and she said we don't have to do this one and I laughed and said ??? understand everything yesterday. This is an example of being patient
One day I spent a night at my best friend's house for @ NUM1 days and ended up going to school with her. Notice that all of my clothes and shoes were still above her house. I couldn't really get my clothes back because right after school I went out to eat. I was really mad because I left my shoes @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 so I called her and told her to bring them to school. The next day I was really looking forward to having them and I comforted her and she said she forgot so I gave her until @ DATE1 and she still hasn't returned them. Notice I was very patient with her and it was the month of @ DATE3. I finally got them back in the month of @ DATE2. Eventually she gave her back and you will never believe that I am still friends with her because my shoes were worn and dirty, but I had to realize that she was a good friend and that I am a patient person.
Once I was patient was when I had to go to the ophthalmologist. I was in a hurry because I was late. It was @ NUM1 and the meeting @ CAPS1 was at @ TIME1. I was at least @ NUM2 minutes from the location. When we got there it was basically @ NUM3 so I missed @ CAPS1's meeting. Had to wait a long time in the waiting room @ CAPS1 mom and had to wait until all the people who had made their appointments were done. We waited at least an hour and a half. As I was patient, I spoke on the phone and went on the Internet. Finally, I listened to music the rest of the time until they called @ CAPS1. In conclusion, it was a time when I was patient.
@ LOCATION1 @ CAPS10 sit down, said my friend. You don't have to move like a fly on the wall. "I sit anxious to get up and move again." @ CAPS1 there are too many people here, we never go in. " I said. The queue was the longest to take my driving test so @ CAPS2 thinking about myself getting up and moving around because I'm not a very patient person. I should be able to move around while I wait, but my friend thinks it's boring and inconvenient. "@ LOCATION1, I wonder if they had an ATM here." “I doubt @ CAPS1,” I proclaim. @ CAPS3 glance at me and I turn away. I got up and left. I came back @ TIME1 and @ CAPS3 was gone I sat and spoke on the phone for a @ CAPS13 @ NUM1 I sat and looked at everyone wandering to talk to because I was bored. I wanted so badly to get up and move around but I watched and @ CAPS10 walked in a circle and more @ CAPS4 to the left. I sat down and waited @ NUM2 @ TIME1 passed and @ CAPS1 approached @ NUM3.m. @ CAPS1 was @ CAPS5 @ NUM4 and I'm @ NUM5 so I knew I was next. "@ CAPS5 @ NUM5 your neighbor." I think in my head like "@ CAPS6". I get up and walk over to the cashier. "@ CAPS7 you for your patience, now @CA PS12 can I help you" I looked at her and said: "@ CAPS8, I would like a driving test please. There hanging like a cazillion of hours. I rethought and think @ CAPS8 @ CAPS11 I was patient @ CAPS1 was probably @ CAPS3 which made me impatient because I had no one to have fun with. So @ CAPS11 @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11. I @ CAPS6 have been patient as always but did @ CAPS13 because I was ready to go. "@ CAPS12 was on hold ? Said the driver's advertising teacher. " @ CAPS13 I felt patient enough to be there for about @ NUM7 hours. This is the moment I never knew but I know I have been patient enough to wait . "
Patience is waiting for something and not complaining about it. When you are patient, you expect something without complaining. If you are waiting for something and start to complain, it means that you don't have a lot of patience. It is not really good not to have patience. Some people just don't have patience at all, and if they don't, it's not good. If you have patience, that's fine, but some people don't and that's not good, because if something you have to wait for and that's important, and you don't patience, it could be bad. Some people have good patience but sometimes even if you have good patience you can still sometimes complain. And that is patience.
One time I had to be present was at the ticking doctor's. The clock was ticking and ticking. It was so boring that we started saying abc forward and backward lessons every time a doctor came out they weren't calling me something that was on @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. Finally after two hours they called me
Oh, one time my mom and I were patient was when we had to sit down and wait for my mom to get her labels because it was her birthday that day. So it all started that morning, we woke up, had our breakfast, took our shower and put on our clothes, our hair. and we brushed our teeth and saved time all about @ NUM1 them after doing everything we lifted and then stayed in our mouth ??? and saved time. all had arrived at @ CAPS1 it was our @ NUM2 and we were both hungry so we stopped at ??? king and that was the day I had to be patient.
Before, when I had to go to the doctor, I had to wait forty minutes. So I just played my @ CAPS1. I was playing Mario Cart. I got on board so I fell asleep. My mom woke me up because it was about time. So we walked in, made my appointment, and went home. Then we had to wait twenty minutes for my dad to come home from work.
Last month I had to go for a root canal. I was very nervous. I arrived at the dentist's office, half scared of the pain, there were two people in front of me so I had to wait, which scared me even more. It was time for me to go to the dentist. I have been patient the whole time. After that I was fine, it didn't even hurt. When I got home I fell asleep, I woke up in pain, my tooth was on fire. I never complained though, and when my mom tried to hurry and my meds, I never yelled at her to hurry or cried. It was the moment when I was patient.
This story tells of how I waited patiently while I waited for my birthday in three days. I have been patient in wanting to see what I get for my birthday even though it really bothers me! Plus, I've been patient because I'm spending a slumber party with all of my close friends. Looks like it takes forever. At my slumber party there will be cake and ice cream ! "@ CAPS1 !" I have also been patient because I am twelve years old, which means I will be patient. Then the day after my sleepover, my mom, my brother and I go to the mall and then to the movies and I have a hundred dollars to spend. At the mall! It is very difficult to be patient to do fun things. Finally, I was patient in not asking everyone if they were coming. Some girls forget to ask their parents and it bothers me because there are only two days left. This story showed how patient I waited for my birthday in three days! But you have to be patient to do the fun things that I've learned recently.
When I was little we went to @ ORGANIZATION1. I was finally old enough to go on the last @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2! When we walked to the line, we noticed how many people were there. The line looked like it was five miles long! My mom asked me if I wanted to continue in the queue or go next time when it was less crowded. This is what I expected! I was not oppernutity. I told him I wanted to continue so we continued to walk. It took what seemed like two days to reach the top. My mom and I were so patient! So we waited and waited and waited. Until we are finally at the top. Then we went down. It was worth the wait! we have been so patient. I will always remember all the fun I had that day and the great achievement. I didn't know I could be so patient and that my mom and I could wait so long.
Buzz Buzz! @ CAPS8 I hear "@ CAPS1 your phone is @ CAPS2." so i got up and checked @ NUM1 missed calls. I'm looking at who they're coming from at @ NUM2 all of @ CAPS6 daddy. I sensed that something was wrong. Called him back and heard “@ CAPS1 get ready grandma @ CAPS4 I'm coming to pick you up. “ I said it was @ NUM3 @ CAPS5, are you crazy ? ” At that point, i was in a family member's house @ CAPS8 @ CAPS6 dad said “@ PERSON2 had a bad crush.” @ CAPS6 heart drop and started to cry. gather your things and I will call you back with more info. I hung up on the phone @ CAPS6 aunt was up, she walked into the room, I told her what I know. I was collecting stuff @ CAPS6, try not to wake anyone else. When I was waiting for the call, it all happened in @ CAPS6's mind. I was with him, what happened, are you okay, will you he die? @ CAPS8 I heard a beep, I said goodbye and ran out. Running made me think: how hurt is he, what was he driving , what was he doing outside I got in the car, I asked @ CAPS6 grandma in read i asking where is mom, where is @ LOCATION1, where is @ CAPS7 are they okay when am i going to see it? All I knew was patience. @ CAPS8 I got the call I asked @ CAPS6 daddy "What happened what he hit who called @ NUM4 where are we going?" the first thing that came out of @ CAPS6's dads mouths was "calm down i can't go home but @ PERSON1 will be there i want you to stay with him ok" yes dad i will and daddy "I said" you, "he said back. I said I love you." "I love you too" he said. The worst time in @ CAPS6's life awaited @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 were @ CAPS6's dads when @ CAPS6's daddy was not at home. I know I would be fine with @ PERSON1. How will he act when he sees his best friend like this? @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 are firefighters. I wonder if they knew who helped @ PERSON2. I knew he was always there for me. The wait was close at hand, but I had to be patient. I remember closing @ CAPS6's eyes and wish it was a dream. Now I can walk into @ PERSON1 right behind me walking it looks like all the glass on him @ CAPS8 dayna said look who's here he opened his eyes they got really big when they saw me . @ CAPS8 @ PERSON2 said @ PERSON1 come here "@ PERSON1 is gone. @ PERSON2 said 'thank you for taking care of @ CAPS6 little sister, I love you man.' It was around this time in @ CAPS6's life that I had to be patient to see @ CAPS6's brother, I didn't care how he looked as long as he was okay.
There is this little patience that I use a lot come on I called it the hunting patience. On @ DATE1, my dad and I were hunting at @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS1. we walked into our stalls cooking over a bean field from @ NUM1, and not @ NUM2 hours later two walked in from our left, they were approaching @ CAPS2. I was about to draw my bow when I looked around and saw my dad waiting for @ CAPS2 to shoot, but when I looked in the forest corner of our field I saw a big six-point male that didn't move. I decided to be patient and see if the male would come in. I saw a deer move in my blind spot where I couldn't see it, I thought it could also go like this buck last year in my blind spot. I waited @ NUM3 minutes, just when I thought he was gone I saw him come again just for us. It was at @ NUM4 then @ NUM5 then @ NUM6 and stopped. I looked at my father and nodded to give him a signal to shoot. He realized he drew his bow and let that arrow fly. The arrow is engulfed in the deer and at this moment I know that by dint of patience we will eat well this evening with a party to honor the good days of hunting.
It was a sunny day and I was playing with my doe. Finally I finished doing my tour it took an hour of repair. I got started with astonishment. I was proud, very proud of myself. I took out a piece of doe and made it in the "@ CAPS1" I put it on the top of the tower. Well my five minutes of wonder was coming to an end @ CAPS2 ! I look up to see that my tower was in ruins. I look ahead and see my brother. I told him why he did it because it's fun. I told him it was fun for you but not for me. It took me an hour to finish it, good thing I was patient. He looked down and said @ CAPS3 sorry for what I did. I told him, and if we rebuilt it, but even better. He agreed and we both got to work. See how important patience is, the problem could have gotten worse. The end.
Once in the @ NUM1 class, my teacher @ PERSON1 "asked us to release an AMP". @ CAPS1 we all did it and quietly started to work. All of a sudden I was on my last prebblem and I was thinking "man already till the end". @ CAPS1 I started working on it, I was @ CAPS1 confused, this problem looked like a seventh grade job. @ CAPS1 I raised my hand and waited to continue @ PERSON1 my hand and told me to continue my math but I said "I can't continue, I'm on my last problem." @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1 continued to help all the other students and I was waiting and waiting. Finally, after going to see eight other people, she came to help me. She showed me how to fix the problem and I found it. This is the moment when I waited patiently.
Well one day I saw an ad on the super xbox @ NUM1. The ad said it would be out in @ NUM2 weeks. @ NUM2 weeks “ I thought it was going to take forever so I waited and waited and waited. I glanced at the clock. He said @ NUM4, "I said," @ CAPS1 has only been @ NUM5 minutes. So I started playing a game and forgot the xbox @ NUM1. My dad said we were going shopping to get my x-box. I'm like, wow did he miss it. I guess if you don't think about it and aren't patient, it'll be over in no time.
One day my sister organized a volleyball tournament. It lasts all day. I just got there the worst time and beware for ????????. I can't complain or I'll be in trouble, I just need to be patient. I am very patient now because she has a lot of tournaments. When is my usual mom finally finished ?? me for being good all the time. As you can see, being patient is difficult, but it is a very important trait to have.
This is my story about patience. I go to the doctor every @ NUM1 months. Me, my brothers and my sister and it takes about @ NUM2 to @ NUM3 hours. When the doctor asks my brothers questions when he says then I'm already figuring out my answer and then it's my turn, but before my turn @ NUM4 sce the doctor I was really patient. Then it took doctor @ NUM5 minutes for my turn to be over. Then he has to talk to my mother who comes my time with them. When we do it to the doctor or dentist, we are really patient, but it takes time for the doctor or dentist to do what they need to do.
Once the @ DATE1 break up my family and I went to @ LOCATION1. While we were at @ LOCATION1 we went to a huge water park. My two sisters and I convinced my parents to go. A few days later we went to the water park. We rented a locker, changed our clothes and started looking for slides. Just as we entered there was a huge sunken ship. On the ziplines to where! We all ran to the ship and realized there was a queue. Not a short line. A giant line. We had to be there at NUM1 minute wait. Finally, it was my turn. I grabbed the handle and lifted off the ground. I had almost reached the end when it slowed to a stop. I let go when I fell into a swimming pool. The wait was well worth it!
"Patience is a virtue." You might hear this phrase a lot if you don't like to wait for things for a long time. Here is a question for my audience, what is patience ? Do you know Well, in my essay I'm going to discuss patience and how it affects our lives. These days it is very difficult to meet someone with a good dose of patience. Due to all the " @ CAPS1 " services and products such as delivering pizza to NUM1 minutes of washing and cleaning, people started to lose patience. What our generation has yet to realize is that we need this patience to get good jobs and to get good sums of money. Another reason people need patience is their families. If you lack patience, you will not be able to deal with young and immature family members. For example, I don't have any patience so I can't deal with people under @ NUM1 years old. It will affect me in a very negative way. These are the pros and cons of having patience, thanks for reading my essay.
Once when I was patient, that's when I was a little kid and my mother said we were going up to visit my cousins in CAPS1 @ @ CAPS2. I was just a little kid so I was very excited to take my first plane ride. When we finally got to @ LOCATION1 I was so excited. I asked my mom when we got to the hotel can I go swimming. She told me to just be patient. So when we got to the hotel I was patient as long as I could, so I couldn't wait any longer. So I put on my underwear and went swimming with my cousin. And that was a time when I was patient for something.
I will write during a time when I was patient. My family and I went to Ceder Point. and it was this ride called the @ CAPS1 the best and tallest rollercoaster to cede point. So we stood in line, it was so long that we had to wait @ NUM1 to get on, because the line was so long. So I had my uncle who hadn't come up on the ride to get me soft drinks, elephant ears and chips because I was so hungry and thirsty. So while I was patient, my other family was not very patient. I was the only patient. So @ NUM2 passed, we are still online, my family started to get restless. @ NUM3 hours later they were getting crazier and crazier. Then at NUM4 hours we would start to see the roller coaster and people going up and down. So finally, we got on board, we had a great time. Then I had to explain how patient I was. And how much they weren't patient.
One day there was a man who was not patient at all. He thought that whatever he wanted would come to him immediately. His name was @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 quickly realized that not everything was going well when he wanted it to. So he got really angry when he saw a house for sale, it was a very nice house. But the people living in the house had not finished moving everything out of the house. Then he discovered that patience is the key and that when it is time to move in, he will. So from that point on he was always patient for the rest of his life.
It was a time when I was patient. It was a @ DATE1 @ TIME1 the day I was born, we had @ NUM1 boys in my house. We all wanted to play Xbox. (@ ORGANIZATION1.core @ NUM2). Only have @ NUM3 controllers. So now you have the rule, let your geus no post ! They all played ??. @ NUM4 minutes ! I had to ?? minutes to play my own game ! @ MONTH1 all my ?? lucky i was patient. I hated sitting there it made me angry and after a while they didn't ?? play.so I asked my friends @ CAPS1 and @ PERSON1 if they would play ?? with me. They said yes after waiting @ NUM5 minutes and then no one wanted to play anymore. It made me feel pretty bad! It was my birthday, can't you play a bit ??. I felt good, I remained patient and I did not go bisunck. It was a time when I was patient.
The clock is ticking, waiting, ready, ready to burst into ???. Never before @ CAPS1, @ NUM1 is planted blank @ ORGANIZATION1, patience is key because with this @ CAPS1, anyone who tries to defuse this @ CAPS1 except at the last minute of the countdown until some destruction on the will detonate explosively. The alpha @ NUM2 @ CAPS1 says wait, wait for the right time. @ NUM3 minutes remaining, @ NUM4 minutes remaining, @ NUM5 minutes remaining, @ NUM6 minutes. "@ CAPS2, @ CAPS2 !" shouted @ PERSON1, the leader of the rescued. This is our only chance to save white @ ORGANIZATION1. Time is running out, @ NUM7 seconds of pole preggrare on our shoulders, the fate of white @ ORGANIZATION1 is on our side. The enemies call in fantry, just as all the honey is wasted, "I got it!" I exclaimed. All that was left was ??? and let the military do the work. We rushed towards the van with our shields out and smashed into the defenses. Suddenly we heard a loud noise and we noticed and loaded on the bottom of the van, we ran for our white life our night van exploded to pieces right behind us. We live patiently while waiting for the patrol to pass. We just needed to cross the field to the army hetiepter and we were free to go home. We are sprinting on the field and the victory is ours. A feeling of accomplishment and grandeur crosses me.
It was @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I was watching tv while waiting @ CAPS1 and I was patient and not sulky because I wanted @ LOCATION1 to come to my place and, they were playing tv shows @ CAPS1 and it made me so excited and I felt like my healing was about to break out, but I was patient. Then my mom said it was time to go to bed so me because I wanted @ LOCATION1 to come to my place. But the only problem was I couldn't sleep so I went and got a glass of water and turned the tv on softly and on the acid I fell asleep on the couch and the next thing I did I learned it was @ CAPS1 and it happened so fast it was like it was @ CAPS1 in @ NUM1 minutes. Because I have been patient.
I have been patient many times here are a few. First, I was patient for my friend. I am patient with him because we were going to walk to school. He told me a minute, but it was more like twenty. We have barely reached the first hour. Another way to be patient was when my mom and I picked up my new shoes from @ ORGANIZATION1. When my mom and I were waiting, the man from the store went to get the shoes. The man came back there and took about half an hour. But it was worth it for my new shoes. These are just a few of the ways I have been patient.
Patience is like waiting for something and not getting upset. Imagine if no one had patience, everything would suck. Imagine you are at the store, there is a queue at the checkout, no patience and people are fighting to get to it. Knowing that most people have patience, this would not happen. Since people have patience, the world is in order, so if you think about it, that's a good thing.
A time when I was patient was on the city bus. So my mom and I could go to Walmart. We waited @ NUM1 hours until we arrived. Before getting on we had to pay a @ MONEY1 each. Then ask for the transfer very kindly. Then get on another bus and then get off and go shopping. Then wait for the bus to come back and get home after @ NUM1 hours. Then take the bus around the corner and walk back to the house.
Right before @ DATE2's break, in fourth grade, there was a @ CAPS1 party at my neighbor's house. My parents and I were invited, and since we had nothing planned, we decided to go to the party. The party was spectacular! There were stockings hanging over the fireplace, green and red streamers everywhere, and a huge @ CAPS1 tree in the living room. Under the @ CAPS1 tree was a big pile of gifts, each for the kids. My neighbor saw me looking at the presents, so he walked over, picked up a present and handed it to me. The gift was a rectangular shape wrapped in blue wrapping paper decorated with snowflakes. On the front was my name in marker. I was about to open my present when my neighbor told me to wait. He said if I opened it now I would only have one gift. If I waited until the morning of @ CAPS1 to open it, I would receive two gifts. I didn't understand him at first, but he said I would figure it out soon. @ CAPS1 was in a week ! How the hell was I supposed to wait until then? Of course, I wanted two presents, so I told my neighbor I would wait. But deep down inside, I wanted to tear up the present right away. The days dragged on. Why was the week going so slowly? As @ CAPS1 approached, I grew impatient. I almost opened my gift three days before @ CAPS1. Finally, on the 25th of @ DATE1, I was able to open my gift. Instead of quickly unwrapping it as I planned, I slowly tore off the paper… and found a pretty velvet journal with golden boarders. Inside was a note : @ CAPS7 only you won a new journal, now you have the gift of patience. Now I understand.
This was the time when I was patient. One day @ DATE1 when I was playing my game @ CAPS1 @ NUM1, I told my mom I wanted a new game because my games were a bit old. My mom said "@ CAPS3 honey be patient" I was patient for a month. My brother asked my mom for a new game and he got it the next day. My sister wanted a curling machine that she had made it for. So I wait and I have also been patient. My dad came back from @ LOCATION1, and I asked him. I said, "Daddy, can you get me a new game @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 ?" "@ CAPS3 honey but I can't have it now. You just have to be patient." " Ugh okay ! " I cried after my father had already achieved what my brother and my sister wanted, and I was the only one that my father and my mother had never even got my game. So I waited , and I waited for my dad to take me to the video store. I was so happy even though my sister and brother got what they wanted. I still have my game. Waiting isn't that hard, it just takes patience. This is how patience helps you achieve what you want.
To me, patience means you are willing to wait a long time to get something done. I was a little patient when I got delayed at an airport and then canceled it wasn't much fun as I didn't eat in the afternoon. But I was happy because I had my DS. The story was that we went to @ LOCATION1 on the @ NUM1 for a vacation to Disney Land. It was snowing when we got to the airport. We had to hurry through the line of control and security. When we got to the boarding gate, we looked for where we should board. I saw that our flight had been delayed and we had to stay here at the airport. I at least saw that we were going to the new @ LOCATION2 first and then to @ LOCATION1 but I was patient. Well, this is the day when I was very, very patient.
I was patient for @ DATE1 @ CAPS1 @ DATE1 present. It was almost @ DATE1 @ CAPS1 @ DATE1 and I kept asking for gifts @ DATE1, but @ DATE1 mom kept saying no. it was getting closer and closer and i kept asking, until @ DATE1 mom said be patient you will get them dont worry but of course i had a hard time being patient. Final was @ DATE1 and I couldn't wait but had to. @ DATE1 I went to my bed, I asked again and she still said no. The @ DATE1 came and I went to school. I was so happy because today was @ DATE1 @ DATE1 and got gifts at @ DATE1, came home and @ DATE1 mom was waiting with a cake and a gift she said "there is more". That was the reason I was trying to be patient.
@ CAPS2 was a dark sad night we went to get a metro for my family. Boom, love at first sight @ CAPS1 everything has darkened. The nursery came out to everyone to be calm and used navy blue flashlights which we could not reach our car because @ CAPS2 was raining and rumbling so loud we were afraid we would be shocked. So we waited to growl, when my stomach " I'm hungry " then my grandmother and I asked if we could still have our subs prepared because we have light. The nursery said "okay". She told the worker to go back to work. @ NUM1 min later the nursery started giving out chips, sodas and cookies to the subs @ CAPS2 was @ NUM2 pm. We all ate and fell asleep. We all woke up the next morning with lights on. So we all got out to our cars, smelling the break and the meat. It was the best patient day of my life.
I ride a beautiful paint horse named @ CAPS1, she has one blue eye and one brown eye. One side of it is completely with and the other side has brown spots. @ CAPS1 is a plump horse, and she loves treats! When I nail her, she knows she'll get some treats, but she has to wait until I put her on the bridle, and until she takes her piece, then she can have her treat. As I am a new rider I make mistakes quite frequently so @ CAPS1 must be patient with me when riding her. When I make mistakes or upset @ CAPS1, she is patient most of the time. I'm doing my best, just like @ CAPS1, but I'm far from the perfect runner, so @ CAPS1 has to support me. After @ CAPS1 and I'm done rolling I untie it and brush, once I'm done my instructor tells me to give @ CAPS1 a treat. @ CAPS1 watched me walk into the long stall role and patiently waits for me to return with her treat. Once she was done with her treat, I let her out into the paddock to play with her friends. @ CAPS1 then ran to his friends, a glass of water, and doesn't have to wait for a while.
One time I had to be patient was when we went to @ LOCATION2. It was a @ NUM1 hour flight with a two hour stopover at @ LOCATION1. It was really hard for me to be patient as I really wanted to go to @ LOCATION2. During the layover to pass the time, I listened to my ipod and used my macbook pro to access Facebook. It really helped me to be patient as it took the mind of @ LOCATION2 out of me and we were at @ LOCATION2 in real time, and when we got there my patient got paid because I was able to swim on beaches and partying I @ LOCATION2 for @ DATE1 break @ DATE2 this is my story about a time when I was patient.
There were @ NUM1 girls and over there mom was gay and she took them to the motel for the middle kid's birthday. They were all good units, girlfried cathy moms and my @ CAPS1 mom went out to get some gifts for @ CAPS2 so it was the nicest @ CAPS3 middle @ CAPS2 baby meme. Well they went and left @ CAPS4 and the girls at the motel. They came back @ NUM2 later. So @ CAPS1 was coming back to pick us up and I noticed she wasn't in the van so I started to cry when she told one that cahty had been taken to jail and we didn't money, no we had no one left so we had to go to that gas station and my sister and I were sitting on the sidewalk and my mom crossed the street on the bus on the payphone. We had to wait patiently in the cold of winter. Until @ NUM3 some really cool ladies saw us sitting on the cold and this show I moved to Bangor from Southhaven.
Once I was a patient, I waited at the hospital. My grandmother once went to the hospital because she had passed out and was not breathing. When we got to the hospital, we couldn't see her for a long time. My mother, my brother, my cousins, my uncle were sitting there waiting very patiently. The next day we still couldn't see her, which was sad and scary. My uncle took us to get something to eat while my mother was in the hospital. When we got back to the hospital, my mother was very upset because we couldn't see her at all. The doctor came out and said we could see her. When we entered the room, she was sitting smiling. My mom told her it took us forever to see you. My grandmother scud the doctor said it was okay. We were in the hospital for about @ NUM1 more hours then left but my mom stayed. In conclusion, I told you when I was a patient in the hospital. Even though we wanted to run but didn't and we stayed very calm. This is the time when I was patient.
Being patient is a good thing. Sometimes impatient @ CAPS1 sometimes I'm no better to be patient. My cousin is patient so when I tell her to wait and be patient, she will wait as long as she wants. My other parents tell me to be patient and I'll just wait a while and I ask then hurry up and they tell me to learn to be patient. My cousin was trying to teach me to be patient and we tried. So now I can stay longer by being patient.
I was in class waiting for me to know this would happen soon. It was almost time, but I was still waiting for the end of the first class. It was math. Personally, I wasn't too keen on math so unfortunately I had to wait. @ NUM1 more minutes and I was home free. The time had come and I was happy. @ PERSON1 said "@ CAPS1 your file away" @ CAPS2 ! I @ CAPS1 faster than I can say supercal fraja list expeal & docinus. So in his voice he said "You @ MONTH1 is going to lunch" I hurried up and was going to be the first one there, I almost thought I wasn't patient enough but I was. I booked it with me for free. When I saw a figure in front of me. "no" I say. I was defeated by a girl! I was devastated that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
When most people think of patience, they think of waiting. But that's only half. Patience waits without complaint, like when I went to @ ORGANIZATION1. It was about a five hour drive. I know this doesn't sound like much, but I @ CAPS1 corridor. I come from the @ CAPS1 outright. But my brother and I didn't complain, mainly because the knight before our mom said two of them were good to complain about sitting with her in the hotel room all the time. Isn't that scary ”, so we finally went. It's been a fun week, we ate great food, played sweet games and didn't go to a great museum . But on the way back it was another test of patience, especially since we had an accident.
At @ DATE1 my dad took a business trip to @ CAPS1 dinsney land. We went to the park and did a few rides. My dad had to leave for a meeting, so he did. After a while I saw something cool, the @ CAPS2 space. I stood in line and saw a sign, @ NUM1 hours until take off ! My mom was shocked so we left. I was so disappointed. We came back the next day and the wait was @ NUM2 hours. We stood in line and waited and waited and waited. After @ NUM3 minutes, I was bored. I asked my mom if we could leave, but the line was too long to go out. After hours that seemed like years, we arrived at the front line, but my sister wanted to leave! My mom crossed the line and so did my sister, but I'm staying. I waited on my own for @ NUM4 minutes when I rode the roller coaster ! It was fun and I got a fastoa for @ NUM5 other rides ! In the end, my patience paid off.
It was late @ DATE1 when my @ CAPS1 is and I was going to point @ CAPS2 for my @ CAPS1. So we took forever to drive over there, sitting in the back, sent out there on our own, no one to talk to except my phone. So we finally get there by wasting all of my patients in the car after getting in, we go on the @ CAPS4 @ NUM1 @ CAPS5 wait to make a @ NUM1 minute ride it's worth it but @ NUM1 hours c ' is time consuming. So I wait and then we get off the route, we go on the line @ CAPS6 @ NUM4 @ CAPS5 for @ NUM5 second route. All trips there - down lasted at least 1 to NUM1 hours. With the exception of one ride with the @ CAPS7, we got there before the crowds arrived . So that was on the @ NUM7 minute step and @ CAPS8 the time we got on the way up and at the top of the hill it was probably a @ CAPS5 line. So, we really lucked out on that one. But @ CAPS8 by the time the park closed and we got to our car there was a huge traffic jam and it was all the patients that had left so we were in line to leave the park for another @ CAPS5 and half so we waited and waited and finally he moved and once we got to the park and get out of the road we had to take was closed due to a car accident we had to talk about this huge detoer who added a @ CAPS5 to our time because of the traffic taking this way and @ CAPS8 by the time we got to our hotel I didn't have a drop of patients left I felt like I was going explode but I didn't I acted very patient but it was a good thing I have a lot of patients.
One time I was patient was when I went to point @ CAPS1 with family @ CAPS6 and friend @ CAPS6 @ LOCATION1. We did a few rides, then @ CAPS6's sister said " can we do the @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 again ?" " I replied" of course, even though it was the fifth time we had made the trip. @ CAPS6 sister and I went to line up for the ride. I said "we should ride in the first row". @ CAPS4 said "we should". @ CAPS5, we went to the first row and the queue was packed. @ CAPS5 we waited twenty minutes or @ CAPS5 when someone threw up on another cart. The employees had to clean up the vomit, which took another twenty minutes. @ CAPS5, we kept waiting and waiting until they let us in. After the ride I exclaimed " who would throw up on a ride like @ CAPS7 ", @ CAPS6's dad replied " I don't know ". The @ CAPS7 day is a day that I remember @ CAPS6's patience because I waited forty to sixty minutes for a ride not worth the wait. What was worth the wait was seeing the smile on sister @ CAPS6's face and her laughter.
I know many patient people, and have had many experiences that have to do with patience. My friend, @ PERSON1, is usually impatient. Every time she waits for something, she texts me saying, "@ CAPS1 !" or, "@ CAPS2 onnn!" @ CAPS3 one day she was actually very patient. My family, @ PERSON1, and I were going to the one @ DATE1 @ TIME1 zoo. We brought snacks and packed everything the day before. We were going to look for @ PERSON1 at her place and @ CAPS3 to go to the zoo. But my mom slept and still had to take a shower! She said we were going to look for @ PERSON1 on the way from the zoo to @ NUM1 am, and he was already @ NUM2 am. We were late and I thought @ PERSON1 was going to get mad. Fortunately, @ PERSON1 wasn't crazy ! She was understanding and said she was okay. Usually she would say something like, “@ CAPS4, where are you? Why are you taking so long? @ CAPS5 times, she hasn't said any of this. We ended up going to the zoo around noon, but it was all fun and joyful! I have had experiences with many patient people and the @ CAPS5 experience has been fun !
I think patience is all about waiting for something you wanted or didn't want to happen. Sometimes it hits without being inspected. Especially at the point of cedar, you need a lot of patience. Beep! Beep! I hit my alarm clock with all my might so I hope the thing goes out. Butt @ DATE1 I was going to cedar point and can't wait. So I got up, took a shower, and had breakfast which was great. My mom made blueberry mudins. I had my whole pack a week earlier because I was so excited. I put my clothes in the car and my brother, my sister, my mother, my fathers so that we can get there faster. The car ride was not that easy as it was three hours but we had a tv in our cars so it didn't take as long as usual as they were busy so it's like a commute. shorter car for my brother sister and me. When we entered the howtell it was awesome because it was like @ NUM1 stories high. And we also had to use the elevator to get to our upstairs room @ NUM2. My sister was amazed at all the stuffed animals and was waiting to buy the furry things but couldn't. My mom woke us up on the open rides in about @ NUM3 minutes, here we are. So I rushed out of bed running like I had a fire in my ass trying to find my clothes. So I found all my clothes and ran to get my shoes from across the bed. So by the time we were all dressed and taking a shower the rides had been going on for an hour so we walked to the gate and got the one ride called a million ofcare. Sigh said @ NUM4 hours of wait sorry the ride is just beginning due to difficulties with seat belts and other technical issues sorry. So my mom said to wait here to go up, it's really fun. So I waited and waited, I have no more patience. I'll buy you a hot dog after that so I did and it was a terrific NUM1 hour ride to the park. It was fun but we had to go tomorrow. And I had my hot dog. It was my story to be cedar point patient when all you wanted to do was have fun. Sometimes you have to be skated to get what you want.
One hot day @ DATE1 my family and I went to @ ORGANIZATION1. There was a new roundabout open called shoot the rapids. It was a large brown merry-go-round with a tunnel and two hills. As we approached to see how long the wait was, it said @ NUM1 wait hour. We all really wanted to go so we decided to wait. When we got in line it was about @ NUM2 outside, we were all sweaty. And to make matters worse, there was this annoying little boy talking to me about food or something. It was really boring. We were about halfway down the line when my nerves kicked in. I was really scared, but I knew I had to be brave and aspire. About @ NUM3. Later we were @ NUM4 people away from the ride. My heart was racing, my knees were shaking. I thought I was going to die. Then all of a sudden it broke down. We had to wait for another @ NUM5. Over time, we finally got on the water. I regret that. I cried and cried but I'm happy. I did not cheat. It was a time when I had patience and I regret it.
I once had to be very patient when my grandmother told me there was something in the mail for me. I was so excited. I waited and waited but nothing came up. Then I started to lose my patience. My grandma said "@ CAPS1 keep waiting, it will come soon". So I did what my grandmother told me and the next day a big package arrived. I was so happy he was finally here. My uncle had sent all my sisters and I new sneakers. Plus we all have @ NUM1 players. I was so happy that my patience was finally worth it.
One day when I was in third grade @ DATE1. My mom was driving me to school and she said, "When I come to pick you up today, I have a surprise for you to know how." @ CAPS1 all day long I had to be patient but I couldn't, I just had to come home to see what it was. I could have pretended I was sick and went home but decided to calm down and be patient. I said to myself on school day. It will be over soon. At @ NUM1, I left school and my mom picked me up. I told her I was @ CAPS1 excited to see what she had for me, but told her I was patient all school day ! Finally we got there and she told me to "go to my room" I said "ok" when I walked in I saw a cute little black puppy I was soon happy to have a dog! I said thank you mom thank you very much dad I end by naming her chioe.
Being patient is a very hard and difficult thing to do sometimes, but we have to endure it. Being the patient usually pays off. We were on our way to the airport and my two younger brothers and I were eager to get to @ LOCATION1. We arrived at the airport thinking we would get straight on the plane. But when we got there we found out that we had to wait @ NUM1 hours until the plane left and would be on our way to @ LOCATION1. So we decided to play our games that we had brought with us. We were very patient. Finally, it was time for us to get on the plane. We walked through the long tube that leads to the door of the plane. We sat in our seats, strapped in and ready for take off. We heard the pilot talking through loudspeakers "I am so sorry, but there is a severe thunderstorm appearing on the radar, we @ MONTH1 do not continue until it clears up." @ CAPS1 !? " @ CAPS2 Will it take a long time ? My mother asked. About five hours, ”she said. Good thing we brought our @ CAPS3 reader so that it will hold us back for about two hours. For the rest of the time, I played, slept, and just waited patiently. The flight attendant came to see us and told us that since we were very patient during the five hours, even my three year old brother, she would reward us with five @ ORGANIZATION1 Global Pass tickets for my family. In conclusion, when you are patient, it doesn't matter @ CAPS2 you might be rewarded just like my family.
The patient is a big thing. It means being understanding and calm. Sometimes people can endure hardship and pain and still be calm. Whenever your brother or sister annoys you, your back is always patient and never small. "@ CAPS1 !" @ CAPS2 already in place !! "@ CAPS3 my brother." @ CAPS4 I'm awake! “ I screamed. I took a huge gulp of air and let her out with a sigh. “ I am so high ! My brother yelled in my face, " can we @ CAPS13 walk " I was counting over ten hours in my head, then I finally spoke " @ CAPS7 ". I removed my coat from the rack followed by the little brother. We went out just when we saw my mom coming over to give meachore. “ You will have to cut the grass today and rake the leaves. "@ CAPS5 calmly said" @ CAPS6 you are taking your little brother for a walk ". "@ CAPS7", I was completely pissed off @ CAPS12 on the inside. I tried to keep my cool, but it didn't last long, "@ CAPS8 @ CAPS9!" My brother's friend said fully applaud, "Can you come and play?" @ CAPS10 asked him, my brother looked up at me and I closed my eyes usually bursting out. “I stuttered on my way home. I grabbed the learning mower and just as I was about to turn it @ CAPS12 - "@ CAPS11, come in and start your home job... So you can't down!" " One. Two. . There… "I counted in silence. I walked with a fake smile @ CAPS12 my face. @ CAPS12 on the other hand… @ CAPS13 take out the trash ! " " 175 ...! I continued to count. I went down the stairs, I grabbed the trash and walked to the trash when I let down the age of the clothes in inside. I was trying to put myself in a happy place - @ CAPS1 ! I sped up inside to look @ CAPS24 had happened, it turned out my sister broke my x box @ CAPS12 les tites because @ CAPS5 wanted to play. If I pass @ NUM1 counting in my brain, I go to @ CAPS15 ! I was thinking. I held my little sister and gave her to my mom. @ CAPS5 broke my box x ! "I repeated" @ CAPS17 @ CAPS7, your dat will correct it. "@ CAPS5 said calmly" @ CAPS19 @ CAPS13 take your brother ", " @ CAPS4 ... "I rushed to the friend's house of my brothers and I told him I had to look for my brother. "@ CAPS7"… @ CAPS22 ! @ CAPS10 shouted " your brother is here to have you ". "@ CAPS23 !" I urged to stay silent and patient and I got there. got home and threw myself into my bed @ CAPS12. "@ CAPS24 one day borins !" I talked to myself. "I don't think I'll be that patient in my life again !! And I hit my head @ CAPS12 on the pillow and said" @ CAPS25 @ CAPS26 ! "And went to bed. Wow! @ CAPS24 per day ! Patience means being understanding and calm. Great patience. I have tried and learned a powerful lesson, always try. My life is much better @ CAPS19 I try to be patient and never hit my brother or sister even though they sometimes make me @ NUM2 angry. The @ CAPS26 would be better if everyone was patient, people have to try checeed, that's a very, very famous phrase.
It's like when you wait in a line, it's patience. Or like when you keep raising your hand, the tech keeps saying do your job and you do it a gen, she will say, if you are that age you will go to the chickroom. It is then that a teacher loses patience.
I write about a time when I was patient. The time I was patient was when it was the first week of football. We went into town to take the metro before the game and had a teddy bear. I was the first in line but then I was followed by other people. Only one cut me off at the start, but then others followed and I became the last in the line, it was like an hour in a row! Finally, I was next, I had my sub. There was turkey, lettuce, pickles, bananas, pepper, cucumbers and superb French spinach. It won something in that line, being patient really pays off and back. It had been over @ NUM1 minutes. I sigh in relief. We were pumped up for our first games, we played at the start, but we matched it, but it was still a great day !
When I was ... Once after school, I walked home with my friends from school. @ CAPS3 knowing me, wanted something to eat @ CAPS3 I told my friends to come to rest from @ LOCATION1 (it's a fast food restaurant.) @ CAPS1 we are walking into @ LOCATION1, the place is crowded @ CAPS3 I stood in line after about @ NUM1 minutes my friends said "@ CAPS2 man let's go" @ CAPS3 I said " meet you outside" " ok" they said. A fight @ NUM2 minites later it was my turn to order and I order a double stack and some fries and I got free milkshake for my patience she asked what kind did @ CAPS4 I got her said strawberry and i didnt have to pay for ?? ? was totally free and i went out and told my friends i got this for free and then they said "oooooooh" that's when we got home.
About @ NUM1 weeks ago I ordered a series of borderline looks online, had to be very patient to feel like I was waiting @ NUM2 years. This book series was not like any @ CAPS1 book series The books are my favorite book, they are called the @ LOCATION1 series. I have read the @ NUM1 series times and still read them. But, I had to wait to get them. I tried to be patient, but it was hard. The dispatch date was announced in less than @ NUM4 hours. I had to wait @ NUM5 day before it arrived, when I forget them they come! Being patient is a good quality that people can have. So if your patient you will probably get what you want.
Once I was patient, I took my first @ CAPS1 test this year. The test was not too hard, but not easy. I finished it with about an hour and a half. For an hour and a half, I had nothing to do except stay perfectly still and silent. Staying still and silent for five minutes is hard for a @ NUM1 year old child, imagine @ NUM2 minutes ! At first I was moving, then my neck started to hurt, so I lay my head down. I closed my eyes and lay there, perfectly still and still. Quite quickly the time passed and the @ CAPS2.EAP was done (done for the day). I was very proud to have been patient and calm during these @ NUM2 minutes.
Hello, my name is @ PERSON1 and I am going to tell you a story about the patience I once showed. I remember when I was patient. It was the day of chismis. There were tons and tons of precidens under the tree. There were very small to the largest. But I couldn't even watch them because my mom and dad still weren't up. I wanted to go to my mom and dad's room and wake them up. But not without a breakfast in bed, so when I wake them up they can hurry up and eat so they can open my precidens. After my mom and dad finished eating, I was finally able to open my previous ones.
The patient is when you are tolerant and understanding. A lot of people @ CAPS4 don't have the patience, while others do. I'm kinda in the middle, but here's a point where I had to be very patient. It was a bright and sunny @ DATE2 @ TIME1. The sun was shining like there was no tomorrow. Too bad I can't play outside. I was too busy relaxing, eating popcorn, and watching a big event. It might give me bragging rights, I guess I need hope and patience. "@ CAPS1" my brother shouted happily and in my face. "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS2 loser, lions win and steelers lose," he added. "@ CAPS4 is not happy, there is still plenty of time." I replied, a worried look on my face. I was afraid of losing, but taking my brother deeply I was very patient. The clock stops. It was the being of @ DATE1. The score was @ NUM1 to @ NUM2, the lions lead. I was still a little worried, but I never gave up hope. As the game drew to a close, the @ DATE1 back for the steepless gave an assist and @ CAPS1 I screamed while dancing and jumping. I said to my brother, ' who's the loser now, eh ? "Wow, all it took was patience and hope," I thought to myself. The patient can mean a lot. Not only have I learned that my brother and I can get a bit competitive, but if you wait and tolerate what's going on around you, you will end up being rewarded !.
I guess you could say that patience is one of my bang talents. I go through a lot of things that require patience and I go through them without fear. Everyone knows that the wortplore in which to be patient is the eserc of the church ?????? On hunting ?????. You are standing, then sit, then begin, sit down - you then @ PERSON1 and ok ! He @ CAPS1 forever. Boh so I know there are many children who went as a patent like me, some of them have @ @ CAPS2 CAPS3 of other lirastings who make the impatient while for others in just ??? ? you are beautiful. I know ??? People who are like that are really anersetic ???? ???? do here again i know that wostoe il nopele struggles in school and i feel bad enemy them. There are times that start to get impatient when there are other people ???? who are impatient. The worst is that I remained anxious with them and I'm frustrated because little matter ???? ?? times i tell them to stre tuppin, there pencil like to stop complaining just do n't stop . I guess what I'm saying is that every body is different, some people are calm and somebody but, some peaks are atutatic while others are academic. Ain't no different with patience
There was a fish named @ CAPS1. @ CAPS6 lives around the archipelago @ CAPS2, a dangerous place for fish that couldn't slow down quickly. Luckily @ CAPS1 was the legendary codscanth count, all the spec does is float slowly. Yesterday @ CAPS1 caught two fish and gave them to his wife. Today all the fish are in the desert, which @ CAPS1 absolutely despises. Using his patience, @ CAPS6 waits for something to jump. Suddenly @ CAPS6 sees a big chunk of meat on something shiny. But it was too far to catch him. @ CAPS6 went home to his wife. The next day @ CAPS6 went up to speed and saw the floating meat again. @ CAPS6 rushed over and started chewing when something stabbed him. @ CAPS1 started shooting fiercely when @ CAPS6 heard a snap. When @ CAPS6 fired again, @ CAPS6 fell into the stream. @ CAPS6 was finally free! @ CAPS6 also realized that the current was quite nice. @ CAPS6 ate some fish and slept. When @ CAPS6 woke up, @ CAPS6 saw a big ugly fish stand on two fins. @ CAPS1 couldn't breathe and @ CAPS6 was in a no @ CAPS6 broke on one of the other fish's fins and died.
In sport, you always have to be patient. Like you're not making any shots or someone is getting the best of you. If you are patient and keep working hard, sooner or later you will either make those shots or get the most out of this player. @ PERSON1 has been very patient in his basketball career. At @ PERSON2 high where he went to high school, he wasn't the biggest, the fastest, the strongest, or even the best, but he was patient. When he was @ CAPS1 in high school he fought for college, but failed. He was so angry with himself and the coaches because he felt like he should have been part of the team. His mother went to get him and told him not to give up. Unlike most children, @ PERSON1 either didn't quit or thought he wasn't good enough. He remained patient and continued to work hard. It all worked because the following year he was part of the team. He went to @ LOCATION1. He won a championship there with a winning shot. He was then drafted by @ CAPS2 in the @ ORGANIZATION1 draft. The @ CAPS3 were one of the worst teams in @ ORGANIZATION1. It took @ PERSON1 a few years to win their first @ ORGANIZATION1 championship. In his first two seasons, @ PERSON1 has remained calm and won five more championships. In his latest, @ PERSON1 was getting old and he knew he would be tested. They reached the final. The @ CAPS2 were getting tired though. They descended into the @ NUM1 series. @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS2 kept pushing and fighting. Finally the @ CAPS2 won their sixth @ ORGANIZATION1 championship. @ PERSON1 was put in a tough spot, but he remained patient and played like an All-Star.
The day I was patient, it was at the camp and I was there ?? Of course, the person in front of me stood up so I had to be patient. When I got up and threw the first ??? obstacle he was waiting for on the platform. I had to wait for them to take him down. Then I was finally able to get out when I got over half the obstacle. They told me I had to be patient and wait for everyone to get off this platform. It took a few minutes but I was finally able to go ??? that was the day i had to be patient
My mother is a very patient woman. She shows it by helping my brother @ PERSON1 with his homework. @ PERSON1 hates doing all his homework. He hates doing calculations, reading, but above all he hates spelling. When my mom helps him with these three things, she shows patience because since he hates all of these homework, he doesn't always do it without sitting down. When he has a seizure she is very patient with him and works with him until he is done, so my mom is patient.
While waiting to be the best. Music is pretty much my life, I love the way a song can make you feel, I love how walking a line on @ ORGANIZATION1 can change your day. As a young musician I only think about music, I had reached my instrument @ NUM1 @ CAPS1, @ ORGANIZATION2, @ CAPS2, @ ORGANIZATION1, the only instrument my family owns that I cannot play is the bass. So when my @ ORGANIZATION2 broke up I told mr.groth about his need for an @ CAPS3 in the @ CAPS4 group. I studied my butt to learn the art of the bass @ ORGANIZATION1, read the clef and learn the notes, I waited for my ranking to increase and memorization and I quickly fell in love with the instrument. I quickly got better and it seemed to me that every week I got better and better. I had easily fallen in love with the sounds it produced and found out that I liked it much more than the @ ORGANIZATION2, of course it will take time to become a pro but I learned it was worth it sadness.
When I first saw my puppy, @ CAPS3 was at @ ORGANIZATION2. The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 brought a dog to save @ CAPS3 saw the second six dogs I saw, knew he was going to be mine. So @ CAPS3 took him out, the lady said he was scared and had car sickness but I didn't care he was my favorite. @ CAPS3 said @ CAPS3 wanted it so she told us to go to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and tell them @ CAPS3 wanted @ CAPS4 so @ CAPS3 ran to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and on the way @ CAPS3 thought to names. My dad came up with the name @ CAPS6 @ CAPS3 loved him so that was his name. CAPS3 went back to see him with whom I had him every night knowing that I was closer and closer to having him the day finally arrived. @ CAPS3 said my brother @ CAPS3 was going fishing because he didn't know @ CAPS3 was going to have a dog. But once @ CAPS3 there I ran inside to go see him @ CAPS3 brought him home he was afraid everything would even go outside. But @ CAPS7, he loves chasing leaves and playing in the snow. And every night I tell @ CAPS6 it's time to go to bed and sleep with my wonderful @ ORGANIZATION1. Because if you want something bad enough, the patient is the key.
My dad has a girlfriend named @ PERSON1. She has two children, one of seven and one of four. The oldest is @ PERSON2, @ CAPS1 loves to skateboard. The youngest is @ LOCATION1. @ CAPS1 is kind of spaz and if you jumped out of a plane @ CAPS1 would too. That day @ PERSON2 and I were going skateboarding in a park, @ PERSON3 wanted to come but @ CAPS1 didn't even know how to skateboard. @ PERSON2 went to the park and when we got there @ CAPS1 realized that @ CAPS1 didn't have his skateboard. I had to let him use my skate ??? ???. I didn't have a problem with it using it, I just couldn't use it.
I believe that patients mean that you are understanding and tolerant and that a patient person. experiences difficulty without complaining. This story is about when I was patient with my little brother. @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1. Five more minutes than I measured after about fifteen more steps since waking up. I jumped out of bed remembering that I was babysitting my little brother ??? I take the crisp ??? I thought to myself, trying to swallow the stony heart breakfast on my plate. I quickly take a shower and dress in jeans and a t-shirt. At the time, @ PERSON1 was about two years old ??? He missed the serve, he could walk. He is ??? it's hard for anyone to be patient with him because of all his desators he has created. But he wasn't cute, it was extremely difficult to stay mad at him. When I heard the sound of a car entering our ??? I knew we had met @ CAPS3 on ??? enter the house i went up to his arill where he sat ??? wrote for someone to take it out i dressed it ??? and adorable baby for him i brought him to the kitchen and do ???? which were much more powerful than my useful ones. Crunch crunch has become colorful. Lenser under ??? Like we play outside. After the game I played car for a while it was dinner we had more and before we knew it was night time I sat him in the tub and then I went to get him, he came back ??? the whole bathroom was wet with hot bath water when i ??? and dressed, @ CAPS3 was not in the tap I ??? like water to him when i was about to ??? and helped him get.
I have been a patient man in my life. An example is when I wanted to see @ LOCATION1 it was an @ CAPS1 line. I was in the mall and from where @ LOCATION1 was, it was going up the street. It was @ NUM1 and my bedtime is @ NUM2 so I had to hurry. My sister and I ran to the end of the line where we were, me and our parents. They saved us a place in the queue. Everything was ready @ NUM3 after @ NUM4 and the line didn't even move. I was so angry. Every @ NUM5, the line moved a bit. When I was about to leave the line, I started to rise like an army. @ CAPS2 when I started to get excited. All I wanted to ask him was to get me an airsoft gun and a pony. The reason is that I was riding the pony and shooting people who crossed my path. It would have been life. @ CAPS2 whatever I wanted to do. And I think @ LOCATION1 would give me a good airsoft gun because @ DATE1 may arrive sooner than expected. While I was talking to my guys the next step was. We went to???. I asked him what I wanted and he said "you are going to shoot yourself". @ CAPS2 when I got angry because you had to be so patient. This is the last time I will visit @ LOCATION1 at the mall.
One time I was patient was when I was at my football and the defense was hiding the ball and waiting to come home. Eventually my friend @ PERSON1 intercepted the ball and attacked including me on the pitch and then they made me run down the middle and I scored then we passed it for the two point conversion and it came to me but it was high and it made it tilt then it fell into my hands and I got it but then I had to wait again because the defense ?? back but it was half-time. I'm coming back from the kick and we got the ball back as I received the kick and returned it all the way for a touchdown and it was really cool because my ball was bleeding and I broke a lot of tackles. So it was @ DATE1 all the others ?? we do it on our knees and finally my ?? passed the pass and if we have ?? My team jumped on it and we got the ball and then our full back gave a pass and won the winning game and that's when I had to be patient
The definition of patients is, when someone is in a car, and takes a long distance trip and you don't ask to stop or keep asking and asking where you are going. An example of patients is you are in a store, and someone is in front of you with a huge overload of things in the kart, and you don't get mad at the person called the patients. Also, if you teach someone something and they keep messing it up and you don't get angry and keep trying to teach them, they're patients. Another example of patients is if someone has @ CAPS1 and they have a hard time paying attention and you are not frustrated with them, then you are patient with that person. Also, if the person walks away and doesn't pay attention to you and you are still trying to teach or show them something that is a sign of patients. Sometimes patients because if you maybe don't want to work as a therapist, you need a lot of patients. These are some definitions of patients.
Patience. What is patience? Patience is waiting for something calmly. Her waiting for the right time to propose, or ask her for a date. Life is going to be tough unless your patient is. You have to be patient when you get a job.
This is an article on how I had to be patient to get a fanominal bowl from @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. My grandparents had just picked up my brother and I from our house to pick up @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 at Cold Stone. I have never been to the Cold Stone, but my friends said it was fine. So I asked my grandparents if we could go. I was amplified. When we got to our destination the queue was huge. He was shaped like a snake. The sign said "@ NUM1 minutes wait." I was disported. I was about to leave when I saw him. Peanut butter @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. It was looking me straight in the eye so I talked to my grandparents and said we could stay. When we finally got to row one, I ordered peanut butter @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. It was time to send my taste buds on vacation. It was fantastic @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. It was so sweet. I was thinking to myself how happy I was to have had the time to send this amazing @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. This was the time when I had to be patient to go get a fanominall @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 bowl.
Patient means that you are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulty without complaining. There was a time when I was patient. It's hard to be patient @ CAPS11 I've done this before. "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2, it's not even moving." Brother @ CAPS3 and brother @ CAPS3 were clearly not patient. Hello, @ CAPS13 me mame i mean man can you take any shower? "@ CAPS4, I can if you want." A nice man said in a kind and friendly voice to @ CAPS5. " @ CAPS6, are you that stupid, I wasn't for real. I cut you off just because of your stupidity. @ CAPS5 said, trying to act fiercely. @ CAPS5 had only to a year older than me (@ NUM1) and he thinks he's all grown up and can do whatever he wants. "@ CAPS8, little man you can't cut me, I stood in line for always. : this nice man said to @ CAPS5. "Well that's a shame." while @ CAPS3's brother was doing eniesnes, patiently waiting for the line even though the line didn't really move, inside I wanted to take everyone out @ CAPS11 not like some people I have patients with and I can wait. After @ CAPS3's brother cut this man off and wasn't punished, he decided to cut hundreds of people. All these people were angry, very, very angry with @ CAPS5 @ CAPS11 none of them did nothing but say "@ CAPS8 don't cut me." @ CAPS11 which didn't really help. Until @ CAPS5 has cut person @ CAPS15. This person was a young beautiful body with beautiful blue eyes and such a lovely blonde hair, her name was @ PERSON1 "@ CAPS13 me police officer, that young little boy just cut us and everyone else. " @ PERSON1 a said. While I waited patiently, @ CAPS5 got kicked out of the whole park '@ CAPS15 online please, " " @ CAPS1 it's me…. Won.Were “was the best roller coaster I have ever seen. Being patient is difficult @ CAPS11 can be rewarding. I have also learned that being patient takes a lot of understanding and tolerance. Now @ CAPS16 knows you are getting the best out of your patient. And the worst when you're not.
A kid in my school, @ PERSON1, has a crush on my best friend my rude for who knows how long. He asked her about fifty times. She loves him like a friend but nothing more. She's been dating a lot of guys since @ PERSON1 first asked her out. Mycaela can be an obsessed little boy. In fact, she's now dating a boy I asked to date two days ago, sorry about that. Anyway, @ PERSON1 is still very patient, hoping mycaela will come back someday. He has been harassing her for almost two years and she still has not returned. I just think @ PERSON1 is very patient and is a big kid.
I once was patient when my mom was on the phone with my dad for at least @ NUM1 hours. We were in the car on our way to @ LOCATION1. I watched my dog on my lap during the @ NUM2 hour. The second hour, I was asleep. By the third hour I was watching a movie and at that point I really had to go to the bathroom. Then, for the last hour and a half, I was about to cry. I must have been so bad that my mom hung up the phone. We were at my aunt's house. I ran into the bathroom and was fine.
I am @ PERSON1 and a year ago I was a foster child. I had to have patience for a lot of things. First of all, my adoptive parents divorced with children. I had to wait until my adoptive mother found a house to move into. Second, I was not told when I could return home. I had to wait until it was all over. Finally, they told me after a year and a half that I could go home to my mother within a week. I packed my bags and waited. I had to be patient with everyone. It was hard, extremely hard, the mad mind hard. It took me two weeks and a day to get home and on top of everything I had to bring home and unpack my things, I'm still unpacking. Being a host family takes a lot of patience. I learned that.
A new restaurant had just opened in town! He really wanted to go so his family left. It had opened @ NUM1 minutes ago. They didn't think there would be a line. They got there and saw no cars in the driveway. They crossed the aisle that began at the back of the restaurant. Then they talk about cars @ NUM2. He was really mad. They were about to leave and there were cars @ NUM3 behind them, so they stayed on the line. Since it was a new restaurant, everyone chose their food very slowly. They also made the food very slowly. Then people started shouting “ @ CAPS1 up ”, they were honking their horns as well, but he was the only one who did not honk. They were waiting @ NUM2 minutes and @ NUM1 had gone @ CAPS3. He was hungry and he was always very patient. He is generally not patient. He was very excited to eat at the new restaurant. When it was his turn, the cashier said: "@ CAPS2 you are very patient." @ CAPS3 the time they got their food, it took @ NUM6 hours. The food was not even good! He showed a lot of patience that day. He didn't honk and he wasn't screaming. He had been in the car at NUM6 hours and was starving. It is good to have patience.
It's all about patience, patience is when someone gives you an older or specific job to do. Then you do the job or order without @ CAPS1 asked even if you don't used to do it last week my mom told me to clean the living room even knowing it was difficult i dont still haven't. Even knowing that I didn't wanna do it was unfair
Patience is a very important virtue. He is valued in at least these @ NUM1 aspects of life: success and friendship. If you don't have patience, no one will want to be your friend. You must have patience with your friends or they will not be your friends. I know this from experience. To be successful in life in general, you need to have patience. Whether it's waiting for the bus or waiting for a job interview response, it will always matter. So in conclusion, I think patience is a very, very important thing to have.
I believe patience is important for many reasons. One of the reasons is that without patience, you wouldn't be able to expect anything. An example is that you wouldn't be able to wait in line. My second reason why patience is important is that without it people would complain every day because you use patience every day. For example, if you are waiting to buy a ticket or to get gasoline, you have to wait your turn to get it. Finally, patience is important because without patience, I would not be able to read. This is because books sometimes take a long time to read and you wouldn't want to take the time to finish them. This is exactly why I think patience is important.
I once went to a carnival with my dad. We had a blast during our stay. I kept winning prizes at the games they had. I thought " nothing will bother me " and I was wrong. Everyone has their own level of patience. Mine is low but this time I was tolerant and stayed calm. As we were at the carnival, we saw this new merry-go-round. Everyone was lined up to see what it was. When I stood in line I was ready to continue. Until someone walks past me. It was then that I started to get impatient. It won't be good. I waited and waited as the line slowly moved up. It seemed like an hour, but it was only @ NUM1 minuets. People kept getting ahead of me. As if they didn't see me, more people too. I got to the point where I was about to make a rude remark. As I was about to say the rude things in my mind, I quickly held back. I remembered that I wanted my dad to be proud of me. So, since it was my turn to continue, I finally did something right. I was so proud of myself for how I didn't say anything. Once the trip was over, I quickly went to see my father. I am so proud of myself for how tolerant I was. The people ahead of me weren't that bad. Looks like I can do something positive. If they thought it was going to get to me, they were right. But, they were wrong if they were going to say something.
Every day I have to be patient in difficult things. I have to be very patient when I play or watch sports. Whenever my brother plays in a soccer league, he can be suspicious. I have to bite for almost two hours for the games to end and my parents get me into the game. My favorite speed is soccer and since being a first baseman and eating pitches; I have to wait for the ball at ??? so I can help the team. I also have to be patient during the meap because it is long and I have to wait for people to finish. As you can see, I am very patient in many situations.
Freezing cold and all I could do was wait, and wait, and wait. What I was waiting for was the @ CAPS1 @ DATE1 for @ CAPS2 to start. I had friends with me but they mostly talk to themselves, leaving me and my friend @ PERSON1. Her dirty blonde hair whips her face and @ CAPS7 the curve against the wind. My yellow lab, @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS3 his leash and @ PERSON1, being the one holding the leash, stumbles to the side. "Are you sure you don't want me to take it?" I ask for the time of the teeth. "@ CAPS4, I got it !" @ CAPS7 said happily. I was cold, fucked up and hungry, but at least I didn't have my arm ripped off. "Are you sure?" I felt so bad, @ LOCATION1 was my dog, I should hold him. Which was an easy task at @ CAPS4. "@ CAPS5 !" @ CAPS7 said lightly : "I got it !" @ LOCATION1 pulls it again and @ CAPS7 falls inside me. I grab it and @ CAPS7 mumbles an apology. I had, but still think I should take it. All day long I complained. I was partly joking about our luck with the weather, but more importantly, I just wanted to strike up a conversation. "I think my hands are numb," I said, clasping them in my pockets. “@ CAPS6, at least it's not raining, as the meteorologist said,” @ CAPS7 smiles, and I smile back. A voice rises from the specker, “@ CAPS8 walkers. Let's go ! " I look @ PERSON1 and asked again :" Do you want me to take him ! " @ CAPS7 pats me on the back and said slowly:" I understand. "
One time I was patient was when I had to babysit my little cousin. He was just a little baby, so I knew if he did start to cry or get upset, I couldn't be frustrated with him because he's a baby. There were times he would start crying for no apparent reason and I just wanted to scream, @ CAPS1, I knew I couldn't and just had to be patient with him. I also knew that I couldn't get mad or angry because it might make the situation worse for him, so I had to be patient and wait for him to stop crying and calm down before I could approach him. him. I was understanding and tolerant and I did not lose my patience. The practice of this skill is very important. I take pride in myself and that I can keep my cool in crazy or chaotic situations like this, and not lose my temper or my patience, with him or with someone else.
Ugh, what's taking gym teacher @ CAPS14's time ? @ PERSON1 moans. "@ CAPS1 lasted for hours" "@ CAPS1 only lasted @ NUM1 minutes." @ PERSON2 said. "@ CAPS3, @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 feels like it's been a few hours." @ PERSON1 said. "@ CAPS4, you just need to have a little patience." @ CAPS5 explained. "@ CAPS6" said @ PERSON1. "@ CAPS7 you sit here and you have your @ CAPS14 called patience, I @ CAPS8 put my bag on stage." @ CAPS9 @ PERSON1 stood up, everyone tried to tell him to sit down but all he did was ignore them. "@ CAPS10'man man sit down and have patience" @ PERSON2 said "@ CAPS11 i waited too long I'm bored I'm tired and my feet hurt!" @ PERSON1 yelled @ CAPS9 as he walked behind the stage. "@ CAPS12 is going to be in trouble." @ PERSON2 said, looking down. "@ CAPS13 was just screaming :" the gym teacher shouted with an angry face. The gym teacher looked to his right and saw @ PERSON1 behind the stage and said "@ CAPS12 couldn't play basketball but @ PERSON1 messed up @ CAPS1 for everyone." @ CAPS14 nobody played because @ PERSON1 had no patience. @ CAPS14 Hope today he has a little more patience, hopefully.
I woke up before school started to get ready, took all my things and went out. When I got to school I started going out with my friends and having a great day so far. Around @ NUM1, @ NUM2 time is up and we go to lunch. I wasn't hungry and wanted to go with my friend @ CAPS1 she wanted to eat so I waited for her and we went out after. When we go out we like to do backsides, back downs, backbends, fronthandsprings, cartwheels and stuff like that. After the bell rang in @ NUM3 hour, it was a remedy. I was not feeling well, I was hungry. I just wanted to come home and have something to eat, but we still had to wait for the end of the remedies, then we had to take the bus for about an hour. When I finally got home I was not feeling well my dad asked me what the problem was I told him I was hungry and it was around @ NUM4 and he said we had to wait for mom to come home. Had to wait and be patient for @ NUM5 hours and realized it was okay to wait because it was a delicious dinner and if I had eaten something else before dinner I probably wouldn't have didn't eat my dinner and if I would have eaten something else before dinner, I probably wouldn't have eaten my dinner. And that was a story with @ NUM6 examples where I had to be patient.
There haven't been a lot of times I've been patient, but I'm going to tell you about when I was patient. One time I was patient was when I was driving home by bus. My bus driver @ PERSON1 made me sit in the back because she said I was talking too much and was not out loud to speak the whole way home. It was hard at first but then I did my homework. Which gave me something to do. It was a time when I was patient but not the only time. Another time, when I was patient, I stood in line for a roller coaster in cedar paint. The start of the line said it was a @ NUM1 hour wait but we didn't care because it was my friend's and my favorite ride it wasn't that bad because it's worth it when you make the trip. It was times when I was patient but I had to patiently wait even longer than that!
Hi my name is @ LOCATION1 @ DATE1 and this is when I was patient while waiting to go to a friend's house. Savannah's dad is a firefighter and he had to set it on fire and couldn't pick me up until the next afternoon. I was sad. It was in the middle of @ DATE2 and I haven't seen a savannah for @ NUM1 months. That day I learned that patience is a way of life that people have to live with and this is the time that I had to live with it.
There I was at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 a @ DATE1 standing under a blazing sun. I could feel the sweat pouring down my face. I figured there was at least two hours left to queue for the roller coaster. The @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5. @ CAPS7 was silent as they were getting irritable. All of a sudden this guy yelled, "@ CAPS6 up !" @ CAPS7 online started yelling at each other except for me. I didn't mean to scream because @ CAPS7 would work even better. An hour later, everyone has calmed down. Then I looked forward. @ CAPS10 were almost up front. I wiped my face and smiled. Then I said: "@ CAPS8 hoo!" @ CAPS7 looked at me like I came from another planet. My ?? "What?" my mom asked. “ @ CAPS10 is almost up front ! " I replied. Then @ CAPS10 was the next to go around. When @ CAPS10 entered the arena, I buckled up my seat. Then the ride took off! The breeze made me feel good against my face. At the end of the ride, I said, " I knew the patients would be paying ." This is the time that I had to have patients.
It was scorching hot, it was already an hour in line, "when can we go?" I asked in a moining voice. My parents told me "be patient, they were almost in the front". @ CAPS1, that ??? I what I did. My body ??? I had trouble walking all day, but that wasn't going to stop me from doing all these walks. Ten more minutes had passed and I started to feel thirsty. My @ CAPS3 and my sister want to go have a drink with me while my mom held us in line. We arrived at the stand. "I'm going to take some water" I say, ??? realized. I said thank you as I grabbed the icy water from her hands. As we all started to walk back to the queue, I spotted a brightly colored shirt that read, “@ CAPS2. I couldn't help but ask, "@ CAPS3 can I get this shirt please ?" we still have to wait a little longer if we go back. "@ CAPS4 he replied but hurry @ CAPS1 your mother is not getting impatient. After I got the shirt on we got back in line. Thank God we were second. All aboard of the mummy. The person controlling the ride explained. We kept walking, the patience paid off, because I felt this ride was going to be great.
'' @ CAPS1 '' my name is @ CAPS2 ?? and it's a story about the time I was patient. Once when I was eight, my mother said she would take me to the fair that day. so after lunch we went in the rain. I wanted to do the biggest ride there so we had to queue for it ?? the line was very long so I had to be patient to get on the ride. I didn't want to stand in line so half the time I was complaining but the line wasn't that long and I have to be patient. I'm glad I was patient because the ride was ?? Of pleasure. That day I walked it was good to be patient. I said to my ?? I will never be impatient again. Was that the story ?? The time I had to be patient with them ??
Being patient is a good thing to have. Let me tell you about a time I was patient. Once I had a dentist appointment was @ NUM1 am and my appointment was at @ NUM2 am. My dad and I sat down and waited until @ NUM2. It hurt. I had nothing to do with @ CAPS1. I don't read @ CAPS1 magazines, they didn't have @ CAPS1 a @ CAPS1.V or whatever. I was really hungry because @ CAPS1 hadn't had any breakfast. @ NUM4 am still waiting. I could '@ CAPS1 do it. I was so bored until I remembered I had a @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3.S in my pocket. So I took it out and started playing it. Time passed quickly. It was then that I was patient.
Patience the thing that's going is mostly telling you the time and me going and you about a time when I was patient and how I was doing things to make myself patient. One day my dad and I tried to wait in the hospital to get a travel replacement and we had to sit and wait in the waiting room @ CAPS2 @ NUM1 hour. I was wondering why wait @ CAPS2 all the time and come by hand. Well the thing kept telling us wait @ NUM1 more hour. Anyway i hurt i stopped next to my mouth in the chest two hours then touched my chest was quite a sure look when it was to ride a @ CAPS1. Then after that when we counted the circular tiles @ CAPS2 @ NUM3 minutes and noted that I remember them on @ NUM4 tiles. That the can climb, I haven't complained about that yet at least. After counting the tiles in a circle I played @ CAPS2 with my dad, won and we ate @ NUM5 minutes @ CAPS2 the rest of the time I played my @ CAPS3. I played @ ORGANIZATION1 and the game. I was me for a while and then I did. @ NUM6 plus it was time to get home my dad and i was tired beyond any help. I haven't complained once and that's when I was patient.
Is patience really the hardest thing and the body really? Is that a?. I'm tough because I'm being punished for not doing what I was supposed to do. So I have to be patient and what he does until he's patient is what a perfect team has to do. From my pop of how. So while I'm in punishment I'm just waiting for my time to come because I can't speed up there and make it ??? faster but if i could i would but for now i have to want to. I'm a permanent for quite a while, so I can just be patient. I know before I do hard things, but most people have to because rushing probably isn't the way to do it. Patience also helps the maker and camera save you time. Patience is also a good thing to have because you can definitely want things like; money, clothes, shoes, houses, food, animals (pets), jobs, education, car (transport and other southern things because at your post rush whatever you want, get it like you planned it, but wait and be patient can get you exactly what you want and exactly how you want it to be!
As I sit in the waiting room at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 at @ ORGANIZATION1 waiting and waiting for my grandpa to come to your recovery room. I wonder if something was wrong or if he was unsuccessful in having the operation. Then I say to my @ CAPS3 " can we see grandpa now ", she said " @ CAPS4 be patient it will be fine if you sit back relax and for Hevan's sake " be patient ! " " @ CAPS5 "I said to my @ CAPS3. After an hour I ended up saying so I thought to myself and said to myself cahlem and patient, calm and patient. Then this lady came out to the waiting room and said "the operation took a little longer than expected but everything went perfectly fine but he will stay in the hospital for a week and a half at most" which suited me perfectly. as long as I was out of this boring hospital and as soon as I said I had my mother tell my mother as soon as grandfather arrives in the recovery room, we'll go see him and then we'll leave!
One time I had patience was when I was waiting in the car to get to @ LOCATION2. From my house at @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION2 it's about @ NUM1 hours. So I had to sit in a car for @ NUM1 hours. The only things to do were listen to your iPod and go to sleep. Which I neither did. As you can see, it would take a lot of patience to wait in a car for @ NUM1 hours. After an hour, I would have felt like @ NUM4 if you didn't do anything. At that point, I was ready to play with my sleeping sister. I knew I couldn't do this. Now was the time to think of something to do. I took out my phone and started texting people but no one answered. I tried to look out the window but it put me to sleep. Getting there took too long. Finally @ NUM1 hours have passed and we have arrived at @ LOCATION2. It was a time when I had patience
I was gone, I was gone on the rama to be exact. @ CAPS3 @ CAPS1 got to see a whole bunch of cool old cars, @ CAPS1 got to see some old cars as well. Some cars were old and rusty and others are new and state of the art. @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 saw a sign. It's read come see chip foose! So @ CAPS1 went and looked around. "@ CAPS1 found it! I exclaimed." @ CAPS2 "@ CAPS8 brother shouted." @ CAPS3 is! "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 went to see the end of the line. It was @ CAPS5! So @ CAPS1 thought he would die after half an hour. @ CAPS1 had it all wrong. It was @ CAPS5! The @ CAPS1 line thought it was large was nothing compared to the line now, so @ CAPS1 has had to wait, wait and wait. @ CAPS8 brother goes to the point where he could run a mile if he didn't he was going to explode. So I had to go for a walk with him. I was relieved because to stay standing and doing nothing for hours @ NUM1 becomes boring very quickly. I arrived at the point where I had to get up and walk or I was going to enjoy myself to sleep. So I went for a walk with him. @ CAPS1 came back and I sat down @ CAPS1 waited, and waited, and waited and waited. @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 heard stop ! " The body of @ CAPS6 behind these people must go and come back after the break. "@ CAPS7 the security guard. @ CAPS1 were the last people. The people in front of us were a nerdy couple with no life. @ CAPS8 brother started crying because he didn't get any autograph of fooses. Nice nerdy couple @ CAPS7 "here our @ CAPS1 spat all day and you @ CAPS2 like you really want that autograph." @ CAPS8 brother replied “sniff @ CAPS9 don't you!” @ CAPS1 got it after 51 / @ NUM1 hours of waiting and waiting and waiting and dying. That was the time when j had to be patient.
Patients are people who have been similarly injured and are in the hospital trying or improving. I was a patient once because I was sick for a very long time, so my mother went to the hospital and I was shot. On leaving the hospital, I passed out and hit my chin on the door, so we had to stay at their house for about an hour. It was the only time I was in the hospital as a patient.
I was patient when I was home yesterday watching the movie called @ CAPS1. So I waited a long time until the food was ready and he ?? I was so interested in the movie that I couldn't watch TV because the movie was so good until I was really hungry, then after that I got a second plate after that second plate, I couldn't eat the rest of my food. And I didn't complain about being hungry.
Being patient is when someone could be bisy, you better be patient while the other person is done. I will write about a time when someone I know was patient. Well one morning my mom had retired from work when she arrived, I told my mom that I really wanted to go to my friends. But my mom kept saying wait and so I had to wait so I did? My mom wasn't even finished yet, so I told her if I could go work with my friends. But she said no and that I had to be patient until she was done. My father lived off his work in the afternoon so I had a slow motion. I told my dad if he could drop me off with my friends and then he could make a living from his job. So I went to tell him. But guess what he said no because he was already late and I looked at the time and yes he was already late so I decided to just be patient because my mom was almost done and my dad was already leaving so I just sat down and watched TV while my mom was done. My mom walked into the room so I got up and asked if she was done and she said "yes" I screamed so much then you fire me and she did. I went there and my mom was gone and this is the day I went to my friends just to be patient.
I think patience is the ability to be quiet and to wait at the same time. For example, patience is needed with everyday tasks like standing in line for lunch, waiting for someone to pick you up, waiting for your doctor to examine you. I have to be patient almost @ NUM1 times a day. First I have to be patient for my mother to take me to school. I also have to be patient for the class assignment to pass, for the class to be over, for lunch to begin, for the night to come, etc. I hear people say that patience is a virtue. I didn't even know it meant, but if I'm patient I'll probably find out. So my conclusion is that it takes patience and people use it every day. I think patience is a gift and I appreciate it.
ON @ DATE2, I understand what my mom was saying to @ CAPS1. She told @ CAPS1 that she couldn't get anything from @ CAPS1 for @ CAPS2 because she had to pay the bills. She didn't think she was doing much for @ CAPS1, I told her I was okay with what I had. I just wanted to be with her for @ CAPS2 but she couldn't understand that she was doing well on her own, my dad wasn't helping her take care of us. My mom had to take care of her @ NUM1 children but she and @ NUM2 of them are hers. But my dad always said I know if he had it he would give it to @ CAPS1. But being @ CAPS1, I didn't want to hear his stuff because it was all lies. My mom had to find towing jobs, to keep up with everything. Then when @ DATE1 arrived everything was fine until @ DATE1 my grandmother passed away. My mom, aunt and uncle @ PERSON1 all had to make money for all the stuff here she looked pretty it all happened but just know we still cry thinking about her. Then that was a time when I didn't wait because it was too hard to think she was gone. So they and my mom are all telling @ CAPS1 that I need to learn to figure out that she's in a better place with some of her loved ones. But to this day, I can't understand the meaning of when someone says he's gone. But @ CAPS6 forgot.
The time I was patient. One day we were on our way to @ ORGANIZATION1. Our trip was only supposed to last three ours, but one of the cars behind us was stopped by something that punctured its tire. We had to wait an hour before they got their tires fixed and caught up with us. They also had to pass traffic and long traffic lights. We waited at a gas station and they caught up with us. Everyone used the toilet which took fifteen minutes and the toilet was so disgusting it took a minute to dress them appropriately. There were three cars containing five to six people, which took longer. Once we were all done we piled into each vehicle and headed back to @ ORGANIZATION1. We were walking past all the kings signs that said "@ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1" and @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 ahead "and even of course when we got there I saw this huge digital sign that was playing music and Said "@ CAPS1 to. @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1" ! We were finally there! We were excited and had the time of our lives !!! By: unica @ CAPS2 .Amstrong
"@ PERSON1 let's go, this line is taking too long !" "@ CAPS1 @ PERSON2 just be patient!" "@ CAPS2 ?" Asked @ PERSON2 "@ CAPS3 @ NUM1 replied. " @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 ? " " Have you never heard of a patient? "@ CAPS1" "@ CAPS6 you mean that on all of you Thirteen years have you never heard of patients? " " @ CAPS1 "" @ CAPS6 you try to tell me that in all these thirteen years you have never heard of patience? " " @ CAPS9 " @ PERSON2 replied in a confused voice. "@ CAPS10 @ CAPS12 Well the patient is when. Wow I never know if patience would be @ CAPS6 hard to explain. "@ CAPS11, do you understand now why I don't know !" “ I got it ! He yelled, snapping his fingers. @ CAPS16, one in line was looking at them. There the faces turned red. But @ PERSON1 ignored this fact and said: "@ CAPS12 @ CAPS6 patience is like when you wait a long time but you do n't care to wait a long time and in the end because you @ CAPS20 patiently get what you wanted . " @ CAPS6 @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 @ CAPS20 and @ CAPS20 and @ CAPS20 online. Soon @ CAPS21, they were next. “ @ CAPS14 tickets for @ CAPS15 @ CAPS16 where I look please : @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 said excitedly. "@ CAPS17 ummm wait a second while I open a new package of tickets." said the clerk to them. @ PERSON2 looked @ PERSON1 then said "@ CAPS12 @ CAPS19 @ CAPS20 @ CAPS21: @ CAPS19 @ CAPS20 in that row for twenty minutes and now I have to wait more?" @ CAPS23 you go kids it's @ CAPS14 dollars please. " @ PERSON2 was embarrassed yet happy to get their tickets, @ PERSON1 said" @ CAPS11 you @ CAPS20 and got what you wanted is called patience. @ CAPS6 @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 sat in the movie theater and watched a good movie. If they had been patient they would never have gotten to see their new favorite movie @ CAPS11 !
Patience is a key role in life. If you are not patient, you will live a miserable life. Almost everything in life requires patience. If you are not patient, you will likely come up with something like your job if you are not patient with your boss or coworkers. I often find it difficult to be patient with my mom and dad. Sometimes I can't stand my parents anymore and I lose my temper and get impatient with them which usually makes things worse for me. I love my brother but he can get really boring like most little siblings do. When my brother gets on my nerves, I get very impatient with him. Sometimes I get so angry and impatient with him that I just just lose him and always get in trouble when I beat him and always end up being the bad guy because of my patience. Now that I'm older and realize how important it is to be patient with people, it makes life a lot easier and fun with people. I'm here every day and that's why when you are patient you get what you want but when you are impatient because you are trying to get what you want it will never happen.
The time I was patient was when my friend arrived, I was excited. But I waited and waited. But she ended up @ CAPS1. It is more or less that.
I was patient, I had to wait for my grandfather in the emergency room. For his heart because he is not doing very well, my grandfather goes in and out of the emergency room. For my grandfather heats all the my grandfather's days must go to decert to throw her heart so I'm patient.
Patience is something you develop when you are calm and relaxed. I was patient every day at school. Be patient with my teachers. I have been patient with the kids in school who like to photograph people and tease them. I have patients some days and others, it means that something is wrong and it means that I don't have any more. I like having patients because it relaxes you and everything. Patients are a good thing you can have. I think patents increase your lifespan. A lot of people around the world don't have a lot of patients and I think that shortens your lifespan. I don't think if I didn't have patients I wouldn't be in school right now because some kids just have problems and they don't and they got bad grades and things.
In this narrative essay, I will be writing about @ NUM1 different times I have been out, I had to be patient. Such about waiting to leave school on a public holiday. And when I had to wait for my mom to wake up to go to the mall so I could have my game. Another thing I had to wait was to get my final like in the ??? all these times, I had to be understanding. One day, I couldn't wait to leave school on a Friday. And to do that, the snap was dark and I had a schedule planned for my day of reflection. When a thought passed by as another started to reflect, I could look at the slaughter and that changed. I was about to get a call at home but the @ CAPS1.A saved me. And I had to be understanding about this moment. Another time I had to be understanding was when I had to wait for my mom to wake up so I could go to the mall. See what happened, I had a @ NUM1 @ NUM3 last year on my report and a new game was coming out so I wanted it. My mom was sleeping, it was almost impossible to wake her up as she had been to the club the day before. And that's when I had to be patient.
I'm currently writing my comic, I haven't started drawing it yet. Here is a major scene from the book @ NUM1. "@ CAPS1, @ LOCATION1, are we there already?" @ CAPS2 asked curiously "@ CAPS3. not yet "@ PERSON1 replied with a sound of fear in his voice. They were lost, really lost. " Are we there already? " little @ CAPS2 asked again. " @ CAPS3, @ CAPS2, we just have to be patient. "@ ORGANIZATION1 said, getting annoyed very quickly. So we walked for hours, but still @ CAPS3 sign from the castle. Little @ CAPS2 was eager to meet the Queen, as she had imagined the Queen as a kind, patient and beautiful woman. @ ORGANIZATION1 could @ CAPS9 that @ CAPS2 was tired, lifting her onto her shoulders, she said @ CAPS2, "@ CAPS9 if you can @ CAPS9 the castle from here @ CAPS2." @ CAPS11 a few long patient minutes, @ CAPS2 finally saw the castle "I @ CAPS9 that, I @ CAPS9 that!" She said with a smile. Hopping off @ ORGANIZATION1's shoulder, she rushed down the narrow path. Because she had waited, she was more excited than ever. Not only because she had found the castle, but because she had learned to be patient.
One time I was patient was when I got my braces. I was so nervous, so it was hard to be patient. I waited for about fifteen minutes, then the assistant called me . first she told me what she was going to do, second she took an x-ray of my teeth, third she put metal ties with very strong glue on the back of my teeth, fourth @ PERSON1 put the brackets with very strong glue. Then the assistant put the wire between the supports and the metal hands, finally, she asked me what color I wanted then she put them and I was free to go. The whole process took two hours, and I had to sit in a dental chair for that long. I had a lot of patience it was hard but I did it. It was then that I had patience.
" So do you want @ CAPS1 for your @ DATE1 ?" " " A @ NUM1 "" @ CAPS1 else do you want? " A @ NUM1 "I have wanted a @ NUM3 playstation for so long. This is my thirteenth @ DATE1 and I never wanted anything more. All my friends had it. Every time I went to their house , we were playing night and day. I wanted one… I wanted one really daddy. The only exception was that it cost @ MONEY1 and I already had a @ MONEY2 @ DATE1 party, overall it would be an @ MONEY3 @ DATE1. So my mom and I decided on a deal @ CAPS3 I pay @ MONEY4 then she will pay the other half. From that day forward I asked everyone for some gift money for my @ DATE1. I don't want any other gifts, I had my eye on the prize. So normally you have a family party where all the family members come to give you your gift and celebrate. I knew that is where I would get my @ MONEY4. Everything looked perfect, I had it all planned out. Host the family party a few days after @ DATE1, then buy my @ NUM1 ! This didn't mind waiting two or three days. I thought I would live. "Hey mom when are we going to have a family party?" "@ DATE2." @ CAPS2 at this point steam was coming out of my ears, i could feel my face burning like i was putting my head in a fire. You @ MONTH1 don't realize it @ DATE2 is one month away from my @ DATE1. @ CAPS3 waiting for @ NUM5 days is not patient so I don't know @ CAPS1. As of this day I still haven't got my @ NUM1, but in two days I'll be holding a stack of cash in my hands and heading to the gamertop : @ CAPS3 I had to wait longer, I probably wouldn't have. I am not very patient.
Once when I was patient, it was the birthday party of my cousins friends. I was patient because the whole time we were at the party I was waiting for a response from my parents and relatives of my friends to see if my friend and I could have a sleepover. So while my friends and I waited, we colored in some dinosaur pictures, watched a movie, had dinner, played in the basement, went to the garage and ate cakes and ice cream, decorated / painted our dance tool boxes, colorful some more photos, watch my friends cousin open his gifts and much more. Then it started to get dark outside so we tried to grab a little card @ CAPS1, it was tough with a whole bunch of kids screaming. Soon it was time for my friend to go, then my parents said we could have a sleepover, @ CAPS1 OF @ CAPS2 my friends mom said don't do it tonight because my friend has a game of volleyball in @ TIME1. I felt like I wasn't expecting anything. Then I realized that when your patient you get what you want more often.
Being patient is important, as I have already learned from experience. Once I chose to keep my cousins @ and @ PERSON1 PERSON3. @ PERSON1 is eight years old and @ PERSON3 is six years old. I had to watch them for three hours on my own. I was able to call my @ CAPS1 @ PERSON2 whenever I needed help, but if I called I wouldn't get paid. @ CAPS3 was to be paid twenty dollars if I could handle @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON3. This is how I was able to do it. I arrived at my @ CAPS1 around half past one sharp. @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON3 had just returned from a friend's birthday party, where they surely devoured a ton of sweet foods, like @ CAPS2, cakes and ice cream. @ CAPS3 could tell they were hyper from the moment I walked through the door when they greeted me with bubbly attitudes. My @ CAPS1 is gone and I was stuck with them. @ PERSON1 wanted to play on his Play Station. But @ PERSON3 waited to play @ NUM1 box. I started to get angry when they started arguing over what to do. I was about to call @ PERSON2 when I decided that being a little more patient was well worth paying. So to sort out their contradiction, I found a game we could all play and enjoy. After playing the game for two hours, we went to their backyard. @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON3 played tag while I watched. However, @ PERSON3 being the unfair, denied that @ PERSON1 tagged him and started to split up. I was immediately frustrated with them and picked up the phone. But then I decided that with only an hour left I could handle them. So I told them we could play hide and seek instead, and while I would normally hate being the seeker, @ CAPS3 told them that only me would count so they didn't fight. Finally @ PERSON2 came home and I was paid the money @ CAPS3 had earned. That day, I learned that being patient always has its rewards.
Patience @ CAPS1 is being polite while waiting for someone or something. It is polite to be patient, if you are not patient it means that you are pretty much mean because you are judging someone or making them do something very quickly. For example, if you are waiting in a line for a ride in a town or something, then if you are patient, be nice to other people by not trying to hurry or something like that. If you. are impatient and you stand in line you would be mean to others saying "hurry up, I want to do this ride or hurry up and start the ride already." There is the example. If you are a patient person, people will probably like you. If you're impatient, you'll probably have a hard time getting along with someone.
There are many times that I have been patient. Once I was doing the @ CAPS1 test, we spent a lot of time on different parts of the test. I was always done early, so I couldn't move on to the next part. Also, we couldn't talk or get out of the sets. I really wanted to move on to the next part because I had a lot of time and nothing to do. Everyone in the class finished early to feel like we couldn't speak, we just sat and weighed so that the testing time was over I think everyone wanted to move on to the next part but we didn't not complained or said nothing to do this for a few days every year. Every year, I am always patient. It's a story about when I'm patient.
@ NUM1 Patience is when you understand and don't complain. A person who is patient is someone who can wait and they don't do it every two seconds. A person like that can be successful in life. @ NUM2 @ CAPS1 ! @ PERSON2 was getting closer. First @ PERSON6 then @ ORGANIZATION1, @ CAPS4, @ PERSON7. She was coming up next to my row. It was one more night. When is someone gonna pinch me gonna wake up. @ NUM3 "@ PERSON5." @ PERSON3 and with disappointed strength "@ CAPS2 did a bad set on this festival". I think you should stroke. In my mind, I was praying that she wouldn't utter the word, she replied, "@ CAPS3." When I got home, my mother got angry with the letter and accepted. Why did I have to fall into history. Next week, the or has come. We sat down, she was about to say something so I took a deep breath, just be patient and not complain. I nodded with a smile so big it looked like my lips were about to fall. @ NUM4 A few weeks later. I got a little better every day. His name was @ PERSON4. She was very kind and caring. She told me that I was making progress while waiting and seeing the results. Finally, the hundred points have arrived. I was nervous but confident at the same time. This test takes place wishing he meets me ! A week later, @ PERSON1 passed @ PERSON6, @ ORGANIZATION1, @ CAPS4 and @ PERSON7. A smile on his face good job @ PERSON5 you have an A-. It was hard begging but I was patient and got a good grade. @ NUM5 wait and don't get upset and see the results at the end. Patience has helped me because I know how to be tolerant in the future. A person who is patient is a person who achieves a goal.
Once I was patient, it was at the hairdresser. My sister, niece and I were going to the hair salon @ NUM1. I had my hair cut by an official barber. I waited until @ NUM2 to get my hair cut. It was a time when I was patient
Once I was patient it is now @ DATE1. The reason is that I am waiting for the new phone @ CAPS1. See in @ DATE2, I spelled orange juice on the phone @ CAPS1. Everyone would call me crazy and responsible. At first the @ CAPS1 phone was fine and everything was fine. Then one day the speaker @ CAPS1 stopped working. I could call anyone or listen to music. @ CAPS1's heart sank. I quickly ran over to @ CAPS1 dad and told him about the @ CAPS1 problem. He lasted at first and shook his head. Then grab the phone @ CAPS1 to test it. After disconnecting it didn't work, his face was shocked. He then asked me how it had happened. Now at the time, I was so stunned that I couldn't figure it out. Then the image of myself spilling orange juice came to my mind. Something told me to keep this from @ CAPS1 daddy. I said it anyway, and he laughed. I watched it with a why are you laughing daddy. He said, “ You're going to have to wait until I get the money. " The face of @ CAPS1 was calm but here I am still waiting on the phone.
@ PERSON1 was your fourteen-year average. @ CAPS5 had a @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 and a boring eight year old brother named @ PERSON2. Parents of @ CAPS9 were not as eligible with names. It was ?? begging from school and @ CAPS9 @ CAPS3 had to shop for clothes @ LOCATION1. The problem is that @ CAPS5 entered @ LOCATION2. @ CAPS5 wouldn't complain for a month. @ CAPS11, oh @ CAPS11, did @ CAPS5 have to be a ??! Sigh. Well, too late now. @ PERSON1 here thought that @ CAPS5 was in the boys department helping @ CAPS9 @ CAPS1 not to pick out clothes for @ ORGANIZATION1. From @ CAPS9's eye, @ CAPS5 sees becoming more, daring to see better, @ CAPS5 gasped @ CAPS5 might not have @ CAPS6 guys for school since @ CAPS9 chooses clothes in the boys department ! I looked, @ CAPS5's need is to go to the girls bathroom and stay there until @ CAPS9 gets @ CAPS9. Boldness ?? was awkward. "@ CAPS8 for being so understanding." @ CAPS9 @ CAPS1 said. "I know this has been planned for you and @ CAPS8 agot @ CAPS9 is not complaining." "@ PERSON1 what," @ CAPS8, @ CAPS10. ' @ CAPS11 being patient is a good thing. @ CAPS5 thought as @ CAPS5 was coming out of the classroom.
When I was in a store I found my friend from @ LOCATION1 and started talking to myself about being patient and hey I started talking to myself and told hem that I didn't know not what was the main one and we start to explain to me, what it was and how to start producing. Then he told me a story about it and I learned the story.
Every day I have to be patient, in fact everyone has to be patient. But have you ever been patient for a brother or sister? If so, you know how I felt when my sister didn't want to come out on her own for reasons. The other day I was trying to get my sister to go out with me because we have a special willow that we pull up anyway, I was getting off topic because she still refused to come out and do some exercice. to tell my mom, you can imagine she didn't, my sister brought a book, we attribute it and then? We came to a ??? Path??? In the middle of my next neighborhood and we parted ways, me, of course, right ??? this and had to waste as a guest house ??? have until she realizes she wants to follow her. So I was bored with the patience, but ?? ? here says it's a virtue so a guess ??? Okay with that.
I understand that patience and tolerant patients find it difficult with ??? Today would that mean patience was his ?? United States today. ?? with a ?? Tim ??? samh is and opposite today she is ??? do the ??. But she ?? a ho). ur ??. ?? she ??? (@ CAPS1
Once I was patient was when a new video game was released. I asked my dad @ CAPS1 that we could pre-order it but he said no and I had to wait until @ CAPS2. So I waited until @ CAPS2 and I still didn't get the game. So I didn't say anything about the game. It was then my birthday and I opened my last gift was the video game ! I was so excited that I gave my parents @ CAPS4 and me, my brother went to play it.
When you have patience, you are more at peace and happier. It's like when your birthday is next week and you don't want to wait for it and have to get angry if you want your presents today and not next week. But you can't, so you start hitting things crazy and you don't behave well. Then you make your parents do it, and then they bring some of your gifts back to their store, it's not patience. It's not patience when you get angry, you can't get what you want.
The key to a long road trip is to be patient. This is important because it makes the trip faster. Here is a story of how I had a great patient. @ CAPS5 was charging for a three hour trip to the water park @ CAPS1 at @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION2. Everyone's in and ready to go, except of course my parents. Who came in to check everything, got directions, called my uncle to see if @ CAPS3 was ready, and all the while we kids were sitting in the car waiting. Of course my brother @ CAPS2 was getting anxious and couldn't stop moving until @ CAPS3 couldn't take it anymore. "That's it!" @ CAPS3 exclaimed: "I'll get them!" @ CAPS3 was the least patient of all of us. Even my two little sisters had a longer patience than @ CAPS3. What does that tell you a lot? Tyler comes out @ NUM1 minutes later and announces their arrival. WRONG! They haven't been out for yet @ NUM2 minutes which made my brother crazy. " Has @ CAPS4 taken you so long ?" " @ CAPS3 asked. "@ CAPS5 had to make sure uncle @ PERSON1 was ready to go." my dad has awnsered. As soon as @ CAPS5 got under way, everyone fell asleep, accept my father who was driving. So nobody really did much. At least @ CAPS5 were all patient except for my brother @ CAPS3 who is still like that now.
Being patient is one of the many things children are taught as they grow. They are maturing and we use these life lessons and life guides when they need them. I can't tell you how many times my mom told me to be patient. It was used daily while I was growing up. I learned gradually and realized how important it is to be patient. If you are impatient, you need to understand that people are probably doing their best to finish what they are doing for you. I really found the meaning of this word when I was seven at the mall. Although I experienced this importance and knowing that I had to wait, earlier in my life it didn't mean I was happy and patient. We were shopping at my favorite store at the time called @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. I had bought a mountain of clothes as well as my sister @ PERSON1 who was @ NUM1. A locker room had finally opened after the long wait of about @ NUM2 minutes. Suddenly a locker room opened, @ ORGANIZATION1 ran into it. I was crying because I was in front of her, and it was unfair. She cut me anyway. I was the one who waited @ NUM2 minutes. After her fashion show with my mom for about @ NUM4 minutes, I was done. I wanted to try on my clothes. I knocked on the door and she told me she would move it. So I waited another @ NUM5 minutes and she was out. It was a reward for my patience which brought me into the locker room. I count on this day whether the wait is long or short, you will get what you want in the long run. So be patient, and good things will come to you like karma, what's going on, going on.
I was very patient the last time I went to the doctor, @ CAPS1 and my brother @ CAPS2 had to wait outside in the waiting room until they called us for our injections. Everyone started to take the lead as we went along and we remained patient. It got really boring to sit there, but we were patient. After about two or three hours, we weren't as patient as we were a few hours ago. So we decided to go upstairs and ask what was going on. We found out we forgot to log in and once we did, we walked in.
Being patient is waiting your turn @ CAPS1 Be clear, you don't complain about waiting like…. be patient throughout the day and wait until you leave school. Don't complain that school is too long or pretend to be sick just to get home or pretend to have pink eyes…. etc. You have to wait until the end of school Being patient is not waiting for something to happen @ CAPS1 can be about waiting in lines. Waiting to use something..Ect. Not all people are patient. I'm not very patient when @ CAPS1 arrives home on time ! I don't like to wait for people or @ CAPS2 or food ! I am very patient when @ CAPS1 comes to injections or anything related to doctors.
It was a @ DATE1 morning in wisconson, the last day of the deer hunt. I got up and dressed my dad and my friend where all sat down to eat we had pankacs and milk. Outside it was around @ NUM1 so we buttered and headed over. I was a little scary in the worst of the night because we don't know what is there or who is there. but after we entered. After @ NUM2 hours in the booth my dad tells me "@ CAPS1 it's time to come back and eat" not yet "I said" @ CAPS1 "my dad said so I guess I'll see you later so after he came back it was just around @ NUM3 when out of the bruch came the money I expected. So I bought my gun and shot it. I was never also proud of my life The @ CAPS3.
Patience, if you are a patient person, you are tolerant and understanding. There was a time when I was very patient. “@ CAPS1 can @ CAPS3 still go !?” @ CAPS2, ”she replied,“ @ CAPS3 has to buy all your school supplies. ”I still didn't like shopping for the back in. a store for @ NUM1 hours trying to find clothes, notebooks, pencil binders and pens. "@ CAPS4 I really have to go too?" "@ CAPS5 patient okay?" "@ CAPS6, have - I answered. Every time I had to get clothes or pencils, I started to be more patient. Whenever I had to wait @ CAPS1. I just sat there, I just sat and waited. And the day seemed to go a lot faster @ CAPS7 had lasted @ NUM1 hours but @ CAPS7 only seemed twenty minutes, when @ CAPS3 left. I wouldn't wait until next year, I wanted to go shopping again!
When you are patient, you have come and made no complaints. And you are understanding and tolerant. And when you are patient with something, you are stable and ???. Because you are nervous you are not, patience gives you a lot of time. And you ?? very come and stable so he is patient. And one ??? the person is having difficulty. And when is patient? waiting to get something and they didn't know ?? it's patient. And when your patience you ??? come and if you ???
Patience, having patience means that you don't complain about things that take a long time. You are tolerant or understanding. Some reasons you should @ CAPS7 patience are things like. You @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 are waiting in an extremely long queue and all the time you wait you say things like "@ CAPS1, this takes @ CAPS5. Or, “@ CAPS1, when @ CAPS3 @ CAPS6 leaves. " @ CAPS3't @ CAPS6 just @ CAPS9 ? " You think CAPS1 @ " @ CAPS4 my God, would you stop talking ? " Or she would just scream @ CAPS8. So your @ CAPS1 would probably never want @ CAPS8 to take you somewhere that involves waiting again because she knows you are @ CAPS8 impatient @ CAPS8 is handling it. Some reasons you might not want @ CAPS8 to be patient or you might not want @ CAPS8 to be hospitalized could be like having a meeting with your teacher and being late you would have @ CAPS7 a bad first impression So your @ CAPS1 takes @ CAPS5 on the phone so you keep saying, '' @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 ! " @ CAPS10 you are very impatiently waiting. Although patience is basically a kind and gentle way of waiting. Even if inside you imagine yourself yelling at someone you are expecting. Where outside, you patiently wait. So having patience is a good thing. Try, sometimes don't let your inner feelings tear up what is going on on the outside.
Patience is when you expect something. When you rush, it's not being patient. When you're patient, you don't rush. @ CAPS1 is another meaning of patience when you keep calm i.e. patience does not get angry. Some people say they are losing @ CAPS1's patience, which means @ CAPS1 is about to get angry. Those the meaning of patience @ CAPS1 was a time when I was patience. I'm waiting for @ CAPS2 to come. I wait, I wait, I wait, I didn't rush, they say @ CAPS2 is @ CAPS4's birthday. In the bible it says to be patient and I did. We didn't know when @ CAPS2 was coming, I'm still waiting and finally! @ CAPS2 has come.
One time I was patient was when @ CAPS1 came up. And I was hungry so I went inside and asked when was dinner @ CAPS2 ? And @ CAPS3 and time.
Being patient is a valve. Here is a story about patience. Once upon a time there was a little girl named @ PERSON1. She lived with her uncle named @ ORGANIZATION1. One day @ PERSON1 decided to go out and play. She told her uncle that she would be in the woods that day and that she wouldn't worry about her. @ ORGANIZATION1 tells her to be careful and watch everything for the evil witch. @ PERSON1 jumps into the woods. When @ PERSON1 arrives in the woods, she is heading to her favorite place, the tree that her uncle built for her about a year ago. When she got there, she climbed to the top and opened the door. Waiting for him inside was not at all what she expected. There sat the wicked with it. When @ PERSON1 didn't come home that night, the uncle started to worry. He looked for her and looked for her but found nothing. He tried to be patient but it was difficult. The next day, @ PERSON1's uncle was arrested because the police believed he had kidnapped: @ PERSON1. He had to be patient again. Eventually the police found the witch and @ PERSON1 too and @ PERSON1's uncle's patience paid off, he was free. Since that day @ ORGANIZATION1 has had patience. This is a time when Uncle @ ORGANIZATION1 is patient.
This week I have been very patient. I really wanted a Wii and no one would buy me one. So I saved my money for so long. Then I had to wait for what looked like weeks was @ NUM1 days (@ NUM2 weeks). I was counting the days. It just made it feel longer. So I decided to tell myself that I didn't want it so I wasn't looking forward to having it. This kind of work. But when I got it to tell you the truth, it wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be.
In my opinion, I am a very hospitalized person. Anytime I ask someone to stop doing something they better stop it right away or @ PERSON1 I note the kid makes a huge breakthrough, too I'm not a of these children who are waiting for dinner, I nibble my way! and when i'm in school i just @ caps1 listening to the meap instructions for hours. It reminds me, my teacher is driving me crazy.! He has absolutely no patience whatsoever. If we make a noise, it immediately goes wild! Overall, I think people need more patience these days.
Patience is a very good thing that I and a lot of people lack. One person who doesn't lack patience is the head coach of @ LOCATION1 @ ORGANIZATION4 @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 has been very patient over the past two years. He didn't try to make his team better than they were, he just made them try their @ CAPS2 and see what the end result was. The @ ORGANIZATION4 ended up becoming @ NUM1 that year and by securing the second worst national record @ ORGANIZATION3 they got the second pick in the twenty trends @ ORGANIZATION6 draft. In this draft, @ ORGANIZATION4 removed @ ORGANIZATION5 a defensive lineman from @ ORGANIZATION2. He's an exceptional player and the other choice of @ ORGANIZATION4 was a fast running back named @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 of @ ORGANIZATION1. The @ PERSON1 team is so good this year because of @ PERSON1's patience with his team and his understanding of his player's talents.
Who likes to be patient it is so boring. Almost all it does is waste your time. But we all know it is good to be patient and to have patience. I'm not really a patient person, but there are a lot of times I've had to be patient. When I was @ NUM1, I lived at @ LOCATION1 with a family of six without me. I really liked video games and have @ NUM2 older brothers and @ NUM2 younger sisters. We only had one video game station. It was the game's cube. Also, we only had one controller. It was really hard to be patient to take your turn because my older brothers would always play first and they would never get out of it. But there was once that was tougher than all the others. I have a brand new video game called @ PERSON1 bros and I couldn't wait to play it. But when I got home, my brothers snatched it from my hands and ran upstairs to play it. I was really sad and angry, but I didn't complain, I just sat right behind the door to the room they were in. I sat there with tears in my eyes. I felt empty but still wasn't complaining. I ended up sitting there for @ NUM4 hours. Finally, my brother opened the door and said I could go in. Not in a very nice way, but I got to play. I still remember today how difficult it was, but afterwards it was worth it. So sometimes when you have to wait to do something that you really really want to do and can't do it, just be patient and it will pay off.
One time I was patient was when my sister broke my futon. It was the day I got it and I was in the living room watching a movie when all of a sudden I heard "@ CAPS1, @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1, boom, crack!" I ran upstairs to find out what had happened and saw my sister on the bed, and my other sister standing there pale as a ghost. I was patient in not yelling at them. I soon had another futon that is not broken and now my sisters know not to mess around with things that can break! And this is my story of how I once showed patience!
One day, as I was walking aside, I found a snake on a rock. I cried out for my big brother who was playing his game. He said ' Wait I have to beat the leavie ' but the snake was getting eradicated he said , 'now garrid his departure finally after ten minutes he came out of the house and looked at what I had in my hand. He asked me "why do you have a snake", I replied "I saw him cool". he loved me and let it go.
One night, while me, @ CAPS1 and my sister @ CAPS9, @ PERSON1, were sleeping. Our parents were on the computer. @ CAPS4 usually doesn't stay awake that late. So I just thought @ CAPS2 was doing something for the job. In @ TIME1, when we woke up, @ CAPS9 mom and @ CAPS2 were standing in the kitchen with smiles on their faces. @ CAPS2 was holding something behind his back. "I wonder @ CAPS3 that could be ..." I thought. I asked @ CAPS9 mom "@ CAPS3 is happening !?!" @ CAPS4 didn't say anything, but @ CAPS9 @ CAPS2 slowly made a document appear behind his back as he presented it to us. The document header read "@ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8". @ CAPS9's parents smirked @ CAPS11 @ CAPS9 sister and I looked at myself in amazement. @ CAPS11 if we read our minds we both knew we were going on a cruise ! I smiled enthusiastically and looked at the @ CAPS15 on the paper. "@ DATE2 @ NUM1 - @ DATE2. '' He said. Today was @ DATE1. I said to @ CAPS9 @ CAPS2" It's like, in two months !!!. " " @ CAPS10 ", @ CAPS9 @ CAPS2 said," You must be patient. "@ CAPS11 normal children did. I said" @ CAPS12 ... "@ CAPS9 @ CAPS2 knew of @ CAPS9's disappointment and I says "@ CAPS14 things happen to those who wait. I nodded in satisfaction. I knew I was going to have to go through the tough two months and be patient. The first two weeks seemed like hills to us. We were so anxious @ CAPS11, you will guess. But, @ CAPS11 the time has progressed, the patient has become easier. I was able to focus on other things besides the cruise. On <@ NUM2 @ NUM1, @ DATE3 </ @ CAPS15>, the time has come for us to get on the plane for the cruise. "It's fast ! It's gone so fast ! I'm so excited, @ CAPS2 I said when we got on the plane, "I'm proud of you, son. You, we are patient ! "That's when I learned to be patient ! @ CAPS11 @ CAPS9 @ CAPS2 says, " @ CAPS14, things will happen to those who wait. "
I will tell you about a time when I was patient. a time when i was patient was when i had to save my money to get the new gaming halo scope. i had to order it in advance with my money so i did a bunch of work so i cut the lawn in my house, then i cut other people's lawns for two dollars, so i did that for about two months at the end. I ended up with three hundred dollars. I pre-ordered and they told me I had to wait three weeks so I did. I waited and bought some more stuff with the remaining money and the game finally arrived in the mail. it's a time when I use patients to wait for something.
Once upon a time there was a girl. She was very impatient until she was taught to be patient. One day, @ PERSON1 was going to get his driver's license. She was there and was so excited to be able to drive. When @ PERSON1 got to the permit, she saw that there were a lot of people waiting. She estimated that there were about @ NUM1 people, "@ CAPS1 must be that many people here," she thought. After about @ NUM2 minutes of waiting she went crazy @ CAPS6 as only one person graduated during the period. She had a big seizure right there. " Ugh ! I had to take my license today, not wait for a group of experienced adults to renew their license ! " She started talking and said. " @ CAPS1 are you taking that long !" You are so slow! " She got home and started talking to her faend @ CAPS3 on her cell phone. " @ CAPS2 there were a lot of people i will never get my license @ CAPS3! " " @ PERSON1 calm down. Stop being so impatient. "@ CAPS4 the line was so long and. '@ PERSON2 cut @ PERSON1. " @ CAPS5 you keep coming home crying, you will never get your license. The queue for a driver's license is still long. I had to wait @ NUM2 hours to get mine. "@ CAPS6 five o'clock!" “@ CAPS7, @ CAPS4 Took @ NUM4 hours with me so as not to get bored. Take your phone with you. ” @ CAPS8, '' @ PERSON1 replied. The next day, she returned to the permit office, took her phone and a book with her. While she was waiting, she texted her friend, went online, and read her book for her book project. She kept moving forward in the @ CAPS4 line, she didn't even realize @ CAPS11. @ PERSON1 waited @ NUM5 hours that day @ CAPS4, she only thought @ CAPS11 was @ NUM4 because she was concerned. @ PERSON1 felt good when she finally got her bachelor's degree, she was the second in school to get her bachelor's degree (after @ PERSON2). “@ CAPS9 @ PERSON2, you taught me to be patient and calm down.” “@ CAPS10 problem, @ CAPS11 is the least I can do for my best friend.
Being patient means being understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulty without complaining. Once I was patient was when my parents didn't know it was half a day at school. One day in elementary school, we had a half day that parents did not know. After school I waited in the parking lot for almost @ NUM1 minutes while waiting for my parents to pick me up. I was starting to think my parents wouldn't come until a teacher asked me what I was doing. After I explained my situation, the teacher let me call my parents. My father had a appogized and went myself to look after I explained that I could finally go home.
I have been patented many times, but when I ordered a new game console I had to be patient. My dad and I had a game console that would be on our porch in two weeks. For me it was like a lifetime, but I had to be patient. I didn't complain during those fourteen days, neither did my father. when it happened it was definitely worth the wait. It was a time when you had to have patience and not complain.
A time when I was skating was when I was at the fastifal. I wanted to eat something and the queue was big. Another time, when I wanted to take a ride, the line was giant. It was for the pirate ship @ CAPS1, @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS2, the swing. There was a queue to play this game of basketball, it was big.
Have you ever had enough patients to deal with @ NUM1 screaming children . I can proudly say that I can. It all started when my uncle steve and @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1 decided to move to @ LOCATION1. They needed a lot of help so my @ CAPS1 @ DATE1 decided to take her five children, my sister and I to @ LOCATION1 to help them out. The only problem was where @ NUM2 children and only @ NUM3 her. So we packed all of our bags and left. My @ CAPS1 @ DATE1 has an expedition car for all @ NUM2 of us to come home. But it didn't take long for everyone to feel uncomfortable. Everyone starts to feel overwhelmed and to get very hot. So all the @ NUM1 children start to fight. My @ CAPS1 @ DATE1 got very stressed very quickly. Thank God there is at least one @ CAPS5.V in this car. But I was sitting in the front so I didn't @ CAPS5 get to watch it. After about @ NUM1 hours, I had had enough. My legs were all getting cramped and the constant movement made me dizzy. By this time we had driven about @ NUM7 hours, having only one rest stop. It was dark now. We were the only ones on the road at the moment. I sagged lower in my seat. Then @ CAPS6. Everyone shouted, even my @ CAPS1 @ DATE1. At first I thought we had a car accident, but when I opened my eyes I was alive. We had run into a deer. He slipped on the hood of the car! Finally, after about @ NUM8 hours, we reached @ LOCATION2 @ NUM9. It was @ NUM10 in the morning ! I ended up surprised by the number of patients I had. After that, I don't think I want to go on a roadtrip again.
Patience is when you have problems and don't complain. It takes patience in an amusement park to stand in line. Patience doesn't complain of being embarked on a long drive. You have to be patient to fish or be rewarding and this can save headaches for others. You always want to be stressed if you are patient. So you always have to be patient, it can make your life so much easier. Long lines won't look that long. The fishing is very rewarding for the patina.
Patients' day. I remember when I was patient for a small car. Four @ CAPS1 that I hate to wait for @ NUM1 whole days. Every day I felt like I was in prison. So I got angry every day slapping people in the face it was so funny my @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 was mad at me. then my mother put me in punishment. Then a few days later, I was doing well in school. So my mom was so proud of me. Then she fought me a lot of things. Later that Christmas day we had a turkey ranch dressing. Then I open my presents. I have the toy car, @ NUM2, the monster truck car shoes and the blue, red necklaces, @ CAPS4 from @ ORGANIZATION1 that you can think of. This is why I have been patient with this toy. I was so happy and my @ CAPS5 stopped and gave me @ NUM3 dallers. Then he got me ice cream @ CAPS6 shade for those skinny breasts. But everything went well for me at the end. I have everything I wanted and I want a charge button with the @ NUM3 @ CAPS7. I felt like I was rich for Christmas Day.
One day it was this girl from @ CAPS3 who really wanted to go shopping to school at @ CAPS3 had to wait because her mom said @ CAPS3 isn't getting her money now @ CAPS3 got it over late in @ CAPS1 her mom said wait tell this last @ CAPS3 didn't know now her new stuff was in her room so when her mom came back @ CAPS3 said we were going to go @ CAPS1 her mother said to go get the jacket upstairs in her bedroom. @ CAPS3 went upstairs to get his jacket when @ CAPS3 went up to his room @ CAPS3 saw new clothes in five new shoes and @ CAPS3 had shouted in @ CAPS3 came down the stairs saying to his mother thank you @ CAPS3 Said you were welcome @ CAPS1 his mom said i told you i was gonna put your stuff in @ CAPS3 said you just had to wait for payhent.
Patience is a feeling you feel when you encounter a difficult task and do your best to overcome without complaining about the task, such as when you remove the paint and that you press and it will not come out, but you continue to try until you understand he's gone. Then you are going to get a new bottle to start using. I wish more people were patient, so we wouldn't give in to the constant complaints.
A time when I had to be patient was when I had to? my little brothers and my two cousins. It was going to take a lot of patience. One day, I received a phone call from my aunt. She said she needed a ??? babysitting for my cousins for two years and seven years . she said she would pay me if i wanted ?? them. So I said of course. I hut n I did it ?? I was embarking. Some days my mom ??? (@ CAPS1) @ CAPS2 turned out to be good for me after all.
Patience is probably one of the hardest things to do in the world. I once remember when I was patient was when my family and I went to point @ CAPS1. When we went to point @ CAPS1 we were all ready to ride the magnum, which we never got to ride the last time we were there. So we planned to do this first. We stood in line after a little while we had to wait for the rain to stop - the wait was an hour and fifteen minutes. So I decided to be a little more patient and not to complain. Although not being able to sit up after a while becomes a little sore, but I still did not complain. A little later I started to forget I was online because people started to let us in more. Guess not complaining works because my whole family was in a good mood after we got off the ride. So I decided to learn to be a little more patient with people because of the quality of it all until we got to the bumper cars.
While waiting in the double doors @ LOCATION1 of the fravential, I'm @ CAPS1 by a man in a suit, "welcome to the fravsthat" man ??? as soon as we enter we can walk further to the ??? ??? in front of us. " When does the show start ?" " I asked excitedly. “@ CAPS2 until about @ NUM1. ” My mother replies. Half past eight was about one o'clock and we couldn't sit down due to the crowds in front of us. @ NUM2 minutes pass and @ CAPS2 someone has been admitted to the show. @ CAPS2 even elegant music could mask the tumult of the crowd. Another @ NUM3 minutes passes and our places are finally waiting for us. As I walk down the path, I get comfortable in the @ NUM4 seat at the start of the show.
Being patient is sometimes a difficult character trait. @ CAPS1 is also a good choice, @ CAPS1 can help you in many situations. If the gas has patience, you won't be nervous or anxious about something. I was patient when I had to wait a week for a birthday present my friend @ PERSON1 was giving me. I haven't really thought about @ CAPS1 so @ CAPS1 hasn't really touched me. I knew @ CAPS1 was going to be really cool which made the patience a little harder. I was still able to keep @ CAPS1 out of my mind. I had to make sure I didn't think of @ CAPS1, so I wouldn't beg my friend to know what @ CAPS1 was, because that would be impatient. If your impatient people might be annoyed because you'll always be asking questions and getting upset. @ CAPS1 is good to be patient with friendships so you don't get mean to them or someone else. @ CAPS1's @ CAPS2 is not good for being impatient with your family. If this is your patient, you can work things out better and stay more focused and focused on your task.
When you are in a store or at the doctor or anywhere you are expecting something, you must always have patience or you will never be able to do anything. I remember when I was in the store with my mother, we had to wait in the long queue waiting just to do some shopping, but if we had no patience challenging ourselves and our things were returning to the house, but we felt like we had patience. buy are stuff. Therefore, if you don't have it, you won't be able to do what you want.
Here is a story about when I was patient. So the story begins at the art award and I loved seeing the beautiful art there, but I was dying to see the winning photo for the art award. My parent told me to wait until we all saw the rest of the amazing art from the art prize. So I signed and said ok, we can see the rest of the art prizes first. While we were looking at the art all the time, I was thinking about the winning piece. That's all I thought. ??? A little later. I thought what a blessing it is to be here at the cost of art. So I checked and said patience is good. And if you wait for something for a while, it's all soggy, it feels more valuable. A few hours later I started heading for the car and my mom interrupted me and said, "@ CAPS1, don't you want to see the winning artwork ?" “@ CAPS2 yes I forget.” @ CAPS3 there is no row now, so when we go to see it, there was no row. I was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It was a picture of sergeants drawn from a simple pencil. That day I learned that the patient is important because it is worth the wait to see something you like.
One time someone else I knew was patient was when I was trying to have a sleepover with my friend @ CAPS1. My parents ordered pizza for me and my two brothers because they went out for their birthday dinner. It was around @ NUM1 pm when they left, and we just started digging into the deep dish @ CAPS2's pizza. In the middle of dinner, I got a text from my next door neighbor, ??? my best friend, asking if I wanted to do a slumber party. I responded by saying my parents are out they will be back in a few hours I will ask later. @ CAPS6 finally around @ NUM2 pm my parents came home and I asked about the sleepover. She said, “I don't know. And walked away. About an hour later, I got my answer. It was a yes! I texted @ CAPS1 and said I can. She replied “finally! @ CAPS4 I had to pack my bags. @ CAPS6 I went to my room and got everything I would need for a sleepover. I was about to go out when my mom yelled from upstairs, “@ CAPS5! I need you to get the dogs out before I go! @ CAPS6 I dropped everything, put the leashes on the dogs and stood outside in the pouring rain waiting for them to finish. When they were done, I grabbed my things and ran for the door before she made me do anything else. When I got to @ CAPS7's house, she opened the door and let me in. I said, "@ CAPS8 this took @ CAPS6 a long time. Thanks for being patient @ CAPS6 ! "
I don't have a moment where I'm patient, so today I'm going to write how impatient I am. I thank you one day I was in a long line to look. (@ ORGANIZATION1). It was a hot day and I was ready to move to my big, cool house to relax and unwind. You all know how old people are, they walk slowly and talk a lot. If you already notice. @ NUM1 of these people were in front of me. He takes all day pulling out his wallet and talks a lot. So I said "you know what I'm just gonna go to another @ ORGANIZATION1 and do a slippery rite knowing I can't stand this slow or wet day" and left.
Being patient can be really difficult at times, especially when everything you are patient for is really distracting and painful. This is the story of how I had to be patient when I fell outside and ??? myself. One day my brother and I were playing outside. We were throwing balls of water mchother. I was already soaked from head to toe but we continued to play. Suddenly I heard a buzz near my ear. I turned around and saw a huge being next to me. I was only NUM1 years old and was very scared of bees. I turned and walked down the aisle and I continued to walk around the house, thinking bee I always followed . I was starting to get tired so I tripped and fell, scratching a fair amount of skin in the process. I immediately started to organize myself when I saw blood coming from ??? Inside to tell my mom. "@ CAPS1 ! I fell!" I managed to cry out between sobs. "@ CAPS2 my God ! Let me go get some bandages, my mother replied. The pain was intolerable for my little body. I kept crying in silence but I knew I had to be patient while my mother went. looking for bandages. Just @ DATE1, I wasted a layer of bandages plastering them on a cross in my face. I had to be patient and ??? For a long time, until my mom usually found the bandages . I found them! " my mom said while going down the ??? In the / WAS setting. "@ CAPS3, are you so patient?" @ CAPS4 stock the tape helps get through the cut on my leg and then gave me a pacifier. I know I had been a good girl by being patient.
Yo ! I'm the narrator… you know the guy who tells the story, well I'll tell you a story about patience. Ok so there was this armadillo. Its name is @ CAPS1. Now @ CAPS1 is no ordinary armadillo. @ CAPS1 was an armadillo without a shell. All the other armadillos laughed at him and told him to take a shell. So @ CAPS1 being the smart @ CAPS1, he thought about this idea and decided to create his own shell. @ CAPS1 went to the scrapyard to find things to help him make his shell. He found a lot of light metal, so he took it home, melted it down, and began the long process of forging the metal from its shell. After his shell was finished, he tried it on and it was snug. The next day he went to school and everyone was so impressed and it was super brilliant. @ CAPS1 was no longer laughing. @ CAPS1 had to be patient to make his shell!
Being patient is a very difficult thing to do. A lot of people cannot be patient. For example my brother. Whether he's ordering something online or waiting for dinner to be cooked, he always needs to know when he's going to get what he wants. I'm not like that. In fact, I have patience. For example, I needed shoes, so I searched the internet to see if I could get a good deal. I was looking at the store @ ORGANIZATION1 when I saw these great shoes. I asked my dad if I could order them online. So the next day my mom ordered them online, I was so excited I waited and waited. After three days, I missed my school bus. My mom had to go to college and she couldn't drop me off. So I was left home alone. I found out that my dad was coming home that day and the house was in a mess. So I started cleaning. My mother came home and saw a box lying on the front. She picked it up and opened the box and saw my shoes were in there ! I went to greet him and saw my shoes there. I jumped in excitement and put them on and it was a perfect fit. My mom walked into the room and said they had to arrive on @ DATE1 but since you were patient they got there early.
I never folded a "patient" person @ CAPS1 this girl I know @ PERSON1 she is always patient like the time I was scared to sleigh down the hill and I wouldn't go down the hill I just kept to say “I'm not going down the hill.” @ CAPS1 about @ NUM1 min later she was still patent, she said “@ CAPS2 I get my fist down, then you come down.” I said yeah so she fell that I fell. And and on dance day for the last few years I was taking so long getting dressed we were all late @ CAPS1 she was so patient I was so crazy I think she has an excess of patients .. Hope this rubs off on me because I need it and ASAP and a lot because I bet she is the only person in the world with no patiets wow !.
One rainy day my father's leg was hurting him. He took a doctor but it didn't work so we took him to Coro hospital. They looked at his leg and told us we had to go to Covent Hospital at @ LOCATION1 so we set off for @ LOCATION1. When we got to the hospital it was like @ NUM1 people in the waiting room. My father had the patience to wait. When we had to enter the room. My father must have taken x-rays. He also had enough patience to wait and see what was wrong. When he found out what was wrong. He had to wait even longer to see if he should have surgery on his legs after having all the patience he needed to have surgery. He had enough patience to have surgery. It's a good thing my dad had all the patience because his legs are all better. I didn't think my dad had enough patience.
I 'm patient all even this year for @ CAPS1 if I can get some @ CAPS2. I was buying @ CAPS2 but can not buy more because @ CAPS1 is coming than the reason I half be patient because he sees more if I envy gets a lot of excitement. Every day is patient sometimes I can't wait to get out of school so that I can play. I always try to be patient because it's party after party, each one gets more exciting. Every child tries, but being patient is one of the hardest things to do. Because I am patient, I act as if nothing exciting is happening.
Today was a thank you. We had to drive up ??? to visit my cousins. The car was making an @ NUM1 trip. But the patience was hard, I would have liked to buy a plane ticket, I saw some cool things. I ??? for there we to leave the highway ??? and we were ??? With the family we sat down we gave gifts with @ CAPS1 a turkey @ CAPS2. ??? illegible
On the way to @ STATE1 I was patient as I had to wait for the buses. Me too ??? On some stops ?? bus @ NUM1 it o @ CAPS1 hes to got ??? these haves I was so tired that ?? the bus got on I fell asleep.
Today was the last day of testing. The decisive day. We have completed the trials. I patiently waited for @ CAPS2 to distribute the envelopes to all the @ NUM1 girls. I didn't know if I could handle this. “@ CAPS1 until you have left the building to open your envelope,” @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1 said. “ The only fair of @ CAPS3. If everyone opens them up here, people who aren't on the team will be sad and disappointed, while the girls who did would jump for joy, which would make the girls who didn't made @ CAPS3 feel even more disappointed and left out. Please be patient and @ CAPS1 until you leave the building. she called my name. I came over and grabbed my envelope. She fired us. Some girls opened their envelopes right away. But they didn't @ CAPS3.karma. I waited until I was outside. I could barely @ CAPS1. I needed to know but I had to @ CAPS1. Patience is not always such a beautiful thing. I opened my envelope. I made the team! I was so excited and glad I had the patience of @ CAPS1 and to be surprised.
It was my family vacation, we were going to point @ CAPS1. We were in the magical hotel which was, it was beautiful, you can see a real waterfall and it's like a haven. We were in this huge room with @ NUM1 huge bathroom and large @ CAPS2. Then looking out the window I can see rolercoster and all kinds of rides. But they came up with these call the breaker @ CAPS3: he @ NUM2 one hundred feet tall and big like libaty's statin and he knocks you down, you @ NUM2 one hundred feet twist like one! Tarnado. It moves from side to side. Me and my mom and dad went there, we want to ride. But @ NUM4 people are lining up. My parents weren't used to doing a different trick, but I wanted to. So i got in line and waited i knew i had to be patient but @ NUM1 hours go by i start to lose my patient. There were only @ NUM6 people in front of me. Finally it was my turn, I got on it, the first one left me @ NUM7 cents. Feet and fall me, twirl, twist until I got tired and finally I got out of it. You can see me cry but it wasn't a bad cry it was a good cry so that was the moment I was patient
I stomp on the elevator, soft jazz music buzzing through the speakers above me. Eventually the all-too-familiar click was the head and the slick metal doors opened to reveal a well-furnished hallway with many other people waiting @ CAPS6 for their turn to start on ??? I slipped away, now trying to be trampled on by the massive crowd, then silence. My footsteps echoed on the ??? while I was looking for @ CAPS6 room @ NUM1. Having finally found my destination, I open the door and walk inside where many other restless children are waiting. I take off my coat and hang it on a nearby hook, trying not to draw too much attention to myself. I continue searching the magazines section, the ripped magazines @ CAPS1 and the delicately manipulated sports pictured are flipped through until I find an interesting article on swimming. Magazines under my arm, I choose a seat in the far corner to wait. The minutes go by, I can tell the child next to me is quickly getting impatient, he repeatedly taps his mother's jacket and asks the same thing he did @ NUM2 minutes ago, "@ CAPS2 how much longer? " The mother looks at her watch and replies in a tone of narrow annoyance:" It's not very long now my dear ". @ CAPS3, the little boy collapses in his seat and puts his thumb in his mouth to occupy it. I roll my eyes, but I can't help but smile at his actions. Somewhere across the room, a girl my age frowns as @ CAPS5 texts her cell phone, after a quick glance at the clock @ CAPS5 frowns and continues. At that moment, the glass door opens and a woman with a homemade perm and tired eyes comes out. Across the waiting room, the patients stare at her, their eyes full of anticipation and hope. @ PERSON1, the doctor is ready to see you now. @ CAPS4, I avoid the glares of the other patients and follow her to the door. "You know it's funny," @ CAPS5 said, snapping his eraser tightly. "@ CAPS6 someone. So young you were the most patient person ever! I just nod and smile because I understand that patient people go through hard times without complaining and I am so grateful to be a patient person. stand in the
One day my brother, my mother and I were going to the doctor because my brother was sick. When we got to the doctor and sat down in the waiting room. They called my mom and my brother. So I had to stay. My mom said it would only take two minutes. Guess what she was wrong. It took him two hours to come back. So while I was patient, I texted my aunt and friends. I also played a few games. I actually brought my @ CAPS1 with me. So I waited and waited. I was so bored that I went out for some fresh air. Then I got tired, just sat there. Finally they left. Guess what my mom said "how are you honey" then my mom told me my brother was sick. I was so patient we were able to eat at @ ORGANIZATION1. after the ??? I was patient at the clinic so we spent @ NUM1 minutes. So here is me ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?? to sleep. I was ??? ??? Because I was patient, isn't that it ??? to believe ??? it's actually easy. It's a ???
Patience is when you're in line at the grocery store while you're waiting for a new video game. This happened to me when I was on the big trip to California. Had to do six really long queues until @ NUM1 hours it took forever to get to the plain when we finally got there we were hungry so we had to wait in line for @ NUM2 minutes when we were finally up to get our food we were starving we ate and went to a friends house we stayed for an hour it started to see itself - but i had patience and waited for it turns out it wasn't that bad after all. Being patient is an important thing in life whether or not you are patient, it is up to you to decide this week was all about the patients and the queues, it has been a long day. Unfortunately, we had to leave after that day which equals. Yap, you guessed it, for patience we had to go to Huston, TX first, then @ ORGANIZATION1, then we had to drive @ NUM3 hours to get home. When we returned home, we were so tired and have passed the story to my friends and family.
To be considered patient, you must be tolerant and understanding, and you cannot complain. I like to babysit my little cousin, especially when they are still young. This @ DATE1, I went to my cousin's house to watch her daughter @ CAPS1 '@ PERSON1, for about three hours. I was paid fifty dollars and couldn't wait. When I got to their place @ NUM1 was asleep and I woke her up as soon as her mom left. As soon as I did that I thought it was a bad idea that she started screaming at the top of her lungs. I picked her up, rocked her, played games, put her in the swing and even tried to feed her but nothing worked. I was so upset that I wanted to scream. The baby cried for an hour and a half and didn't want to shut up. Then I said: “@ NUM1, what's wrong?” @ CAPS2 I spoke, there was a moment of silence, she had stopped crying. At that point I realized I was patient as I stayed a bit calm and didn't complain to mum about @ CAPS1 '@ CAPS4.
Every year since I learned about @ LOCATION1 and freebies, come to think of it, they never said you have to wait months until @ CAPS1 comes along. I like @ CAPS1 but once a year or so @ CAPS2 is patient enough to wait @ DATE1 down. The first @ DATE2 of @ DATE1 told me that @ CAPS1 comes with everything we decorate, sing and mix for joy @ CAPS1. I usually try to pass the time by having snowball wars with my cousins. I still feel the temptation to try to rush time and make myself anxious and exhausting to wait so long, but @ CAPS2 is still patient and tries to let the temptation go. When @ CAPS1 the day before arrived I feel grateful that I spent so much time with the patients because @ CAPS2 just like my parents and I can't wait for everything that takes a month. Then it comes in as slowly as it can and leaves faster, so I could think how fast it went. Much like the talk time file sometimes having a fan.
Once when I was a little boy, about seven years old, I was extremely patient about a @ CAPS1 toy that I wanted. Since @ CAPS1 The @ CAPS3 @ ORGANIZATION1 bender was on TV and in stories now I was crazy about it and I'm still today the @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 the only person in the world @ CAPS1 who can master the four elements @ CAPS7, @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS8, @ ORGANIZATION1. Now I can write you a whole book on @ CAPS1. So I saw a @ CAPS1 put on TV so I asked my mom if she could buy it. And she said when I got the money, but until then no. so of course I was pissed off. So I waited to count until the days were gone by buying. Then final that very @ CAPS12 came along, and you know what that means. "@ CAPS11 @ CAPS12" the @ CAPS12 arrived on @ CAPS12 I got my toy but didn't know it only had two hundred dollars so I had to wait another week. I was so upset that I ran up the stairs, locked my door, and cried to fall asleep. My birthday was approaching. I was so upset that I forgot everything about @ CAPS12 and when my birthday was here you can guess what…? I finally had the best of all. The @ CAPS4 and my mom said every patient you've had got what you wanted.
The patient is like you're waiting for something and you don't complain that it's taking too long, and you just sit there and wait quietly. Here is an example. I was waiting one time to go to the doctors for a check-up, and you were setting there quietly reading a magazine and setting there. There is an example on patience
One day a kid was going to school @ CAPS4 was going to hand in a math homework @ CAPS2 @ CAPS4 did it. During @ CAPS1, @ CAPS4 was doing a chapter sketch. His teacher called him. The professor said you have a page from a story that was due a month ago. @ CAPS4 said "no" the teacher asked "why" the kid said "because I went to a basketball tournament". the teacher said " you have to say it tomorrow ". @ CAPS2 the next day the child is in class @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 said "I'm @ CAPS2 sorry I don't have my paper." the teacher asked " why " " because my grandfather died ". the teacher said " ok tomorrow ". @ CAPS2 the kid has made his paper.
I have been patient many times in my life, but this time around it was really hard to be patient because I was so excited to build. Left within my reach, we had been planting it for a while now and we started a @ DATE1 after school ended, we did half of it that day, but there we couldn't work on it for a while. week because my brother, sister, dad and mom all had ?? Where ?? So I had to wait a week to work on it again. It was really hard to be patient this time because I had been waiting to do this for a while. After a week finally passed it felt like a month, but now I could finish my job and I was so excited. A few days later we finally finished the blue and gold painted walls for you from @ CAPS1 and my left as all we had to do was put my dad on my left and then he was ready to sleep. I was so happy that we had I finally finished my room and was able to sleep in it.
Once I was patient, I saved up to buy a game. The name of the litter was halo. I had to wait @ NUM1 weeks to get it. But I was patient by waiting all the time and not asking over and over again.
The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 a few days after @ CAPS18 started working, @ CAPS3 a small anxious chestnut room @ CAPS1 saw her @ CAPS5 plow a large oval and cover it with @ CAPS4 looked like dust. "@ CAPS4 makes @ CAPS5, @ CAPS6?" @ CAPS7 a very curious @ CAPS3. "The plowing of @ CAPS9." @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11, @ CAPS17 young horses. "@ CAPS12 will be competing in a race called @ ORGANIZATION1 next year and that's how @ CAPS18 will train." I want to run! "yelled @ CAPS3 with enthusiasm" Patience my dear, you are not even a filly! "@ CAPS10 @ CAPS11, conclusively. And so @ CAPS3 waited patiently for weeks. When @ CAPS18 could @ CAPS18 ran the track at night. @ CAPS18 counted his times and @ CAPS18 got faster and stronger . Two years later @ CAPS3 was the champion reached for @ NUM1 years in the rough. "@ CAPS17 was right ! "@ CAPS18 asserted" Patience is the key !
"@ CAPS1 have you already purchased @ CAPS10 ?" I shouted across the room "@ CAPS2 can't get @ CAPS10 @ CAPS4 yet" my dad replied. I was buying a soot on the internet and @ CAPS10 was being shipped from @ LOCATION1. @ CAPS10 said the scooter will get it in five to eight business days. "@ CAPS3" I shouted while buying @ CAPS10 "@ CAPS4 just wait. The next morning I woke up at six in the morning to take the bus to go to school during my lessons , all I could think of were the scooters. Patience @ CAPS5- patience, I thought. After school I would go to the closed country until @ NUM1 when my parents pick me up. Five working days are finally arrived "I can't wait any longer" I shouted. After a country near my mom brought me home and I wrote on the main box " Darm @ CAPS10 ! " I said "@ CAPS6 yeah the website tried to charge extra money on our credit card so we had to cancel @ CAPS10. "@ CAPS7 @ CAPS5" my mom said "let you buy a new one" "@ CAPS8" The @ CAPS9 scooter finally arrives three days later. "@ CAPS10 is about time," I said happily.
Once when I was at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I had to wait around @ NUM1 hours to get on the best thrill dragster. I was so patient because this was my first time riding the dragster. My father and I waited and waited. When we got to row one I was so scared I was going to pee in my pants. When we got on the roller coaster, I said I didn't want to go. So my dad asked if my son could go down a roller coaster and they said when you go up you can't go down. So I had to ride it and when I did I wanted to go back again and again. Even though this was a second @ NUM2 ride, it was the best thing I had ever expected in my life so far. That's when I had to be patient to get something I really wanted.
It was patient to wait to go to @ CAPS1. He went through @ NUM1 rendezvous. It was so excited and the ladies had to wait patiently and do many achievements and other activities respectively. On that is to say could offer everything, do especially new ??? delusional parents scream "at me and ??? you go against the systems. I'm going to have to be patient. I'm going to be working all night in stride ??? do you note a @ CAPS2. it worked ??? days and prepare everything else in the meat of @ LOCATION1. Sitting because so vast will be then with @ NUM2th, ???
Do you know someone who is patient? I do my mother is changeable patient with us kids. When I come to blow my top my mom is always cool. All the time my little brother drives me so crazy that I can't stand it. But she hardly finished is like that. Even when my grandmother died, she remained calm. Two of my ants come from pitcher. down that week. But it's okay now. Every everyday thing does not vary it. When my sister drives her crazy, she always regrets it. I want to hit her when she drives mum crazy because it turns me off, she cracks. As you can see, my mother mushrooms her patients so well.
My friend was waiting @ NUM1 hours to talk to my dad, my dad was busy fixing his @ CAPS1. He waited, waited and waited until he fixed it. I was wondering what the question was. He was sitting inside, watching TV while he waited for him to finish. Then my dad was done so my friends asked if we could drive the @ CAPS1. My father said yes. My friend was patient.
Being patient is good because if you are and then you are in a difficult time in life. People of patience can do by bringing something to do. They could what there for three hours and not be in herds. There are people who don't know what to do for three hours. There are people who don't know what to do with ten twinks. These people get done that and they'll just give up. But after all these people who can and can't, people can't stop. People are there for an hour and will explode. And then there are people who can't do it but they do. So all you have to do is find something to do if you can't.
"@ CAPS1 are we still here?" I ask again and again. "@ CAPS2 but almost," he replied. Today we are going to the adventures of @ LOCATION1 and I am so excited! After asking my @ CAPS1 when we would be there, about @ NUM1 minutes later, we finally got to @ LOCATION1's adventures ! The queue to get tickets was long but not too long. Once we got them back, we went to get a padlock to put all our stuff ! The queue wasn't long, so we made it quick ! We were all hungry now, so we went to eat! By the time we got into the restaurant the queues to order were really long! Ok so now that we are all done eating it was time for some awesome rides ! "@ CAPS3, man!" this is what i would say when the queues for the rides were super long! But so far I have been a very patient girl! But, okay, I had to go change to go to the water park and change or go to the bathroom, those lines were also very long! Now that the day is almost over and the park is going to close, my family and I are not in the gift shop - we were there for about @ NUM1 minutes waking up. When we were done and were ready to go, the line wasn't long at all! Finally, there was a line that was not long! All day long, I was a very patient girl! Between everything that has happened throughout this day!
One time I was patient was when my friend and I were at @ ORGANIZATION1 vaction. I was having fun. My family didn't come because they don't like roller coasters. We decided to ride the @ CAPS1, it looked like a really long wait. After an hour and a half of waiting, it started to rain. It was just watering at first but it was enough so they had to close some rides including @ CAPS1. We really wanted to ride so we waited for the rain to stop. After another hour, people left, so we were at the front of the line. My friend and I got front row seats and had a lot of fun. It was worth the wait @ NUM1 1/2 hours @ ORGANIZATION1 and we even went there twice.
One time I was patient was when I was in class @ NUM1 and had to wait to play soccer until this year. I was patient because I waited a long time without doing anything.
Do you know what patience is? Have you ever been patient? Well being patient is something that you need in life. I'll tell you a little bit about patience. (@ NUM1) patience is a big thing. Patience is something we need when we go shopping or when you are in the car. You have to be patient when you are in the car because if you don't you could have an accident. Patience has many qualities. If you are not patient when you are at home you are going to get boring. When there are long lines or something like that and people who are not patient are going to be very frustrated and annoyed with you. (@ NUM2) being patient is important. If you have impatient kids then you are going to teach your kids to be impatient. It is not a good thing. As you can see, I have told you all I could about patience.
At a time when @ CAPS3's parents were the patients, I didn't want dinner @ CAPS7 @ CAPS3. One evening, dad @ CAPS3 made chop soey for dinner. I didn't like chopping soybeans at @ CAPS1 ! The smell of this one @ CAPS2 made me throw up ! But, @ CAPS3 daddy loves chopping soybeans, so he does @ CAPS1 on time! We @ CAPS1 sat on @ CAPS7. I ate a potato and @ CAPS3's dad gave me a whole scoop of ground soybeans. "I'm not going @ CAPS7 that." I said. "I hate chopping soybeans." @ CAPS3 daddy sat patiently at the table, waiting for me at @ CAPS7 what was on the plate @ CAPS3. “ Well, ” I said, “ I '@ CAPS4 @ CAPS7 the meat out of it. " I took the fork and I moved chop soy looking meat. After eating @ CAPS1 the meat. I said "@ CAPS5, I'm done." @ CAPS3 dad laughed at @ CAPS3's stubbornness. "@ CAPS7 the vegetables come out." @ CAPS3 dad said. "@ @ CAPS9 CAPS10 ! I hate celery! I whined. After half war of wills hour @ CAPS3 dad won. I @ CAPS2 wanted to leave the table, but he was very patient with me. I ended up eating the soy chop and left the table.This was when @ CAPS3's dad was very patient.
??? One time when I was very patient was when I was with my grandparents. We were supposed to go to the adventures of @ CAPS1 and my grandmother said she wanted my cousins and I are ready at a certain time so we did not arrived so late. So the next day we arrive at her place at @ NUM1 as she said and we found out that she had slept too much and we all looked at each other because we knew it was going to take a long time. So I said it was okay, we can wait and we all went to his house and waited for everyone to be ready. As we were going out I noticed my grandparents taking care of the suitcases and I said why are you carrying my grandmother's suitcases and we were going to stay overnight in a hotel I so we would still be closer to the adventures of @ CAPS1. So she drove us all home to pick up our ??? ??? and @ NUM2 extra pairs of clothes after that we were on our way to the hotel and ready to go on the @ CAPS1 adventure the next morning. Even though we were meant to go
I once had to be patient when I went to @ LOCATION1 with my mom, dad, @ CAPS1, sister and grandma. My cousins live @ LOCATION1 so we went to visit them. We had to drive @ NUM1 hours in a small pass with five people. We had to be patient during the drive as we were all so excited. When I found out we were going I was really happy and I knew I had to be very patient. We had to drive all day and then find a motel. Then we had to drive up to about @ TIME1 and we were fanaly @ TIME1 my great aunt Lake House, my sister my grandma. It was so much fun to see them again! But then there were more patients on the way home. We were all sad to leave but we had a great time. The return trip seemed shorter than the trip there but still long. When we got home we were all tired and tired of being in the car, but we were happy that we didn't have to drive an extra hour home like my grandmother. It was a time when I had to be patient.
This is the story of a time when I was patient. It was night and all of a sudden, the line for my braces jumped out of place. It was coming out of my mouth and there was nothing I could do about it. I had to wait for my mother to come home and to me but I was scared but I was patient. I waited for my mom to arrive and we had already unplugged the wires. There my things my mother I was patient, use the

I waited all day until @ NUM1, hours and when he finally agreed I got @ NUM2, dollars and it was worth it ?? case if I would have liked him he probably would have lowered the price and that would have been my mistake so far ?? last stone wish my mother ?? me from the practice of football and the ?? we are waiting for an awil and i was lost i was the last are ?? these my envelopes who ?? and i was under a tree when it was raining and it was raining so i didn't put on my helmet like it would ?? me cage held etrest lighting is eanelusoin being ?? is infected did your father show how that ?? feel or act in addition, she wouldn't want a me rushing until it misses and they wish that if it is my desire this is my chance to turn around, then if you are of this type by situation, do not rush for the future ??
What exactly is patience? Patience means calmly waiting for something. One of the times I had to be patient was when I wanted my ears pierced. I tried everything for four years, begging, begging, even cleaning, but it still didn't work. My mom says I have to be @ NUM1 before I can get my ears pierced. So instead of bothering her, I sat down and stayed patient. In doing this, I asked my mother to change the age to twelve. So all I have to do is wait until the soccer is over and find a spot and she'll take me. Patience really helps in a number of ways and I encourage you to try to be patient when you want something because it will all fall into place.
Sometimes being patient is difficult @ CAPS5 I had to do this several times. One time in particular, my life has been overwhelming. It was my favorite day of the year, my birthday. I have always waited long and hard for this day every year until it comes. I got up very early to see @ CAPS3 my gifts @ CAPS5 there were none. My mom was just watching @ CAPS1.V. like nothing matters and I told him "@ CAPS2". @ CAPS3, she replied: "@ CAPS2, why are you up so early ?" I just fell asleep again. When I woke up again nothing happened. So I just waited patiently in my room until something happened, @ CAPS5 nothing. Eventually I went down and played video games all the way to @ NUM1, waiting for someone to say "happy birthday" @ CAPS5, but nothing. So I acted like it was a normal day until @ NUM2: pm when I went to the basement. There was a surprise birthday party for me with gifts and friends and everything. I was glad I was patient, I had a good party and now I am patient every day.
The last @ DATE1 I went with friends to @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS1 @ ORGANIZATION1. @ ORGANIZATION1 is all about Christian rock music. The part that stands out the most is seeing my favorite Christian rock band, @ CAPS2. They played new songs and had a lot of guitar solos. I bought one of their CDs and it was amazing. The past that made me patient was the queue my friend @ PERSON1 and I had to wait to get autographs. He almost stretched out the parking lot door. The bad part was we were pretty much at the end. Even though the wait was long the girl behind us was super nice so we ended up making a new friend. When we finally got to the front it was well worth the wait. Everyone in the band was super cool and I gave singer @ CAPS3 my lucky bracelet. It was then that I was patient.
Once there were two twin chipmunks, the names were @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON1 always had AJ not so much patience. One day it was fine with a cool breeze. AJ decided he wanted to go on a trip with @ PERSON1. So they packed up their camping gear and headed further into the woods at dusk when they reached where they wanted to be. So they tried to make a fire, @ LOCATION1 started collecting firewood and tried to light the fire like mum and dad had taught them there. Like I said in part one @ LOCATION1 has no patience so he kept trying but after a while he stopped he hit the rocks together once and it didn't not start, so @ PERSON1 tried in @ NUM1 minute it started. AJ didn't care, he picked up the acorns and started cooking. But every time he only left them on for @ NUM2 seconds he would try and finally try, he would stop it fine @ PERSON1 @ NUM2 minutes, @ LOCATION1 was really mad now, so they went to bed. When @ PERSON1 woke up in the morning, he found @ LOCATION1 making breakfast. AJ finally learned to be patient.
My head was in the sky. It was mine. The ticket I was craving for was actually mine. I was going to see for three days @ ORGANIZATION1 and break @ CAPS1 with my own eyes ! Only one thing was wrong. The concert was @ NUM1 days away. So soon but oh so far. For three days (no fun expected!) I cried and cried, but only in my head. I didn't want to bother my dad after all, he just spent a lot of money on me! After these three days, I was fine. I still promised myself not to break my rule of not complaining. I couldn't tell if the week had passed quickly or slowly. All I knew was I couldn't wait any longer. Soon it was @ DATE1, and my two favorite bands and a band I loved almost as much called flipleaf, would be at @ LOCATION1 tonight. The day has crept in. I wanted to explode with excitement. All I could think of was what would happen later in the day. Every second my heart was pounding until I got in my dad's car at @ NUM2. cool clothes, crack, tickets? To verify. @ NUM1 days without complaint ? CHECK! We listened to the three groups that we would see up to @ LOCATION1. I thought my heart was back to normal, but with every beat of life they hear louder and louder and almost in time to the beat of their bass drum. Passed a limo with an open window, I swear I saw the singer breaking @ CAPS1. (@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4) feiceps. Saw the limo just as we walked into @ LOCATION1. No more than ten minutes later, we entered the parking lot for @ PERSON1. I got a glimpse of the long line of people waiting to enter. I grabbed my bottle of patience and pulled out the little pieces of what I had left. The huge tunnels lines were gray and dras. We had to walk a mile to get to the end of the line, and the holy line of, if ???? snails, but before I knew it I was in. I had no complaints yet. I was proud of my patience.
One day, I was really patient. I was babysitting and everything was going well until the kid started to fight ! They were my two little brothers of course. They kicked and the youngest bit; so I told them to stop. They did it for a while, then started over on a toy. So I went back to their room and told them to stop again. So they stopped for good until my little brother @ PERSON1 started copying everything everyone else said so I said stop or you'll go to your room. So he stopped and everyone was good for the rest of the night until mum and dad got home now that's a whole different story. This is how I have been patient with my little brothers and sisters.
A time when I was very patient was last year. My aunt said she was taking me to a basketball game. So the next day when I woke up, I woke up too early. My aunt never told me what time she was coming. So I prepared for @ NUM1 am. So at @ NUM2 I called her but she didn't answer. So I was watching TV and playing my game. Then around @ NUM3 pm my aunt called back saying she had to go to the store. so now my fusteration has started to pile up. I wanted to call her back and ask her questions like where are you going and how long you're gonna be gone. but I was trying to be patient. Now at @ NUM4 my mom said let's go ! Now I was really angry because I didn't expect to leave with my mom. So my mom and I got home around @ NUM5 pm. Now I was really angry because she hadn't even called since we left. So I called her and she said she was walking down the street. I was so happy that later that day, I had fun with my cousins and my aunt.
" @ CAPS1, when @ CAPS5 are we opening gifts ? " I asked. “@ CAPS2 we have just returned from church,” she replied. This was our typical @ DATE1 program, cook the night before @ CAPS3 all day, go to the service the day before @ CAPS3, invite the grandparents to dinner that all the kids open a present than to go to the bed for about an hour get up, and open more gifts. Amen ", our pastor concluded the service" @ CAPS5 we are going now, @ CAPS1? " I cried" @ CAPS6 ", she said. @ CAPS8 we had dinner, I felt like we were 'having ants in my pants, I was so excited. time seemed to pass so slowly that I was @ NUM1 before my grandparents left. Finally we were all gathered around the tree @ CAPS3 @ CAPS8 I was about to open my present. All it was was a sleeping bag my dad said, "you @ CAPS5 are all sleeping on the floor in the room @ LOCATION1, but make sure you go you lie down. " @ CAPS8 I was lying on the floor, while my sister was sleeping soundly, I thought, I wonder what I'll get for @ CAPS3. I ended up falling asleep. The next morning at @ NUM2. I jumped out of bed, woke my sister and ran to my parents' room to wake them up. I thought we were finally going to be able to open the presents. It was a time when I had to be very patient. Ma is everything has been paid at the end.
Patience is waiting and getting what you want for the staff if I don't want anything Patience is you owe what before you get it. So patience, that means you owe what in a good way
Once I did a test, it was really long. I had finished early. Me and my friend have waited a long time. They gave us two and a half hours for the test. I ended up with an hour and a half to look forward to. My friend finished within five minutes of me. I read a book but I finished it. I had to wait another hour to really do something. Remember to bring something to do while you are patient. If you have nothing to do, just wait. Patience is a good quality. Patience can be used while waiting for something or someone.
One day I asked my parents if I could buy what game I wanted and what game I wanted and they asked me how much does it cost? I said I didn't know how much it is. So he said we were going to the store and see how much it is. When we got there we found out it was @ MONEY2 and I said I can buy it and he said after a while I maybe started to buy it. begging he always said @ CAPS1 ! when i got home i fell asleep the next morning. I was at home watching @ CAPS2.V and saw this in the trade about the game and it said the game was always @ MONEY1 so I ???. When we went to the mall I saw it was @ MONEY3 and I was finally able to buy it.
Everyone is patient once in their life. I remember I was every patient once when I was ten. It was because of the popcorn. A little bit of cernal popcorn crossed my mind. It was an annoying day, but I was very patient. One day, about two years ago, when I was ten, I swallowed a cernal of popcorn after going to the movies. I remember eating one last piece of popcorn from the popcorn box and then throwing the box away. Well, as soon as I got out and ate my piece of popcorn it started to bother me. My mom and I woke up in the nearby Target to get supplies and run errands. I started to get really thirsty from the cernal popcorn. I asked my mom if she would be willing to buy me a drink because of thirst, but she said she only had a credit card. It meant she could buy her things but she couldn't buy soft drinks. Understood. So I just tried not to think about it. It was very hard. Soon we stopped at our next term, the bank. My mom needed the money to pay for my tennis instructor. I asked her if she could hurry because the cernal popcorn and lack of thirst were hurting me. She said she was going as fast as she could and that we were only a few minutes from the house. I knew it was more like fifteen minutes, not just a few, but I didn't argue. Heart and thirst began to overwhelm me. I felt like it was three hours, but it was only fifteen minutes when we finally got home. I opened the door and ran inside to get some water. I ran and opened the fridge, opened a bottle of water and hugged everything. Then I went out to help my mom bring the supplies and things, and then I drank more water with a smile. In conclusion, we have all learned to be patient at times. I was patient to come home and drink the water. I am always patient and when it pays off I am always happy.
There have only been a few times in my life that I have really had to be patient, but what I remember most is when I was at the airport @ LOCATION1. My parents and I were waiting at our terminal for our flight to @ LOCATION2. @ CAPS2 was waiting about @ NUM1 minutes when @ CAPS2 heard an announcement. "@ CAPS1 has gone wrong with the plane, but @ CAPS5 should be fixed in about an hour." @ CAPS2 eventually discovered that the back door had been slammed too hard, which broke one of the parts. They needed a new part for the emergency slide to work. An hour of waiting seems good to me. But @ CAPS6, there was another ad " I'm sorry, but @ CAPS2 can't get the part right now." The wait will be at least @ NUM2 hours. @ CAPS3 sounded worse, but I stayed calm. My mother was panicking well. Three hours had passed. @ CAPS6 four. @ CAPS6 @ CAPS4. My laptop and iPod ran out of power, so I was just playing with my fingers. @ CAPS6 @ CAPS2 heard "@ CAPS5 turns out @ CAPS2 can't get the part until tomorrow morning." @ CAPS6 a big "ughhh" swept through the terminal. Fortunately, @ CAPS2 received a free night in a hotel until the flight. The wait was exhausting, but @ CAPS2 all had patience, so @ CAPS2 succeeded @ CAPS5.
A few days ago, when I was at cheer, a lot of drama was going on in our team, it was two weeks before the competition and everyone was yelling at someone. There was so much shouting and retorting to our coaches that no one could figure out what we were supposed to be doing. The side where I was for the pom cutin in our second lineup was not in the dividing line that we were supposed to be and was not getting to the kick line in time because the people on the other side us. were pushing so we had to walk much further than they did. @ LOCATION1 (one of our coach daughters) was yelling on the side I'm on for not getting to the toe line on time even though she pushes us dad down so we can't get there then she started to yelling at @ PERSON1 saying it was all wrong so @ PERSON2 said to @ LOCATION1, "@ LOCATION1 stop blaming everyone for anything you are not perfect in all things ether, and c 'you are pushing us so that we can't get to the foot line in time. " @ LOCATION1 didn't know what to say but she said "@ CAPS1 up @ PERSON2 ! That's not true. Even though you could tell she knew it was true because next time we did the kickline , she didn't come close to the center, she moved further and @ PERSON3 arrived in her seat not quite on time but only a few seconds after she was supposed to. I thought @ PERSON2 was loyal to @ PERSON1 even though @ PERSON1 might not have been one of his best friends, they are still friends, but not best friends.
One time when I was patient was when I wanted to go out and my sister wanted to go but she wasn't ready. She must have had her hair done and dressed. I waited patiently and said nothing. I didn't want to but I did. I wanted to go out and my sister wanted to go so I served her. I quietly walked out the door and then my sister shouted that I want to go and wait. I walked into the house and waited for her to find some clothes first, so she went upstairs and found some. She dressed and then had to look for her shoes. She searched the whole house and then found them in a corner. So we were about to go out and I said, girl, what's wrong with your surprised har. She touched her head and said o I forgot. So we went into the house and I tried to put hair in a ponytail for her and it was wrong. So I let her do something and she couldn't. So I parted her hair and put it in two ponytails. Then we went out. It was a time when I hardly waited for my sister.
When I was about to leave my uncle's ranch. I was patiently waiting for my dad to come back so he could help my brother put the @ NUM1 on the tryler. It's been @ NUM2 hours and my dad hasn't come back yet. I was having trouble removing my @ NUM3 from the tryler because it was too heavy and my dad was still riding his @ NUM3. When my dad came home my brother went to assemble his @ NUM3. I was having a lot of trouble trying to get it all and go, but eventually my mom and sister wanted to go, so they finally helped me.
It was @ DATE1 to @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION2. My cousin @ LOCATION3 and I were walking up the street to the carnival they were organizing. When we got there it was running and one of the rides was open. So we sat down until they were all open. We went on all of them, but didn't want to continue. It was called the freax out. There were flashing lights and loud music. We were in the queue but I got out. @ CAPS4 said "why did you stand in line?" "I am scared." "I want to continue anyway." "@ CAPS1 are you waiting later?" I said. We waited an hour. I sat on the bench and @ CAPS4 said "@ CAPS1 are we going for a ride?" "@ CAPS2 we @ CAPS1" my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it. That's when @ CAPS4 said " I'm waiting @ CAPS1 ". "@ CAPS3 let's get it over with." @ CAPS4 was nice to wait until I was ready to continue. In conclusion, my cousin is the kindest person to wait around. On the positive side, I love this ride now.
Have you been patient before? Well, I was sitting there in a nice warm comfortable seat, exhausted, dozing off waiting for them to say @ PERSON1 was coming. It kept crossing my mind @ PERSON1, @ PERSON1, @ PERSON1, but nothing ever happened so I just sat there patiently waiting. My mother was sitting next to me reading an avon magazine she had picked up from the small round wooden table centered in the middle of the orthodontist's silent office. I kept wondering things like wondering what they are going to do today, wondering if I am going to take my extender out or what about my best suspenders. Then I started to stare at the office women typing on their computers. The sound of metal tools echoed in my ear, coming from the back room. A girl walked out "@ CAPS1" I was excited and nervous at the same time but I was proud because I had been sitting there the whole time patiently.
“ Patience ” @ CAPS1 was on his way to the big city to watch a very special baseball game. Can you guess what I'm playing? These are the “tigers @ LOCATION1”, @ CAPS2 the stage @ CAPS3, “@ CAPS1 were so excited this was the first time @ CAPS1 has been at @ LOCATION1. "@ CAPS5 much longer until @ CAPS1 gets there ?" I asked. " About @ NUM1 hour, why ? my mom replayed "because it's so boring to sit here for four hours in the strait." "I know, but you have to be patient." "@ CAPS6." I thought about my pain. " I hurt @ CAPS5 that I could be patient for ?" I just thought about it for a moment. Then a mini, then boom! I was cold: for two hours I slept. Then I woke up just as @ CAPS1 hit the traffic. I asked "Is @ CAPS1 still there", "I hope" my dad said. So I just sat there waiting quietly. About @ NUM2 min later I asked if @ CAPS1 could turn on the radio. "@ CAPS7" my mother said. @ CAPS1 sat there for about @ NUM3 in. Then @ CAPS1 finally started to shake his hand so as not to be anoing, which I was going to do when I got to the game. I thought maybe I would be a little spent, but by the time I thought about something else, I said to myself " I was there !" " " @ CAPS7 ! " I spat. So @ CAPS1 got out of and traveled about @ NUM4 a mile to the ticket booth. As @ CAPS1 was walking I thought to myself " Guess all it takes is patience."
Two weeks of sago means my family went to siyflags, for the feast of fear. The lines were going to be long and I would never be patient, I hate to be patient. We went to @ LOCATION1 city @ CAPS1 first, the lines were only ten minutes long. Then the super man, this one was a little longer. My sister and I were allowed to leave and go to the ripener. Then the perisa wood roller coaster that takes a lot of trail, we waited @ NUM1 minutes between each stop. We finally got to where we exposed the costers with those flash passes that kept coming around. The flash pass takes you to the front of the line. When we finally got to the front line, my patients were @ CAPS2. The roller coaster has derailed. It was a coster @ NUM2 mile but a tur. It was then that I was patient.
One day last year I had to be very patient, my mother told the family that we would be going to six flags soon. I was filled with excitement and couldn't wait so I asked her when and she said she didn't know yet. This pissed me off because the last time she said about going somewhere we ended up not going. The only thing I knew for sure was that it had to be a @ DATE1 because she works during the week. So I waited until @ DATE2 and then asked my mom if we could go to this @ DATE1. She said no because we had to schedule it more and we couldn't randomly go a @ DATE1. This @ DATE1 I bugged her every day until she finally started planning it. The first thing she did was check her work schedule to make sure. She didn't have any meetings or plans for the next @ DATE1. My stomach sagged when she told me she had things to do, so she continued to look at her schedule. The next free @ DATE1 she got was in two weeks. I was okay with that because it's better than nothing. Over the next two weeks, I saved money for six flags. By the end of the two weeks I had about @ MONEY1 saved and was practically bouncing off the walls because I was so excited. I think he was the most patient I have ever been.
Patience waits without complaining to do something you want to do. When I was at an outside courier with my mom, two older sisters, a younger brother, a niece, and a dog, I patiently waited to go to the @ ORGANIZATION1 store to try out the iPad. When I did, I realized the iPad is awesome! After the room, we went to get some ice cream. My little brother had a root beer flavored slush, my niece, my dog, and I had vanilla ice cream. After I finished my ice cream, I put the container on the floor and let my dog lick the rest from the bottom. We had spent @ NUM1 hours there ! What a surprise! Then we went home!
Once @ PERSON1 was patient it was when @ CAPS1 and I taught him how to pitch. @ PERSON1 easily developed a nice liquidation and delivery, but the arin angle was off. But that didn't stop him. @ CAPS1 asked him if he wanted to stop but @ PERSON1 said "no!" @ CAPS2 time went by @ PERSON1 started to get better and better. He now enjoys throwing a NUM1 mph fasiball at a seeker. The day it is inaccurate, he does not give, he keeps trying and does not drink wine. @ PERSON1 is now the number two starter in the rotation. Thanks to a few seltons patience.
"@ CAPS1 or @ CAPS3! It will be here soon, don't worry, ”@ CAPS2 said. A patient person experiences difficulty without complaining. Well, in those few days (which seems like a downside) I haven't been that so called "@ CAPS3" person. Halloween was coming in a few days and my costume still hasn't arrived in the mail. I waited and waited but @ CAPS5 @ CAPS1 too long ! For the fifth time, I watch the small red hand of the clock turn. They said it would come @ DATE1 but it isn't. " I've been sitting here for ten hours where the @ CAPS4 track is !" " I shout. Then I take a look at the clock @ NUM1. What! It has been one hour ! How can we bear to wait so long! "@ CAPS5 coming soon" I tell myself. A few hours later, I see a small white truck @ CAPS6- @ CAPS7 walking down the street. (@ CAPS8 that's it!) @ CAPS9 to watch. No, it continues to pass. I sigh then drag myself down the steps. @ CAPS10 ! " I sobbed in agony," Why me this feeling he consumes like that? " I walked over to the kitchen and a brown box on the counter. I'm dizzy when I make giant steps towards him. ”@ CAPS5 here ! @ CAPS5 here ! " I cry in up and down. Finally!
One of the many times I've been patient is when my @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2, and I went to a restaurant. We ordered our food and found a tabil. We were sitting there waiting for the food. I ask my @ CAPS1 "@ CAPS3 is it going to take a lot longer ?" @ CAPS4 said "you must be a Pactian and wait". And then a little after the end of our meal. It was totally worth it.
About three or four times I have been patient; it was when I was five and it was my birthday and my grandmother shopping for me had to be patient and wait for her to come back with my presents. The other time was when I was @ NUM1 and it was @ CAPS1 day and I got up really early and ready to be patient, again and wait for my dad to wake up for me to can open my gifts. Then the other time was when my friend had to do something, so I had to be skating again, so I waited for him to come back. This will conclude my weathered paper being.
The time I was patient was when @ CAPS4 went to @ LOCATION1 "mom!" I exclaimed. "@ CAPS1's go, I want to go, I'm excited and ready to go." @ CAPS2 mom and I were at home packing everyone's things. It was a beautiful @ DATE1 at @ LOCATION2 and it was also @ CAPS2 stepfather's birthday. "@ CAPS3 you have to be patient okay, @ CAPS4 has a long drive, have you got everything you need." @ CAPS5 brought me there. I had to get some coloring material, the portable reader @ CAPS6, ect…. I had @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 what else @ CAPS4 needed until @ CAPS2's stomach growled, it looked like a bear protecting its cubs, fierce and hungry. Then I remembered, ding, I thought in @ CAPS2's head, food is what I need to get. So I rushed into the kitchen like a race car trying to win a race. I packed turkey sandwiches, pb & j sandwiches, fries. Saltandvinager, sweet and sour and onion (carosse) and jolepenyo cedar (yum). Now I have everything I thought, "from @ CAPS4 go". @ CAPS9 @ CAPS2 mom and once again I rushed to the door "I have the address", asked @ CAPS2 father. "@ CAPS10 @ CAPS3 Got it." @ CAPS11 when @ CAPS4 started to leave @ CAPS2 sister fell asleep. @ CAPS5 slept like a rock the whole way, although I don't think the shore was rock. after @ NUM1 hours of being awake in the car I thought maybe I should try to sleep but the excitement was so fast I could feel it then I fell asleep. I thought I would be able to stay awake the entire trip, but I was marked impossible. Finally @ CAPS2 step dad shouted "wake up !!" I was so excited when I woke up, "is @ CAPS4 still there, the first thing that came out of @ CAPS2's mouth" yes "and of course the first thing I did has been jumping up and out of care ! "@ CAPS12!" @ CAPS2's mother shouted. I paused like I was a character in a video game and the player presses pause. " @ CAPS13 , take a few out of the bags. "" @ CAPS14 "I said with a scowl on @ CAPS2's face. what I did was sleep.
Being patient isn't always that easy, in fact last year was a year when I had to sit in a car with @ NUM1 rude kids, screaming and crying for @ NUM2 hours. Last year I was so excited to see my big @ CAPS3 davn in ???. with my grandfather. My pa @ CAPS1 bag is a fan to talk, @ CAPS2 later that I discovered that my cousins @ NUM1 younger came. It was going to be a long drive. We packed our things in the car. I brought my ipod and a book, @ CAPS2 my cousins brought ??? loud, fluffy toys that they bot just for the ride. As we started heading to @ LOCATION1, I turned on my ipod and found that it only had @ PERCENT1 battery left. Halfway there, I was almost Borden's dad, @ CAPS2, the kids had just moved in. When I was sure they were asleep, I decided to join them. WACK ! I auske is a sob slap in the face, "were there" my cousin sang, finally I thought to myself as I woke up again with pain and stiffness in my neck. After visiting my @ CAPS3, it was about @ NUM4 hours and cousins were all asleep again and I knew it would be a good back home.
There was a day when I was patient and I was so nice and this girl was so much in her head that she put herself in my opinion because she was pushing me and hitting me. So I just left her in front of me and we were in @ CAPS1 and a lot of people are ready for @ CAPS1 lady said to stop pushing her. Then we were in class and so I put my hand up and she said be patient I said I'm patient so shut up so please shut up so she don't shut up so I had another time and the teacher calls me to get mad at me.
I will write about the time I was patient. One day after my family and I returned from church, I asked my room if she could cook breakfast, but she did not answer me as she was on the phone with my grandmother and my grandmother spoke a lot. It was so organizing. For example, I kept pacing but just sat down. After an hour of patience, my mom and grandmother said goodbye and hung up the phone and I finally had breakfast.
One day it was @ NUM1. My mom woke me up, my brother and my dad to get us ready. I fell asleep again in the car as we were up high. I woke up from a fat @ CAPS1 during breaks and when I looked up we were in a long line of cars, "where are we?" I ask for "six flags". @ CAPS2 my brother. I could hear impatient people all around me. They were thinking about screaming and yelling as people tried to make their way through the park. It looks like we were going faster than @ CAPS3 fast people, and we were one of the first people to get in first. It was the impatient @ CAPS3 group of people I had ever seen.
Pg @ NUM1 : @ CAPS1 she is crying ! I just wanted to get out of the car and walk home. We were @ NUM2 in a suburb who were all crushed together ! So we couldn't even hold our arms anymore. I felt like I was locked in jail with chains on me. It was @ NUM3 in the morning and I saw a big sign saying welcome to @ CAPS2. So by that point we only had about an hour left, I was so excited. We have finally reached our destination key envelope. It was the longest trip of my life! But I did my best to stay patient and wait. But in the long run I realized I wasn't and had a whole weekend of waves and a temperature of @ NUM4 ° @ CAPS3 degrees. When I thought about how long it would take to get here, I didn't even want to think about how long it would take to get home! But as I know I have the patients to go home!
Once I was patient, it was yesterday. I had just finished the @ NUM1 part of the rest and was very anxious and wanted to get up and more, but I was taking the @ CAPS1 so I couldn't. Instead, I had fun in every way I could, like pretending to sing along by writing songs in my head over and over, even twiddling my thumbs ! So in the end, she let us talk. I was sitting next to some of my friends so I just talked to them. Somehow we started talking about dangeons and dragons, they kept asking me what class they would be and what they were. Anyway, I kept trying to talk but kept being interrupted so I just relaxed and waited my turn. Finally it was my turn to speak, but we had to go to lunch so I could never say what mine was. It was a time when I was patient.
Have you ever got bored because someone kept saying be patient? I have and @ CAPS1 will tell you about my time being patient. I was on my way to @ LOCATION1 once, the plane ride was not as bad as what @ CAPS1 will tell you. When @ CAPS3 got to @ PERSON1 @ CAPS3 had to cross the border of @ PERSON1 @ NUM1, it was hot !!! I think the temperature has reached @ NUM2 ? @ CAPS3 had to wait in this little room with about @ NUM3 people, and they had no air conditioning. We were all waiting for the bus to arrive, and after @ NUM4 hours a bus arrived. @ CAPS3 got along while about @ NUM5 people came to barge in front, @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 is missing this bus. Then @ CAPS3 waited again for a bus after @ NUM6 hours, a bus arrived while @ CAPS2 was trying to climb, then @ CAPS3 was pushed back. @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 missed that bus I was @ CAPS2 blasted @ CAPS2 made my family. Another thing that frustrated me was that there were thousands of flies everywhere. @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 waited after @ NUM4 more hours for a bus to arrive but my little brother was in the bathroom @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 missed that bus @ CAPS2 my mom was telling me to calm down and be patient @ CAPS2 I remained patient until @ NUM8 The bus arrived, @ CAPS3 got on but the bus did not go where @ CAPS3 was supposed to @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 had to go back to the same place where @ CAPS3 was, but still my mom once said to be patient. One of the agents on site saw how long @ CAPS3 was waiting @ CAPS2 once the next bus arrived after @ NUM9 hours and @ NUM10 minutes, he held everyone up for my family and I to get on, and a called the driver "take them on their own", @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 had the bus to ourselves, and you know what it was worth.
There was a time when I had to wait to deal with my own problem. My sisters and I entered the house and one of them went to take care of it personally while I was patient not to you and knock on the door loudly. Tell him (@ ORGANIZATION1 or @ CAPS1) to @ CAPS3 in everything they do. By the way, @ ORGANIZATION1 is @ NUM1 years old and @ CAPS1 is @ NUM2 years old. I had waited and waited be very patient not to lengthen "@ CAPS3", @ CAPS4 on I really have to take care of my personal problem "??? something like that It was good to be very patient to be a non-patient people because think about when, if you really have to handle something in the bathroom or toilet, people will think you're in a rush ??? instead of patience. Either way, they 'll talk about it to anyone he knows at a bad time when they are just talking about anything. Finally, this is not a time when I expect patience with others.
Patience @ MONTH1 sounds easy, but, however, it can be difficult. Stand in line, wait @ CAPS1 etc. everything requires patience. Everyone, young or old, has patience, just like I did when I was in class @ NUM1. Every day I wonder if this is a dream or a nightmare. Every day when I was in class @ NUM1 I always wanted something that would change my life for all eternity. After @ NUM3 years, this wish would finally come true. I was very patient while waiting for our letter to be accepted or refused. Before I knew it, my mom, dad and I were on a plane to China. There we would see the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and @ LOCATION1 not to mention our main goal of adopting a little sister. I had no idea what I was going to do. I waited for @ NUM4 weeks then we went to the lobby and she was with her caregiver and all the other families who were also expecting their babies. I couldn't believe we were the @ NUM5 to receive our gift from China. BIG @ CAPS2 ! The moment my mom tried to pick it up, she started warning, pinching, kicking and who knows what else. After about an hour, she calmed down and calmly played with her toys and the like. That night we went out for dinner at @ ORGANIZATION1. My dad ordered a milkshake and he left it ??? a part that was also an @ CAPS2. He only got it back when the glass was empty. We quickly learned that she would be a roller coaster with its ups and downs. She loved cakes and ice cream and only wanted daddy. It was daddy's dream come true. In conclusion, you will be using your patience every day, regardless of its size. Patience will work its way into your life no matter how difficult it is. Everyone has patience, the question is " will you use it ?" "
One person i know who is paitent is my dad he is very paitent like once we were in the drive to mc donalds and as soon as we pulled up the lady was like just a second and she but ??? sat there for @ NUM1 minutes and saw like pull out the ??? and go to the restaurant and order my food but my dad just sat there adjusting the gas until the lady came back and i was so mad the lady made us sit there for @ NUM2 minutes but then I was happy because I got my food. Then when we pushed my dad away, I said, that's why the patients got ??? and my double chess barger and my big iced tea with chocolate chip cookies and my dad taught me one ??? Classes??? ??? ??? ??? nothing but drama and not happiness.
The moment I had to be patient was when I had to stand in line to pull the @ CAPS1 at point @ CAPS2. The first dot @ CAPS2 was fun, but queuing took patients we had to queue for about half an hour. Some people continued to leave because the wait was too long. I had to remain patient if I wanted to take the tour. Second, I was excited to get on the rollar coster, so I stayed in the line. Staying patient was a bit difficult when people were pushing and cutting, but it was worth it when I started riding. As you can see, sometimes it is good to be patient, but when you are doing something fun, it is worth it. When people push, you just have to be calm and patient.
I'm still patient, I'm really patient until my birthday, then when I get gifts I don't need to be patient anymore because I wait a year for gifts, then I wait @ CAPS1 because that it's only a month away from home. anniversary And this year, I'm patient until @ CAPS1 because I already know what I'm getting. But that's why I'm patient for pretty much nothing else I'm patient for.
Patience means being understanding and tolerant. I find patience hard to find with a lot of other people. Some people are blessed with the gift of patience. These people find it easy to wait even when it's the night that the fanaly of your favorite book series comes out. "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2" the clock taunted me by moving slower than ever. Why @ CAPS10 wasn't back yet, I didn't know. Everything I knew was going to happen that night, it was a very bad thing. It must have been the unbearable heat that hit me because when the door slammed @ CAPS10 said that @ CAPS4 had only been gone for five quick mutes. I didn't believe her, but we got in the car and took the twisty, twisty road. We had perfectly timed our drive to see red lights at every red light. It was as if the light was angry with us. We also got stuck behind every slow person with the @ CAPS3 way around them. Just when I had a dawning cry inside me, we saw a green light and made our way to @ LOCATION1. The @ CAPS8 bookstore came to the right and @ CAPS8's nervousness got more out of hand. I bounced up and down like I was on a trampoline and stopped the split second I saw the line in front of us. "@ CAPS3 !" I shouted, "I have no patience left to wait in this one-line monstrosity." It was like the whole town wanted to piss me off as much as possible. I dragged the lounge chairs from our van to stand in line. Flop ”I fell on the black chair and waited. It was going to be a long night. "@ NUM1 twinks until midnight" @ CAPS8 @ CAPS10 explained to me "It's impossible" I told him. "You can do it." @ CAPS4 was right, @ NUM1 minuets was not that long of a wait. I breathed in the smell of coffee coming from inside and listened to the chatter among the people. The @ NUM1 minuets would be over soon, and for the first time that night I was patient. "@ CAPS5, the seat belt snapped on and I opened the last book in the @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 trilogy. What will happen " how is it going to end "The spirit @ CAPS8 was full of questions. "@ CAPS9 was this expectation really bad" asked @ CAPS10. "I guess not," I replied shyly. " Be patient has paid off ," said @ CAPS10. I didn't answer, I was already reading a thousand minuet. I learned that being patient really pays and not complaining makes life so much easier. The patient understands and @ CAPS9 that I am a little better to be patient, things will be much better.
Once I was patient because the teacher had to tell me something. So I waited by the door, but she had to go to the office, so I had to wait. When the teacher returned, she said thank you for being patient. Patients really mean you can wait. Some kids are not patient they get screwed so much eg there was @ NUM1 kids in a group where we were playing a game and they got so fucked up because they weren't called on a lol . But the game was radom you pick the stick and who ever sticks it was gone. So being a patient means you have to be able to wait.
Patience is something or someone who likes to wait for someone or something. patience.
"@ CAPS1 go!", I shouted running towards the entrance of @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. “@ CAPS4 one minute, you have @ CAPS4 for your friend,” my mom said. As I stopped at @ CAPS4 for my mom, best friend @ PERSON1, and brother @ CAPS5 @ PERSON2, I started hitting the rocks to keep myself busy. Once they finally caught up with me, we entered the huge theme park. "@ CAPS1 go up @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8," I said histatically. “@ CAPS9 we can go on, but me and @ PERSON1 are staying in the back,” my mom said. “@ CAPS10 because me and @ PERSON3 are going to row number one!” @ PERSON2 shouted. As we started to walk to the queue we were told it would be a minute @ NUM1 @ CAPS4 for us to go. After we got in line I was like, wow, this is a long queue. It wasn't much longer that we finally got to the roller coaster ride. “@ CAPS11!” The belt buckle sounded as we all got on the roller coaster. “@ CAPS12!” Everyone said when we took off. Afterwards, I told myself that I could be patient.
@ PERSON2 and I went to the slove. @ CAPS1 was picking up marsh mellows and chocolate to make someone. @ CAPS1 was working ??? I was six when @ CAPS1 ran into a lot of people ditching everything for smiles. So @ PERSON2 and I went in line. @ CAPS1 sat there for at least fifty minutes waiting for marsh mellows and chocolate; but @ CAPS1 came out with two mellows and two packs of chocolate. I asked him "@ PERSON2 why do you have two !" @ CAPS1 said when I waited they got rid of it so they gave me two to one. I smiled and we ??? Thank you! When we got back to the car we told @ CAPS2 to the other sister "@ PERSON1" that we were getting two @ NUM1 said ??? " @ CAPS2's sister chuckled, we got back into the car from @ PERSON2 and but the bag in the trunk was another ??? We got home and @ PERSON1 ate three, I ate two and @ PERSON2 ate five @ CAPS1 ??? us. Thank you .
Today I am going to write @ CAPS3 about a friend of mine who is very patient. My friend's name is @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. She is a very patient and pleasant girl. @ CAPS1 is so patient that when I told her to hold on for a second I came back an hour later and she was still there, she is absolutely the most patient and awesome girl I know! In the test (like @ CAPS3.EAP), she always takes her time. And she uses her time wisely (ha ha and her last name is @ CAPS2). At @ ORGANIZATION1 she doesn't wait in a long line for a corn dog. Now I '@ CAPS3 is starting to think @ CAPS1 likes to wait. I like having @ CAPS1 around because she doesn't mind waiting for me when I need to do something.
The patience you understand and the experimenters of tolerance differ from the allies without complaint. I'll tell you about a time when I was patient. "I'm going to tell your mom you broke the hole in the wall" @ CAPS1 you don't tell me that "@ CAPS2 shouted. This is an example of blackmail, one of the many things you have to be with patient in your life. @ CAPS2 is a six year old baby girl I babysat. One day she was at my house, we were playing a game that involved shoving a shower into a wall. When it was my turn, I literally drove the shou into the wall. My mom came home and told the boys she hurt me. But the only thing I had to do was thair was a witness . The six year old who can't keep a secret I told her not to tell my mom because @ CAPS1 is what she did I would be in big trouble and she won't would no longer be able to come. We went to the store and she found out the glory of blackmail, she said she would tell my mom @ CAPS1 that I didn't buy her ice cream. I'm @ NUM1 ? F day . I refused to buy her ice cream so she told my mom my mom didn't care.
Applause filled the building after the end of the first dance. I was backstage with my dance team reviewing the routine for the third time. The backstage was cold and crowded and I was already sweaty after a workout! It was my first dance recital and I thought it would take an hour, I was wrong. I soon found out that we were the last to play and that it lasted at least five hours. "@ CAPS1 a lot more dances?" and "what dance are we on?" @ CAPS2 what everyone had in mind or said. Every hour felt like a day! I had so many excited, bored and nervous emotions. Then finally it was our turn to go on stage. I was so relieved after all this waiting that it was finally our turn! I did twirls and jumps and jumps and had a great time! I had a wonderful time dancing. Great things require patience!
One rainy, boring old afternoon I asked my mom to take me to a place called modern, if you don't know what it is, I'll tell you. Well, modern is a place that I love. It has everything I love, a money spote park and tree stuff. I went with my mother, I told her she didn't have to stay but she insisted that she stay. So she looked good, I skated for @ NUM1 hour, and watched me cheer myself on and even bought me a new board. My mother is the most patient person I have ever met.
Being patient @ CAPS4 is a great trait to have. When you are patient, you are respected. This is @ CAPS4 why I have so much respect for the @ CAPS7 teacher. @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 @ CAPS4 a very patient person. If you didn't understand something, she will work it out with you until you understand. Even it takes a few weeks. Once she was teaching us to add negative numbers and I couldn't understand and she worked with me until I understood. She was very patient. Let me tell you what happened. “@ CAPS1 class today, we're going to add a negative number C.” @ CAPS2 @ CAPS4 is going to be a snap, I thought silently. I had no idea at all that I would have no idea what to do at all and Professor @ CAPS7 was going to have to be very patient with me. When teacher @ CAPS7 finished explaining the rules for adding negative numbers, I was already lost "@ CAPS3 are some examples of problems everyone should try," teacher @ CAPS7 said. A few minutes later, she went to each student and checked their answers. When she came up to me, she had a worried expression on her face. "@ CAPS4 everything is fine, you haven't fixed your sample problems," she asked me. “I don't understand @ CAPS2,” I replied. @ CAPS7 teacher was silent for a moment then she said "come see me after class" @ CAPS5 I waited until the end of the day then I went to see her. “ I noticed you were having trouble with math today, ” teacher @ CAPS7 said. "@ CAPS6 would fix this problem." @ The CAPS7 teacher sat down with me and showed me what to do in stages. After about twenty minutes of her explaining to me how to do it, I finally started to pick it up. @ NUM1 minutes later I did. “ You can go now, ” the @ CAPS7 teacher said. “ You understand him better now than the other students. " " Thank you for being patient with me @ CAPS5 "I said before leaving. @ The CAPS7 teacher has just smiled. It was a time when Professor @ CAPS7 was very patient with me. And I'm glad she is
Whistle, whistle, that was the sound of football referees whistling for substitutes. (I was playing defense.) @ CAPS1 was calling my name to get me out. When I got out of the field, I took my water bottle and sat on the sub until finally I asked my trainer if he could get in. His response was that you had just come down. In my mind, I thought I had been gone for almost ten minutes now, how could I have just gotten out. So I waited a few more minutes to ask again. When he finally let me in. When I got on the pitch I realized I was on the side where the ball barely touched the entire game. I played for about five minutes and then was overwhelmed again. I was on the bench even longer this time. I was losing my patients. I asked my coach if I could go back, he said of course. By the end of the game I understood why my coach put me on the bench so much because he loved the Wolverines from @ LOCATION1 and I had a state tattoo on my face. It was a time when I was patient.
It was a time when I was patient. One time when I was patient was when my mom went to buy me a new pair of shoes. My mom was buying me a new pair of shoes because I haven't had any in months. I was very patient for my mom to buy me a new pair of shoes. I know when my mom has money and I need something new, she gets it. I was patiently waiting for my mom. I trusted my mom would give me the shoes. Then I heard a knock on the door, opened the door, and it was my mom standing there with my new pair of shoes on.
Real @ CAPS3 was one of the fastest runners in @ LOCATION1. No one could surprise him beating him in a race, or even surprise him. It made him very impatient. Even when his friends and family were talking to him, that was what they begged him for. "@ CAPS1… @ CAPS2… @ CAPS3… @ CAPS4… are… you… doing?" @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 was furious that no one was as fast as him. So he ran away. He escaped. He ran as fast as possible. It only took him @ NUM1 minutes and he was already at @ LOCATION2. In @ LOCATION2 he said people weren't walking and were as fast as he could. But that was not the case when his team spoke to them. For sure, where can I find @ CAPS6? ”The @ CAPS7 replied.“ @ CAPS8… ch… .first… eh… .you… .turn… .eh… .meil… ch ” @ CAPS9 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 shouted that he thought no one was as fast as him. So he just had to be patient.
Ah patients, I know a lot of people find it hard to be patient, let me tell you a story about my patience. two hours away I was really excited @ CAPS1 left at exactly six o'clock that morning I was happier that the failure to make this trip @ CAPS1 took the night route. I was ready to go out, I was very excited, my dad said "don't worry mate, @ CAPS1 will be there soon, calm down mate" I stopped resting. There I was just waiting to see what our campsite looked like while patiently waiting @ CAPS1 finally got there that's when I got @ CAPS4 to be patient.
@ PERSON1 is a young boy with a squirrel bladder and his bathroom queue at super @ CAPS1. @ PERSON1 said to himself: '' patience, there is always good to be patient ''. So he waited his turn. @ PERSON1 was in the middle of the line behind five people. @ PERSON1 was the head of six people who were all doing the pee-pee dance. He learns to be polite in school so he lets the six people get ahead of him. Ten minutes later @ PERSON1 walked into the bathroom and found a hundred dollar bill on the floor. @ PERSON1 knew more about finder keepers than politeness, so he took it. @ PERSON1 has learned that being polite and patient is the right thing to do, and sometimes it has its rewards.
I once was patient when I and three other friends of mine were hanging out at school one day. We were bored so we all went on the track and decided to run a mile. Since this is a relay one person will run a mile, then the second person goes after the first person I have done, after that the third person goes after the second person has done their mile, then finally after the third person went i got to go for a mile run because i was the fastest at running a mile. As I had to wait until the very end, I had to have the patience to wait and finally to leave.
Patience, not all of us have it. It is difficult to learn the theme, but even more difficult to master the theme. It's a good time to use your patience.
When I went to @ CAPS1 conly @ ORGANIZATION2 for my church youth group, I took it to my friend. In the maze we were to go as a group of @ CAPS2 and I, my dad, @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS3 went in a group @ ORGANIZATION1, @ CAPS4 in the group behind us. Halfway through @ CAPS5 @ ORGANIZATION2 there was a guy wrapping us around with a chainsaw and then @ PERSON1 slapped my face in the face so we had to stop this @ ORGANIZATION2 from @ ORGANIZATION2 so we could to find and just before I found them my group friends @ CAPS6 came over and had to wait @ NUM1 minutes which seemed like a long time. So they didn't have the chance to be chased by the guy with the chainsaw.
My story on patience is the time I spent in line for @ NUM1 hour and @ NUM2 minutes to ride the "@ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2" which is that really cool ride. The first thing I did in line was try to talk to people because I knew I would be in line for a while. I said "hi" to the couple in front of me then we chatted for a while and it turned out they had come down south of @ PERSON1, @ LOCATION1 which is very close to @ LOCATION2 where I am live and it seemed so strange being at @ LOCATION3 and meeting people who lived across our town time seemed to pass because before I knew it we were strapped to our seats and off we went we goooooo
You @ MONTH1 have already heard: patience is a virtue. If you don't already know it, being patient means being understanding and tolerant. The opposite of that probably has a temper, or having an @ CAPS1 shortly before angering @ CAPS1. I believe that having patience in life is @ CAPS1 important, and I try to have patience every day. I believe life is a marathon, not a sprint, and by that I mean if anything takes time you have a lot of life and sport connections because I'm a good athlete @ CAPS1. I play football, which also requires a lot of patience. When I make a good pass and my catcher lets go, I remember having patience with him, just like my coach did with me. Football is a team game and we all need to be patient with each other. Although sport is a great example, patience goes way beyond that, you have to have patience with yourself before you can have patience with others. And what do I mean by that? Whether you are a child or an adult, you need to forgive yourself when you are wrong. If you are late for work, you should erase it and say to yourself, “ @ CAPS2, don't do it again. " @ CAPS3 that you forget everything except what you just said. And once again I get back to sport. If you lose a game, you watch the movie, you realize what you did wrong and don't make those mistakes again. Then you forget about the defeat and strive to win the next game. I believe that patience is one of the most important virtues that a person can have.
Have you ever been patient or has your patient been told? Patience a Patience is a @ NUM1 year old girl who is always told how patient she is @ CAPS1 is one of many stories about patience being very patient. One day, patience wanted to go to the most amazing amusement park in Juancey, so her mother began to search the Internet. It took her mom two weeks to get everything ready, she had chosen the amusement park, the money to go and the hotel where they were going to stay at @ TIME1. All the while, Patience didn't say anything and just waited without asking her mom if she had it all planned or if she was still taking her to an amusement park. When they arrived at the hotel, Patience Maman had to retrieve the room key to go to their room, unpack and get dressed to leave. All patience said nothing. When they finally got to the amusement park there was a long line to get tickets so they had to wait two hours. During all this, patience did not complain. They finally got their ticket and chose the biggest roller coaster first. But there was a long queue for it, Patience told her mom that she really wanted to take this ride and wanted to stand in line. Her mom said 'ok' and they waited an hour until they could go but the whole wait was worth it. Patience was patient the whole wait and in the end she did all the roller coasters and had fun. It is the story of patience to be patient. I hope you liked it.
Once I was patient was when I was playing volleyball. I'm patient when I play volleyball because when you don't score you can't serve. A game we didn't do very well and I really wanted to serve because my overhand was great. Everyone has to serve except me on this maten. In the end, our team ended up winning. I never once complained that I couldn't serve. Everyone applauded and chanted because they won by two points.
It must hurt ! every purchase to wait. If you've been in contact sport before, you know you're hurting yourself, you have to wait for it to improve, and then you can play again. When you stretched your ankle, it hurts a lot. After the prang I had to go to the witch doctor because you have to wait forever anyway, but sometimes it's worth it. Once you entered the nurse asked you a few questions so you have to wait even longer now @ CAPS1! But at least you end up finding out what's wrong, after the doctors came in they had to do x-rays which took a long time to develop. but I finally got them back and found out it was just a spring. After everything improved, my football coach said that I would only be a substitute in the game because he didn't want my ankle to hurt again. But at the end of @ DATE1 he let me play! Guess that's what I got for waiting for Patatley the entire game.
On a stormy day, my brother and I were playing soccer in our house. My brother threw the ball in the air and scissors it. The bullet hit my mother's lamp and broke the bulb. She asked me and I said it was my brother. My mom said I had to fix the lamp. It was hard and the pieces kept falling. It only took patience to fix it. In the end, none succeeded in fixing it. Patience is always good to be patient.
Once upon a time a princess named @ PERSON1 was a nice princess but one day she was hungry and didn't want to eat so she told him to do it but she was taking a shower so @ PERSON1 had to wait and be patient she sat in her room for what seemed like years to her read a book looked @ CAPS1.V and went to see if it had been done it was not done and @ PERSON1 did was not patient and got really angry and knocked on the door and said you better hang up or or and then she saw someone out of the corner of her eye and she realized that she had left the light on in the bathroom and no one was there she was now right behind her in hell she was embarrassed and humiliated so she ran into her room and cried and that's it history of the time when the princess was not patient!
One time I was patient was when my little sister was in the tub for four hours taking a bath. But I was waiting for her to finish.
Finally, the day was here! The New Roller Coaster @ CAPS4 The Michogg Adventure We Open ! ?? couldn't wait! Only one thing prevents me from making the trip, the trip by car. We crammed our clues into the old van and set @ CAPS4. After @ NUM1 minutes. "Are we there already?" my brother says. Finally we arrived. We waited @ CAPS4 for the checked stand for half an hour, then entered. my brother and sister wanted to continue kiddy ??. there is still an hour. “@ CAPS1 up, your older brother wants to take the big tour,” my mom said. That was it, the best no stink! Only one problem there ?? people ?? for ??? "@ CAPS2, it will be worth it" thought we entered the queue and after @ NUM2 hours we resumed when it was over, @ NUM3 eycloimed. "It was avoré ??? start over! @ CAPS3 then I looked @ CAPS4 the line. Twice as many people were lined up. "@ CAPS4 at least there won't be so many people on the other rides, I said @ NUM3 was very patient to make the trip even though he lost @ NUM5 hours
One fine morning @ CAPS1 went to renew its lisence. But I, if he woke up very early, he would be the only one there. But of course he wouldn't be the only one there. Unfortunately everyone thought the same thing. But @ CAPS1 was really tired he woke up at @ NUM1 a.m. but they open at @ NUM2 a.m. but @ CAPS1 didn't know. So @ CAPS1 went to the panacake house and got him some nice hot coffee, but when he came back there was a line around the cone. But @ CAPS1 waited and waited and @ CAPS1 got its license.
One time I was patient was when my mom would take me to my friends' house to play soccer. It's a long story, but I'm going to tell it to you anyway. It all started when my friend @ PERSON1 called me to come and play football. So I asked my mom for a walk, she said "yes". So when we drove my ???? she had to look for things at the grocery store. She spent a huge hour in there. She had to go, otherwise she took @ NUM1 hours there. Then I called and said "are you coming or what". Then I said yes. I was so kept calm and waited. Then I finally got there. It's not really a story. It was then that I was patient.
Here I was on day three of @ CAPS1 volleyball practice. I was sure I was going to make the A team. I threw the ball and let @ CAPS3 fall. The pitch was not good. I started @ CAPS3 again and hit @ CAPS3 as hard as I could. “ @ CAPS1 last serve ,” I thought, “ please finished. " I looked at the round white ball flying in the air. As @ CAPS3 approached the net I felt like gravity suddenly kicked in. The ball fell on touching the net and came out of @ CAPS3. @ CAPS3 has not completed @ CAPS3. I felt the cool wind brush against @ CAPS1's sweaty face. While the coaches decided which team we would be on, I sat down on the damp grass. Finally, they handed me a small white envelope, I inhaled and exhaled slowly. I could feel @ CAPS1's stomach knot in a giant knot. I have been waiting for this moment for months. I reached for @ CAPS1's sweaty hand in the envelope. I was getting more nervous the second. I slowly slid the piece of paper out of the envelope. I heard a girl scream with ecstasy. Finally, I was able to discover the weather forecast where I was part of the A team, the @ CAPS2 team or that I was cut. @ CAPS3 felt the world depended on @ CAPS3. I felt a rush of relief and excitement when I saw the word “ congratulations ”. @ CAPS3 at the sight of those words, I pulled out the rest of the letter, "you made the @ CAPS2 team." I suddenly had a feeling of mixed emotions running through @ CAPS1's body. I just wanted to be happy. I went to congratulate everyone who made a team and hug those who didn't. After all this time, I finally knew. @ CAPS3 made me happy to know that I tried something and had to wait to find out if I was successful or not. I wouldn't have had @ CAPS3 otherwise.
@ CAPS7 was my dad hasn't come yet, is he ??? . "@ PERSON1, sweetheart," @ CAPS2 @ CAPS7 begins, "Your father has been called to war." "@ CAPS1" I ran into the @ CAPS2 room passing by and saying he could have said goodbye, haven't seen him for two weeks now that he's gone. "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS7 is entered "@ PERSON1 I know this is difficult for you, but you can send him letters. "I know I was going to start one right now for us." @ CAPS3 ", she said as she walked out, I wrote a letter telling daddy you could have said goodbye but you left. Well I would have waited @ CAPS4 never passed any sign of letter from him. I got home from school the same day. sad @ CAPS7 or @ CAPS7 daddy ? " @ CAPS5, honey nothing for you. "I started growing up still without letters. The brothers and sisters @ CAPS2 received them but not me @ CAPS6 felt forgotten." @ CAPS7 why didn't I receive a letter from daddy but everyone she said "I don't know". @ CAPS3. "I sent him a letter every day. I didn't get a single letter, I started to wonder why. Did he hate me? Did he not want to talk to me? he forgot one? I "@ CAPS9 @ CAPS7 shouted" @ CAPS1 "" you have mail "I walked down the stairs to the kitchen and it was something on the counter for me @ hard CAPS6 @ CAPS2 name on @ CAPS6 and @ CAPS6 did not say who @ CAPS6 was from. "@ CAPS7 which is @ CAPS6 from" open @ CAPS6 and find out "@ CAPS3" I slowly picked up the letter and began to read it. Ne @ CAPS5 I haven't written to go yet but maybe that will make @ CAPS6 "@ CAPS12 you more than everyone else @ CAPS12 daddy I open the package and @ CAPS6 was @ CAPS2 dads are us and his ransacked with all the letters he sent her and all. I read and read that they all had a cashier form that in all the envelopes and that night he called and said "but, I @ CAPS12, whatever @ CAPS1 keeps alot- ding so say soon."
The patient is where you can wait or stay put for someone or something. Some people can be very, very patient. But others don't have a patient at all. Like you're in line at the store and someone has a lot of stuff and you're in a bit of a rush. Now you could be rude and yelling, him or her yelling and all that crazy mess or you could wait patient and maybe she will let you cut. This is what the patient is to me.
Patience is one of the most important life skills in the world. It's great to have my best friend across the street. He has @ NUM1 older sister, named @ LOCATION1. @ LOCATION1 has been blessed with Downs Syndrome. Essentially, that means she doesn't understand things as quickly as you and me. You can also see it by the way she acts. @ LOCATION1 is one of the happiest people I have ever met. Knowing @ LOCATION1 as well as I do also has a downside. You have to be extremely patient. Talking to her, many people gave up and left because she didn't understand, but her closest friends developed a patient like no other. Having @ LOCATION1 as a neighbor is one of the greatest things that could have happened. She made me a master in one of the most important life skills. @ LOCATION1 is a wonderful person and I guess a great teacher, but when you are having a bad day be thankful because not everyone is as blessed as you are.
It was a hot day @ DATE1 at @ CAPS1, my family and I went to @ ORGANIZATION1. We did all the rides. Our last one was @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. The queue was short when we walked there. When we got there, the queue was up to the train. It was like waiting for a pig to fly. My brother and I had to go to the bathroom. My father and my mother stayed to save our places. When we came back my parents were another comeback. "@ CAPS4 are we that far back ?" my brother said. My parents stood in line for a drink. Ten families wanted to line up. We waited and waited until something spontaneous happened to us. All ten families were on the wrong row, so we had to be in front (behind three other families). My family and I had so much fun it was worth the wait.
Everyone should have patience. Everyone has patience, it depends if it's a long patience or a short patience. People always say " Patience is green ". @ CAPS1 needs a lot of patience for what to do, especially if he is a @ NUM1 level teacher. When you walk into @ NUM2 all the way, teachers expect older children / young adults to behave well. Now, if you have a job that you are focusing on adults for, your patience might not be high / long. Like my father, he is a lawyer, he deals with adults, his patience is not close to that of my mother. My mom still takes care of adults but grew up with four brothers but was the oldest. My dad expects people to be on time within minutes. Every time I say come and get me at seven, he'll be there at seven. Now my mom comes to get me and I say seven hours, it might take ten minutes anyway. This is my story about the people I know and "Patience".
Patience @ CAPS1 and my mom were sitting in the bus and we were going to go to the store for groceries, then go shopping for school clothes. My sister didn't really want to go but my mom did so she was already crazy about it but we went to get some food that she apparently didn't like, but it was just normal! Self-esteem and greedy. “ We are here, ” my mother said. We are at @ CAPS2 for shopping at my sister's house. She doesn't like @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 or @ CAPS5 or it's like me because she doesn't think she can fit them but anyway we do and she doesn't see anything "she likes" so she starts to throw a tempestan ?? my mom was so patient with her. I couldn't believe it so we lost her name and she took @ CAPS1 by my side.
It was @ DATE1 and @ PERSON4 was in class messing around at his desk as usual. @ PERSON4 is generally not the patient type of a person. Then her teacher asked the class a question and @ PERSON4 had thought in her head that was one of the best answers. @ PERSON4's hand went up in the air. One of the first hands up. "@ CAPS1 ! Lots of answers. Says <@ NUM1 </PERSON> berry. @ PERSON1 berry is quite a round person, with big, thick glasses to see. But all the students love her as a @ CAPS2 teacher," @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 what's your answer ? ” @ CAPS5 I was just scratching my head. Ok @ CAPS6. “ Tongue @ CAPS7 ? ” @ CAPS8 correct answer though.” There were about @ NUM2 more hands left air. In @ PERSON4's head, he just wanted to blurt out his answer but he knew that this time he was going to at least try to be patient. "@ CAPS9 these last @ NUM3 people and then we'll go @ CAPS5. " exclaimed <@ NUM1 </PERSON> berry. @ PERSON4 was raging impatiently in his head but outside he looked as calm as he could get. " @ CAPS10 ". @ PERSON3 said. " @ CAPS11 a metaphor? " @ CAPS10 replied. " @ CAPS13, you are right, that was a metaphor. " " @ CAPS14 damn that was my answer! " @ PERSON4 mumbled under his breath. But even though another comrade class took his response, @ PERSON4 was happy because he knew he was waiting patiently.
Snap! I had just shot myself in the foot with a pistol @ CAPS1. It all happened when my sister received a gun for her birthday. I approached a target and prepared to scream, that's when I got hit, I went to scream, that's when I got hit. I went to my over and told her what happened. The next day we went to the doctor to examine my foot. The doctor had about @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 patients there, not including me. My mom said "@ CAPS2 might take a while. I'm a person with hardly any patience at all. We waited and waited and waited an hour. Today wasn't my day as a kid. She called a person's name, it was hot mine. We waited a total of @ NUM3 hours, then the doctor finally called my name. After the @ CAPS1 was removed, I went home to sleep. It was a moment when I had to be patient.
Patience! Being patient can make you want and I'm going to tell you a story about how I got what I wanted by being patient. It @ DATE1; two weeks before my birthday I requested a male scooter. I was told I was too young for one. Of course, I was upset, I was furious. I waited a few days, but I didn't understand. I waited another week, I still did not understand. When my birthday arrived, (@ DATE2), I finally got my matai scoot ! I was so happy! This is why people should be patient because you might get what you ask for!
One time I was patient was when my grandparents and I were driving to Florida. It took about a day and a half to arrive. Then it took us six hours to get to @ LOCATION2. My uncle @ PERSON1, his wife and four boys also went. They had rented a house for us to stay with them. On @ DATE1 which was next, we went to @ LOCATION1 to see my grandfather's sister @ PERSON2. It took us about an hour and a half because we got lost. The last time we went to Florida was to see my cousin @ CAPS1 get @ CAPS2. No, her little sister was receiving @ CAPS2, I couldn't wait to see them. The wedding was @ CAPS3, I couldn't figure it out. So I waited for it to end. After the wedding, we returned to my aunt's house. On @ DATE2 we went to the flea market and it was huge. It took us an hour to look at everything. I wanted to go to stand 55 but had to buy something for my mom and dad. So again, I waited patiently for us to leave. On @ DATE3, we left to go home. We came here to @ NUM1 in @ TIME1. I was so tired that I almost fell asleep on the floor. So all the way back and forth I waited patiently.
Being patient is a very important skill to have. You need it to live your life. Without patients, your life would be very crazy. Once I was patient and had to wait for him when the time was right, it felt good. One day about @ NUM1 years ago. I went to @ ORGANIZATION1. And if you've been there, you know how long the lines are. They can last up to about an hour and a half. I was waiting my turn to go to the haunted house. It sounded like a lot of fun. Then when I got there it looked like there were @ NUM2 people online at that time. My mom asked me, "@ CAPS1 do you want to do a different trick then come back and do the Hannah that I love ?" I told him no and we stood in line. After about @ NUM3 hours online, there were only about @ NUM4 people in front of my mom and me. Then it was finally our turn when I sat in the chair and got tied up, it was good to know that after waiting a long time I did, I was patient. I took a look and asked if it was our turn, I just stayed patient. It was then that I realized I had been patient. I knew then that I could really do it, patient. This is an important skill to have and to help you live your life well without it going crazy.
I was once a patient when I broke my arm. I was there for @ NUM1. I was playing outside and climbing on a pole and I fell and put a @ CAPS1 on it and he swore. My doctor was very calm. And kind. In conclusion it's a time I was a patient
Once I was patient was when I was in line to go check out @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 the line was so long that I had to leave but I didn't want to lose my place in the line so when I picked up the pace, the line was longer than outside so I was patient so when I walked into the movie I was so mad I came home and slept .
Patience, @ CAPS6 essential part of our world. Patience @ CAPS5 is definitely something everyone needs. but not everyone has. I believe everyone needs patience because everything takes time. And if you "don't have time" to do something, then you don't have time to live. And if no one had time to live, I wouldn't be here right now. I believe that patience @ CAPS5 more than its definition. I believe that means being able to spend a little time in order to be able to do something. If all you did was work, then well have a pretty boring life. For example, if you had a teacher @ CAPS1 for the optional course @ CAPS6. She would have to be patient to be able to teach you the language of @ CAPS1. Otherwise, she probably wouldn't be a teacher. Another example would be let's say you are on @ NUM1 and go to @ LOCATION1. But @ CAPS5 traffic is holding you back because of a stack of @ NUM2 cars. and you honk. It's not going to speed things up any more than they already are. Maybe your @ CAPS5 timing is perfect when honking your horn, but it doesn't do anything to go faster. When people hear someone honking, it most likely appears as "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 PERSON @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9". @ CAPS10 @ CAPS5 about correct. When you honk in traffic nothing speeds up, things seem to take longer, and people instantly tag you as @ CAPS11. In conclusion, I would like to state that patience @ CAPS5 is important for humanity because if no one had patience, no one would be on earth at this time.
A lime that I was patient with was last year every day I had to be patient, because of my aunt. last year my aunt picked me up from the back of school one day, i was not sure if she was picking me up, as this time it was the first day of school and i didnt know what that was happening. I didn't know who was going to get me. I didn't have a phone so I couldn't call Mane. There, I waited to be patient at school. While I was waiting with my friend at his house, I went back to school and waited. For about @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 minutes or what seemed like an hour my aunt picked me up.
My neighbor was very patient when he killed that dollar @ NUM1 point for the first time ! It was??? and proud to have caught this beautiful white tail deer !. He said he had never been so proud before. He went out to dinner and I remembered the faces of my neighbors when he told me I was so happy for him. If I had had the money I would have had something for @ NUM1-point buck. When I could see the head my jaw dropped, it was the most beautiful deer I have ever seen.
@ PERSON2 came out of his warm house and out into the cold, blowing air. He walked slowly, staggering over the ice, to the barn. The barn was unlike any other. It was a sloping barn. @ PERSON3 has trained many softball pitchers and receivers in this barn, including me. I was already in the barn and turned on the heat. I warmed up by doing wrist movements, ks , leg toss, arm circles and screwball movements. My receiver, @ PERSON1, caught the ball every time. @ PERSON3 said, @ CAPS1. Let me see your screw ball and your climb ball. "I took my place on the mound and threw my screw ball. It bent to the right and the glove cracked." "@ CAPS2 ! Excellent ! Hey you ! Give me a high five ! " @ PERSON1 said. I slapped her hand and we both said "@ CAPS3!" “@ CAPS4, @ CAPS4 good. Now throw me a raise,” @ PERSON2 said. I started one. @ PERSON3 gave me directions after throwing three climb balls. “You are doing fine. Just keep your legs open and your arm a little higher,” he said. He never lost patience with me. Never after a climb, the ball almost touched the ceiling. He just continued to work with me. After many other locations, I finally understood. We finished our pitch session ten minutes later. @ PERSON3 told me I was doing great. He said we would work on it again on @ DATE2. "@ CAPS5 is @ DATE1. Isn't it?" I asked "@ CAPS6 day !" he said cheerfully. He gave me a hug. I like @ PERSON3. Not just because he's my dad. He is also a great man. Happy, funny, sweet and patient @ PERSON3. "
Once, when me, my dad was supposed to go to the races. But I had to wait for my dad to tell me he was working @ NUM1 hours and that's when the races start. It takes an hour to get there so I knew we were going to be late and not be able to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. So I was patient while playing in my room with all my toys. I was afraid I wouldn't go at all. @ CAPS1 I decided to take a nap. Later I felt something hit me, I opened my eyes and saw my dad, he said get up to go to the races. I was so happy. We got there and found out that we had the wrong time, we were an hour early. So I was able to meet the drivers and sit in these cars. And this weekend, they were racing three hundred laps. It was the end of the racing season of the year. They first did the three hundred lap race. @ CAPS1 they figured eight boat races. After that, they took part in the school bus derby race. I was so happy that you were there and to see the school bus race. A little kid said " now how am I going to get to school over there crashing all the school buses ". @ CAPS1 the race was over I thanked my dad for taking me to the races and not being late to meet the drivers and sit in their cars. We got home and went to @ CAPS2.
When I went to @ LOCATION1 with my family I had to be patient. Our flight left at @ TIME1 am so we were there at @ NUM1. We waited two hours. No one complained because we each had something to do. Me and @ PERSON1 were playing video games and my mom was reading. When we finally got on the plane it took us three hours to get to @ LOCATION1 and no one complained either. So this is the story of the time when nobody complained for five hours!
On a very hot summer day my mom, I and @ CAPS1 all stayed at the Best Western. The reason is that we don't have air conditioning and we melt like ice. So when we got there, there was a pool! We went up to our room and put on our swimsuits, went down to the pool, found a spot and put our towels there. But, everyone had to go out for a chemical cleanup. I was burning with anger and disappointment, but calmed down and waited. Expected, and waited and waited, no one could still enter. It had been about fifteen minutes so far and everyone was just losing their minds. And finally a buzzing ringing in your ears! But that meant food was ready at the snack bar, so it gave me hope, but they fell back. Waiting, still waiting, then a voice said, "Okay, everyone's back in the pool." I was delighted with those words, and I ran and then I jumped in! It took about half an hour, although it wasn't worth it, it was still fun. So maybe the next time something takes a while, I'll try to be less restless and happier, maybe.
Once I was patient, it was my home when it was my turn to play the game. I waited a while, so I went to my friends the last to sit down and watch I don't am never patient when there is food at stake i don't like to wait for my food sucks when i have to wait. I don't know of any other time I've been patient, I don't like to be patient.
There I was on a cold @ DATE1 @ TIME1. Still almost black. I hunted in my blind with my dad so calmly we could hear a fly flying. I had to be very patient because the slightest movement could frighten a deer. We sat there for almost @ NUM1 hours without even making a sound. For me, being patient was difficult, but I did. I was in the woods being patient and soon enough a deer came. I had to be patient and wait for his head to drop so I could get up and shoot him. It took about @ NUM2 minutes. But it was worth it because I ended up shooting the deer and my family and I all got to eat deer for dinner.
Today I had @ CAPS1 Patient @ CAPS2 from the meap. The meap is one day @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 @ CAPS3. He has writing, reading, math. It is the most difficult thing you will have to do in school. I think it's the hardest thing in life, but it helps you learn a lot more and it might help you in your future jobs.
A time when I was patient. One time I was patient was when I was at grade @ NUM1. When I was in class @ NUM1 my teachers said we should write a story about our patience. So once upon a time there was a girl named @ PERSON1 who wasn't a patient, so the hole world knew her as the no patient. @ PERSON1 hated that name so she thought to let go and she said @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I make them @ CAPS3 calling me that. So @ PERSON1 went around her street and asked everyone @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I @ CAPS3 being called the patient. NO body would tell him the answer so @ PERSON1 threw up out loud @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I @ CAPS3 being called The patient. Then @ PERSON1 heard a voice it was an old man called @ CAPS4 and he said I don't @ CAPS1 you @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 being called that way @ PERSON1 said @ CAPS1 if you please tell me. All you have to do is be patient. Then @ PERSON1 thought I should be patient. So what @ PERSON1 did was she went to the store and you don't know what she did she stood in line and she was patient so when everyone went they said good job @ PERSON1 and everyone stopped calling her non patient.
Have you ever been patient? I, once, me, mom, dad and sister went to @ CAPS1. When we arrived they gave us a number and told us to wait. I was patient, sitting there, quietly waiting. Then @ NUM1 later we had a table. We all sat down and told our waitress what we wanted to drink. Then we all looked at the menu and found what we wanted. The waitress came back and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said steak and my dad too, my mom and sister had mini tocos. She said okay and our food would be available soon. Well, it turns out she was far away. We were sitting there for @ NUM2. My mom wanted to leave but the rest of us said no and waited patiently. Finally after @ NUM2 @ NUM4. Our food came out and we were happy. The only downside is that the mini tocos were frozen. So we have just requested our invoice. The waitress came back and gave us the bill, luckily it was not frozen. We paid our bill without leaving a tip and off we went. After that my mom thanked me for being so patient and we never went again.
Sometimes I have patience and sometimes I do. Being patient means being @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 the right traits of a leader. Without patience, you will win @ CAPS5 in everything you do. So be a leader, a person who @ CAPS4't @ CAPS5 up. Be a person you love and be all that you can be. Remember, patience is everything.
Have you ever waited for something that seemed so @ CAPS1 far away, that seemed to take so @ CAPS2 to get there, but in the end it all paid off ? I have, just @ DATE1 I took the @ CAPS3.AT to enter the @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7, also known as @ CAPS8, (@ NUM1- @ CAPS9) I had to wake up to @ NUM2 am, on a @ DATE2, to prepare. I had to beat @ ORGANIZATION1 to @ NUM3. When I arrived I had to stand in line for @ NUM4 minutes to find out which room I would take the test in. It took @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11 to pass the test ! With three breaks! However, when I was done and left my room engulfed in the crowd of about @ NUM5 other kids taking the test, I met my mom who gave me encouraging smiles and big hugs. Since my three best friends also took the, we all found ourselves solo and hiked around campus. It turned out to be a great day!
@ CAPS6 was @ NUM1 the night, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and I was so excited to find out what I got for @ CAPS1 the next day. I couldn't fall asleep at all because I was so excited about this amazing day to get my gifts and celebrate @ CAPS1. I love @ CAPS1 because of all the joy, fun and happiness in everyone's mind @ CAPS6 is very rewarding and good to wait for things because if you wait then good things will come to you and to those around you sometimes i already know some of the things i got (because my mom is a bad hiding place) for @ CAPS1 i am patient with others because i wish they were also patient with me . Treat others as you would like to be treated. I think @ CAPS1 is the happiest time of the year, right ? @ CAPS6 is fun to commune with pets, friends and family because you get along so well, that's my patience answer. Thanks for your time @ CAPS9
I chose to write a story my way about patients. Patients are the length of time you can wait for something or someone. Like in a restaurant, be patient and wait for your food. In a plane holding area, be patient for the plane to land and prepare for departure. These are the things I know about patience.
I'm being, trying to be patient right now. You see @ CAPS1 my birthday approaching my cell phone not working that ??? I told my mom I needed a new phone. It is unreadable so I have to be patient just hoping and we do something ??? very cool! @ CAPS1 is nv @ CAPS2. I do not know which ??? Being patient is really bad. Being patient does not mean whining ?? no and mw shouts. The patient can sometimes come up with ??? this ??? . so i will be patient and see how it goes.
I have to be patient all the time when teaching my puppy (@ PERSON1) right from wrong when are you patient ? @ PERSON1 is a new part of my family and he's still learning right from wrong. I try to teach him things everyday and when I reread it like @ NUM1 times I go a little crazy. Mom tells me that @ PERSON1 is learning and being patient with him, it helps him train faster ! I have to be patient when I teach @ PERSON1 new things and if I am patient he will learn faster
It was a @ @ DATE1 TIME1 cold and grade football teams @ NUM1 and @ NUM2 playing at the moment different a @ a @ NUM3 and NUM4 and of course there was CAPS1 @ leaders, and I was just one of them . The match starts around @ NUM3 hours and we started to cheer. After about @ NUM3:15 we were getting very cold, we were getting our warm-ups ready but we were still cold. So now that we were cold we were getting a little cranky. At half-time it was even colder. We all took a brake and went for some hot chocolate. Of course, we were in a hurry to get back to the stands to sit down, well I started to walk faster and faster then I dropped my hot cholate in front of me. Well I was angry but I'm a leader @ CAPS1 so I must be happy. Then we started clapping again and it was colder than when we started but we kept clapping but some of the @ CAPS1 leaders decided they want to warm up and if more people want to take them off, well all have to take them out so we did. And we froze but we held on until the end of the @ NUM7 match. Then we all got home and probably went to bed.
I think patience comes into play in a lot of places. For example, you have to be patient to get a job, otherwise the boss will kick you out of the building without saying a word to you. Another place where you would have to be patient to be successful. If you are moaning and moaning because something is taking too long to happen, it is not patience. The best thing to do would be to get up and try to do something about it. Finally, if you have to wait so you don't get it right away, if you're making money from your job, you're not just going to steal the place, you have to be patient and you have to wait.
I was at an airport at @ LOCATION1 once. We were returning from @ LOCATION2. After getting off the plane, we had to go through customs. There were only two people working for the citizens of @ LOCATION3. The line was very long. After half an hour, we were only halfway through the line. There was a lot of waiting and a lot of whining but we finally made it through. Of course, they all thanked us for our patience and once the passport was stamped we were on our way to the next flight.
Once upon a time there was a young girl named @ CAPS1 who lived with her father and mother in a small town in @ PERSON2. It was mom in a small town from @ PERSON2. It was almost her birth and she was so excited for this birthday because she was twelve. Twelve was a lucky number here since she was little. Her mom said they could go to town and go to the chef @ PERSON1 and eat out, she agreed. That morning, she woke up and dad made her some pancakes with fresh strawberries on them. @ CAPS1 hated milking the cows there because they are so stubborn so she went there and listened to the cows in just @ NUM1 minetts. @ CAPS1 went back inside and put the milk on the table. @ CAPS1 was starting to wonder if she was going to get a birthday present, @ CAPS1 decided that it would be better for her to be patient when her mother came home from work (she works in a clothing store), she has said "Are you ready to go eat", jumped @ CAPS1 "And scream yes, yes. So they went into town and parked at the restaurant, they got in and the lights went out. yelled "@ CAPS3 you, @ CAPS3 you, @ CAPS3 you, and on one table there were twelve presents, and under the table was a dog." His mother and father gave him a dog. She names the Wonder Dog because every time she sees him, she begins to wonder about his wonderful life. And she's learned that the great thing comes when you're patient.
To be patient is to wait and not to be frustrated. When my family and I went to the @ LOCATION1 and @ LOCATION1 state game. My father was patient and this is unusual because he is normally patient. We were therefore surprised. when we entered the stadium there was a line of people not thinking and @ CAPS1 sat in our seats so we waited for security to tell them to move it took them about half an hour to find because my dad was patient but the @ CAPS1 in our house couldn't wait and we started to get very angry when security came we had to wait for them to know our barn he was still patient and afterwards this we got seats i was latte but the rezzon my dad was patient was because he didn't want to be kicked out of the stadium so he stayed patient and stayed calm.
When I was at Cedar Point, I had a lot of patience. I went to Cedar with my friend @ PERSON1 the last @ DATE1 or @ NUM1 @ DATE1 ago. It was my first time and it was like @ NUM2 time of @ PERSON1. We did so many rides but the bad thing was the lines. The lines were huge! At first I wasn't very patient, but after a while I had patience and my friend doesn't. My friend wanted to go on the dragster but I didn't. She forgot it was my first time. After hours of incredible walks. The lines have grown longer. My parents didn't have patience at the time, but my friend did. I was funny because it's the other way around most of the time. Sometimes I wish people were more patient. But I don't know if that will happen.
Do you have patience? Well if you're like us. But now I have that in a guy ??? patience his name is @ CAPS1.M. @ CAPS1.M digs the secret of patience which helps him a lot does he talk a lot ??? ??? “ A bit like once, we had to give in. But and, we stood in line for three hours! @ CAPS2 dolo care even if he was just giant ??? ??? One ? we were outside playing and we had quite a live mesl ho got bitten five times but i didn't complain about the pain from @ CAPS4. I have a little patience but not as much as @ CAPS2. But @ CAPS2 is not a prefect when in a hurry, he has no patience and I have a why in the file. The only time @ CAPS2 showed the patience needed was ?? her mother's car broke down in the whirlwind of ?? And @ CAPS4 was out of winter so the car was cold @ CAPS4 took nine hours for a four kuck to get hit and it threw her mom on the ?? but not him before ??? when it finally arrived but ??? had a nice way @ PERSON1 and they went to @ ORGANIZATION1 lets get some food. @ CAPS2 has the most patience I have ever felt.
One day I went to the store with my mom and there was the old lady @ CAPS1 in front of us she couldn't do anything she was moving very slowly And I know she is the old lady @ CAPS1 . But she was moving very slowly and some people really do n't have the patient's @ CAPS2.
There's only one time a year that I'm patient for something, and that's @ CAPS1. I can never wait for @ CAPS1 to come. I got to see my brothers, uncles, aunts, cousins, everyone. It's the best time of year and it's the night next to my birthday.
There was a time when I had to go to my doctor for a monthly check-up. When we got to the building my aunt and I realized there were more cars than usual. When we got inside, we noticed a flyer said "@ NUM1 hits @ DATE1 threw @ DATE2". @ CAPS1 when we took the elevator to the fourth floor and entered the waiting room we saw @ NUM2 people. Fortunately not everyone was waiting @ PERSON1, but I had to wait an hour and forty-five minutes. @ CAPS1 when I finally got to see my doctor she gave me an injection and assured me that I was fine. After a long day, I came home to take a big nap.
I once had to be patient when we went with family to @ LOCATION1 to see family and friends ! We had a big work trip placed there very few tires, we were patent through the trip as the flight that took @ NUM1 hours the whole thing gave me then @ NUM1 more hours in the air for a part of the trip we hiked the road the one who sits right next to the pacific above a little black sedan and reached from this one we can for the fist is mine is then when we went to a looking place stogie attraction was for in tec one ove said of me is a gas hill and the other the acer thom to ride somsty bike I sleep and listen to the radio for almost an hour but @ NUM3 hours then refinay stopped at san @ CAPS1 after staying there we have a plan for the homer @ NUM4 ½ hour trip @ CAPS2 to atlanta @ LOCATION2 it was in a logical plane with a middle section and the other two we were in the middle. On either side of us were students screaming from across the hall. I tried to sleep but it was very uncomfortable that we were having the most uncomfortable plane trip of my life, but I had to be patient and how it's over.
Patience is being in control of yourself, write as you wait. To be patient, you have to wait for what you expect to be done. @ CAPS1 means to be calm. For example, if you go to the doctor for an annual check-up, you should sit in the waiting room for at least an hour before they call you. But sometimes patience is. Like when you wait in a pizzeria to deliver your pizza @ CAPS1 takes about @ NUM1 minutes, but you ask me, a @ CAPS1 is something someone sets up. Not that people have patience
One day me, my mom, my dad, my sister, my brother went to transfer mouitan. So we had to wait a long time and then finally we got to the first row, we took our places then we sat down and then we had to wait a long time for a waiter. So we were singing songs until our server. Then she came I said faster. Then she came. Then we had our drinks and our food and then we ate our food drinking our drinks and came home and that's when I was pacified.
Once, when I was patient, I was rewarded. Just a few weeks ago, my science teacher classed a leaf project. We had to collect @ NUM1 sheets to get @ PERCENT1. When I started to collect my leaves, I had to squeeze and dry them. To make this to a sheet, you will need to put the sheets in newspaper and then put books on the newspaper so that the water runs off the leaves on the newspaper. It takes a long time to do this process and sometimes you have to do it several times for each sheet. I had to be patient as the first due date was approaching, but mom told me to form my project on the next due date. So since I was patient my project was completed before the second due date and got @ NUM2 extra points. So when your patient, you can be rewarded
My mom and I were on our way to Sonco's house. We stopped near a train, and it was going very slowly and my mom and I were patiently waiting but my mom after a few minutes wanted to ternanon but we stopped and it was done.
I once got money for my birthday i wanted to buy an electric scooter @ CAPS1 on the weekend always waited for my dad to come home @ CAPS1 he didn't have to work @ CAPS1 we looked at and found two that I liked. One was a gasoline powered scooter and the other an electric scooter. We went to see the gasoline scooter and it was a lot of money and had a bunch of snacks on it @ CAPS1 we called the person with the electric scooter because I didn't like the gasoline scooter and we were went to ??? ??? and i got it and paired it with @ MONEY1 and it was oriyiek @ NUM1 @ MONEY1 @ CAPS1 I got home and rode for three days and I was ??? it's a night and we went to the garage and it got out of hand ??? we thought it was the fuse ??? that was the controller and the part that everything connects to it @ CAPS1 we called the company and ordered the part and they sent us the wrong one and we told them it was not the right one and they sent the same again @ CAPS1 it fell off the desk and we forgot it @ CAPS1 I have now ordered it again and they said this time they are sending the correct checks. @ CAPS1 I have waited about @ NUM2 years to @ NUM3 months.
Patience is, by definition, being understanding and tolerant. I am not patient, I understand but I am not that tolerant. Some people, however, are tolerant and understanding or patient. Here is the story of a person I know who is tolerant. In class @ NUM1 my math teacher's assistant must have been very patient with us because he was asking the same questions over and over again. She would teach the lesson and have to relearn it before living questions. I was in the advanced group so we went fast and never really had to ask any questions. I could never be as patient as she taught these people.
Once I had to wait very patiently. One afternoon my brother @ CAPS1 went to get some car parts. Then everything happened, out of nowhere a car drifts in its lane then @ CAPS2. Since our truck did not have airbags, this was a bad situation. The other driver was in a pickup truck with air bags. About @ NUM1 minutes later my mom got a call about what happened. Then we rushed as fast as we could until we saw the crash. Had to wait in the car until my dad came back to get @ CAPS1. I waited patiently and prayed that he would be okay. And luckily, my prayers were answered. It just has bumps and bruises. But the car was towed away. Later we went to a truck to collect our things. And see what happened to the truck, the damage to the truck was not as bad as what happened to the other drivers' van. We picked up the truck a few weeks later. But I'm glad I still have my brother.
I'm going to tell you about the time when I had to have patience while taking this @ CAPS1! It all started a few minutes ago… I entered the classroom prepared for anything. I clearly wasn't, because four minutes later I have this thing in front of me. So I started by thinking about the time when I used patience. This weather was good as everything. Now don't get me wrong, I understand why we take the @ CAPS1, for… uh, I think it's to help us learn, or to hurt our hands and cramps, I don't know, really. Writing about patience is very difficult because you can lose it very quickly. But the @ CAPS1 is the @ CAPS1, and I think it's the best I can, so the story has to go on! It's very quiet here, and the smell of pencil and paper is very long. My eyes are tired and I can't help but let out a loud yawn roar. My hand is asleep and every second you hear a " sniff ", " sniff ", " sniff " ... " sniff ", " snot." We're not out loud to get up, so we're stuck “ sniff ”, “ sniff ”, “ snot ” for a whole hour. When you are a child, whoever notes this, have you ever taken this test, or any part of it ? Well, it's none of my business, whatever. Yeah ! My hand is really sore! One second, (shake, shake, shake, crack) there is better. Patience is a virtue, but whatever. You probably don't have the patience to read this, so let me end by saying this… by writing about patience, but now I'm done. (Yes!)
Once I had a lot of paitenits was when I sprinted my only ice skate. I was doing pirouettes and cheats all over the place, and I didn't land. I fell on my back, but the bone that I injured was my arm, my mom was surprised that I could even stand up because of the force of my fall. My arm hurt so much because of it. So my mom rushed over to help me, then we had to go home. The next morning it hurt @ NUM1 more times. I had to go to the doctors to get x-rays, and they took two weeks to develop. So I was in two weeks of pain. So it turns out that I didn't break my arm, but was in great pain while waiting for the results. It took me a long time to just wait, and, wait, and wait for these radios,
It was a cold autumn afternoon. I meant my grandfather was on a hunting trip. We had geneat in the morning @ CAPS1 nolvek. I didn't know what would happen that day. We set up blind on the ground at around @ NUM1. From what we saw it would be a long afternoon. We sat there @ NUM2 hours @ CAPS1 it seemed like an eternity. We waited and waited @ CAPS1 still no deer. All of a sudden, my heart races at the sight of our blind. We drew the biggest one I had ever seen. It was a deer the size of a monster. @ NUM3. @ NUM4 feet high and @ NUM5. Shelf. I loaded my special @ NUM6 and pulled it in the shoulder. I was so excited I almost screamed. As in any story, there is a lesson. Some people respect your elders. @ CAPS1 mine is that patience is rewarded. and as you can see I was rewarded.
I was patient once. I don't want a birthday party. So my mom and dad talked about it. So my mom and I went to @ LOCATION1, we got to play almost all of the games (we didn't go play dummies) and went cart twice, then we went to buy some new video games and music. new dirt bike gloves. It was a time when I was patient so I could do something fun.
"Patience is a virtue." I hear this saying over and over again in my mind. " Patience is a virtue, patience is a virtue ". I never really thought about it until I go keep my cousins for the first time. My cousin @ PERSON2, who only has about @ NUM1, does whatever you say. It is easy to keep. But my other cousin, @ PERSON3, he has to follow his own agenda. Not that I don't like him, just that I think he must be one of the hardest little kids to give up. We started off pretty well that morning. we had a snack, played around the room for a while, did some crafts and watched a movie. A few hours before my aunt came home, @ PERSON1 pooped in her diaper. Now I have dealt with alot of diapers of poo before, @ CAPS4, I wasn't too worried. I placed @ PERSON1 on the changing table and removed his diaper before realizing I had no wipes. I asked @ PERSON4 where they were, but he was playing with those bottles of milk. "@ PERSON4, I need you to go get some wipes please. Now." @ PERSON1 was squirming now and I had to hold her back if I didn't want to poop all over the house. “ I know, but I can't ” “ Well, why can't you ? " " @ CAPS1 I don't want to. " I started to lose my temper when I realized the saying "patience is a virtue". I took a deep breath and realized that I was feeling what the patient must be feeling. "@ PERSON4 I bet you can't go get them as fast as a cheetah !" "@ CAPS2 I can!" "@ CAPS3, prove it." @ CAPS4 he did. And I realized that you would get things done faster if your patience and cunning could come to you.
I wondered who would win. I just hoped I would. I was nervous. I was also a little scared. I didn't know what was going on. I have been very patient in finding out who won the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 contest. I was waiting for the end of the competition. A little earlier I played the game. I was currently in first place. I was nervous. I was nervous because if I win I will get two tickets to @ LOCATION1's @ CAPS3. I sat quietly on a chair. I tried not to show that I was nervous. All I could do was wait for it to end. Then my mom said we can wait while doing rides at the fair. First of all, I went on the incline which I swirl. I wondered if anyone had beaten my score the whole way. Then we looked for another route. I tried not to think about the contest. Later we found a merry-go-round to continue. When we got there my mom told me I won. Fortunately, I returned to the place to claim my prize. When I waited it was scary, but it was worth it. I was nervous all the time. I tried not to think about it too. I was very impatient to want to do it again for a while. I told you when I was patient. When were you?

When I was patient. It was this @ DATE1 that we were going to this location at @ LOCATION1. It took us @ NUM1 hours to get there but we said forget we were at @ LOCATION1. But we weren't at @ LOCATION1. It was @ NUM2 minnight we were so sleepy we went to the vacation hostel and once we got to the room we fell asleep straight away then that morning we went for a swim then got up and went to the @ LOCATION1 pack. My two cuzins pissed me off, I was about to kill them, they kept fighting and talking to each other. Then we finally got there around @ NUM3 pm, we had to take a little train to get there. The park was huge. The first round me and my sister and my p'tits cuzins was the commute. The we had on @ ORGANIZATION1, @ CAPS1 runney foleon and @ CAPS2 and that was a time when I was patient
I was at my friends' house one afternoon when she couldn't find something she needed. So we went to her sister, but she was on the phone, so we sat on the phone, so we just sat there patiently until she was done. We had sat there for about seven minutes and we were both hospitalized. We went to go and ask his mother. Guess she was busy, because she told us to sit down, be calm and patient. We sat down again for seven minutes, but she was still working. So we got up and went back to her sister's house. She didn't have the phone now, so my friend asked her sister where her nail polish was, but in a mean hospital tone. “ @ CAPS1 is in the drawer ! Now get out of my room, ”she yelled. After looking and searching, we finally found @ CAPS1. She's not that patient and I've learned that I'm not patient either. My friend was always patient but not her tone. This is the time when I know someone has been patient.
One day I woke up and looked outside, it was cold and snowy. I went into the living room and told my mom I was not feeling well so my mom checked my temptation and said I have one ??? I also had a runny nose so she said I probably had a cold. She had to go to work @ DATE1 and she said she would stay from work to stay home with me. So she would make me my hot chocolate and my breakfast whenever I needed something, she would get up and buy it for me. Whenever I needed something like a drink, food, or even another blanket, she would get up and take it from me. She was patient because every time I asked for something, she got it without complaining, she just did what I asked her to do. She even went to town to get me my medicine. This is why my mother is the best and the most patient.
I was to have a patient in @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2 we were to have a patient in @ CAPS3. The @ CAPS3 was @ CAPS4 here slow, we got a @ TIME1 the us @ CAPS5 it at @ NUM1 where we were in the @ CAPS3. For hours and in pants @ CAPS7 to @ CAPS3, I would @ CAPS9 go @ CAPS10 to the car and fall asleep. But I used the patient to go throw that @ CAPS3 and got the @ CAPS11 scering of a @ CAPS12. I asked patients to do something @ CAPS13.
There was a time when I had to be patient. My family and I were receiving pug puppies at @ NUM1 from a nice lady who lived at @ NUM2 minutes away. I was so happy when my parents made their final decision to buy them. We visited the @ NUM3 puppies longer while they were still very young. After our last visit, we had to wait three whole weeks as they must be old enough to return home with new families. These three weeks seemed to go by very slowly, but the whole wait paid off. Being patient gave me a chance to prepare for the puppies. We bought them beds, toys, crates and other dog essentials. We wanted to be ready for the new members of our family. The day has finally come to collect the puppies. They were so adorable! We took them home and let them explore all around our house. They loved it! Our pigs turned out to be very good dogs. I'm so glad I had to be patient while waiting for our pigs. I guess good things really happen to those who wait!
I had patience when my dad grumbled because we had to wait for the doctor to tell us we could see him, but after a while the doctor came over and said he had a seizure. heart disease, then a stroke. They @ CAPS1- @ CAPS2 him (my dad) and we waited about @ NUM1 minutes and we used about @ NUM2 tissue boxes. The doctor said "we will keep him overnight to watch him" @ CAPS3 the next day went to the hospital and after a blank they had to unplug the plug. I had patience in this store as I waited in the hospital lab and waited for the doctor to tell us what happened and when they took the @ CAPS1- @ CAPS5 and well when they said it had to be unplugged. @ CAPS3 this is my story about when I had patience.
I was a patient in the office doctor , so I believe. I was a patient because I ran my knc once and refreshed my coluler @ CAPS1 which makes me a patient. I almost forgot about the lump in my neck, so I'm ready to see my doctor.
Sometimes it can be hard to be patient, @ CAPS1 me this has to be something i want or want to do. It was a cool day at @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS2.CI had just had @ NUM1 and was going to meet the president @ PERSON1 face to face ! I won a competition that allowed me to do that. When we got to the White House, a man took us inside. He led us into a small room and then left. It was around @ NUM2 then. He said we couldn't go out because we might distract someone. So we waited to play hangman and see other @ CAPS3. Then it was around noon and I was hungry. Towards @ NUM1: 30pm @ PERSON1 has arrived ! He said "Do you want something to eat?" I said “yes”… .we went to this fancy restaurant that I can't pronounce. He said sorry @ CAPS1 for having to wait, but I didn't care if it was worth it.
I show loyalty to a lot of people that I don't have and they show me loyalty.
One time I was patient was when I did gymnastics. When trying to learn a new skill, patients are the key. For example, when I was learning a new skill on bars called a hand plaster, it was difficult. Day after day, I have never been able to do it. I put on my personal best day, but I had to be patient, my trainer said. He said when the day comes you will, but until then you have to keep trying and doing your best. It may take days, months, or even a year to learn this skill, but I just have to wait until the day my body does the skill it said. So I waited and waited. Tried and tried but still no results for my new skill. Finally, after four months of work, I did it. I got up on the bar and did it. All my waiting would be over. That day my trainer said to me, “ I told you you can do it, it just takes time and patience, but today was your day and you did it. It was a time when I had to use patience to learn my new skill. I have learned that being patient is difficult and all you can do is wait and see what patience will bring you.
Book @ CAPS1 'And the characters have lived happily ever after …… ..for now!' @ CAPS2! @ LOCATION1 closes the book, very sad that we have run out of pages. It was the third book in her series, and she absolutely needed the fourth. At school the next day, she went straight to the library. She opened the doors and was greeted by that dusty old book smell that she loved. @ LOCATION1 has queued for their favorite shelf, containing their favorite books. @ LOCATION1 scanned the shelves, quickly noting that the book was missing. She @ CAPS11 the librarian, @ PERSON2, about @ CAPS12, and was surprised to find the book already checked out. She put her name on the waiting list, embittered that her name was the tenth. The next day was @ DATE1. @ LOCATION1 went to the library @ CAPS11 @ PERSON1 @ PERSON2 about the book. The results are very disappointing to us. Her name was @ NUM1 which wasn't bad for one day, @ CAPS6 when she was home she was in a really bad mood. "@ CAPS3 is wrong !" @ CAPS11 his mother. "@ CAPS4, I really wanted this book, @ CAPS6 @ CAPS12 was already out. My name is @ NUM1 on the list, @ CAPS6 @ CAPS12 could last a long time until these other people finish. " @ CAPS4, I think that you have to learn a little bit of patience, "Mom said. " Patience? @ CAPS3 is that it? @ CAPS11 @ LOCATION1 “ Patience is when you expect something and don't complain about @ CAPS12. Take, for example, your great impatience. “@ CAPS6, I'm waiting,” @ CAPS7 said “@ CAPS8, @ CAPS6, you are complaining a lot." The next day @ LOCATION1 was as patient as she could be. She didn't go to the library to ask for the book, and she went all without complaining. Later. @ LOCATION1 has been called to the office. When she arrived she found @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1, the secretary. "@ CAPS9" said @ PERSON2. "@ CAPS3 is that it?" @ CAPS11 @ LOCATION1 “@ CAPS12 is the book you wanted. @ CAPS12 has been checked out to your account and ready to read. "@ CAPS13 you" said @ LOCATION1. She couldn't believe @ CAPS12 ! She finally has her book! The bottom line: Patience pays off, especially when you're willing to wait.
Once I was patient was when my family and I were going to get @ ORGANIZATION1's autograph. We stood in line for hours. My legs were screaming and aching but I didn't care, I was too excited to worry about anything. I just wanted his autograph and finally got it!
One day just before soccer practice, my lock on my locker got stuck. All of the @ NUM1 coaches tried to remove it. All except one, coach @ PERSON1. He stayed in the locker room with me trying to remove it. When we realized it didn't come off, we had to find the @ CAPS1. When we found it, we asked for bolt cutters. We had to walk through the school to pick them up. Once we got them we had to go back to the locker room. When we got there he tried to cut the lock. He tried for @ NUM2 min. They wouldn't work. So we had to walk through the school to the tool room and buy another pair. This one finally cut the lock after @ NUM3 min. I think it took a lot of patients from Coach @ PERSON1.
For this passage I am going to tell a story to the most patient person in the world. In the Old Testament a long time ago there was a man named @ PERSON1 @ NUM1 who was very rich, very happy and true to God. One day the devil pointed this out and, the devil said that @ PERSON1 would easily lead me away from God. God denied that so the devil said leave me ??? his crops and his cattle, let me go get his camel "God said 'good but no harm to @ PERSON1 himself", the devil laughed. in the says "A big fire has ??? and said: "@ CAPS1 your cattle were slashed by wolves carry the only one left, the other one I didn't put aside @ CAPS1 your cattle were bare they are wolves we are the only one left there 'other i didn't make it run i said hand towel stole @ CAPS1 your cold then ??? servant ??? in and self the roof had ??? in hall @ CAPS1 ta family was killed ''! I never thought that @ PERSON1 was started ??? become a dhowds started living on eth site, would curse god soon, the devil would come back, but this time @ PERSON1 was horribly ill, even though the next year he still wouldn't curse god. When and saw that he sent the devil away and hampered @ PERSON1, he blessed him with a new family and a new family, then @ PERSON1 was happy again
Long wait @ CAPS1 'only four' at the time. I had moved to @ LOCATION4. Yes, moved to @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION4 from @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS2. Fairly far south for me but I was a little girl who didn't care too much, too much. So I lived at @ LOCATION4, went to kindergarten, made friends, moved into a new house, and so on until I was seven. That's when I knew we were moving. Again, back to @ LOCATION3. Well, now I wasn't four years old. I had a lot of great friends here (especially two of them) and now I had to start all over again. I didn't hate the idea, but I didn't like it either. Sure. It didn't really matter. We were moving anyway and I knew from the start that I would have fun easily and make new friends. The only thing I didn't want to leave behind was old friends, memories and all the other things I loved about this place. So I took my memories away, promised to keep in touch with friends, and then moved on. Novi was different but good. There were a lot of changes to adapt to but it was pretty easy overall. I made lots of new friends that I now hang out with every day. I crept into life here as you slip into your bed every night. What I'm doing is fun and feels normal to me. I have been living here for four years now. I have exchanged letters, emails, events and memories with friends at @ LOCATION4 and friends here all this time. But even so, I can't wait to come back down for a visit. I patiently waited for this to happen. Now I think the patience is paying off because I can finally visit this year. My only difficulty was not seeing everyone. But not for long. I see all my friends here all the time and now I go to see my older friends too. Yep for me! I'm eager to ! For years of waiting provided me with an opportunity!
When I was bitten by a dog I was at @ LOCATION1 when it happened. The dog jumped up and bit me in the face. So my dad and his friend put me in the truck and we went to @ ORGANIZATION1 a hospital at @ LOCATION1. They made me sit in a hospital bed for @ NUM1 hours. Then I was sent to Hurly. And then I saturated the hospital while watching TV. still waiting for surgery. @ NUM2 hours later I got it. So overall I sat for @ NUM3 hours. And all the while, he could have infected himself. And I got a @ NUM4 so they can stay there @ CAPS1. But I had to have patience after all I was a patient.
I am patient for all thanks and @ CAPS1. I have to be patient with each thank you. I'm so hungry that I start to moan and I have to ??? ??? As a thank you giving us ??? ??? ??? ??? and ??? ??? like ??? ??? Turkey. I am so excited that I continue to sniffle. So oh I can now tell you about the dessert I love but we ??? like an hour later so I'm hungry so also thank you very much for giving ??? home my ??? homemade apple pie, oh like corn as they come in, I jump up and down. At @ CAPS1, I must be patient because I am always looking in the sun for what I am currently receiving ???? ?? with my name on it. If I find it is ??? my parents or grandparents tell me that we have to ??? first. Come here because I have to open my stocking.
Today was @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and @ PERSON1, the @ PERSON2, was so excited he was bordered by the walls! "I wonder @ CAPS8 @ PERSON3 will bring us," @ CAPS3 @ PERSON1, looking through a dog cat, "I want this and this, and this, oh, definitely that." “@ PERSON1, you have to be patient. @ CAPS1 is tomorrow and you have to do your part and help clean up the tree, ”@ PERSON1's mom says. “@ CAPS4, I've given gifts now ! ” @ PERSON1 moaned. "You know," his father said again, "@ CAPS5 you're not a good one @ PERSON2 Santa will only bring you peacock shells." @ CAPS6, @ PERSON1 give in and set, '@ CAPS7 okay, I'll help you out. @ CAPS8 appeared several hours later to @ LOCATION1, it was bedtime. It was a lot that he had been patient because he koew, in the @ TIME1 he would have gifts.
Patience. It was hot @ DATE1 @ TIME1 and I was at my sister's house playing Wii with my niece, when my brother-in-law Matt walks into the living room and says, "@ CAPS1 is bored, let's do something today" hui! all decided that we would go to Michigan Adventures for the day. My sister @ PERSON1 told us to pack the coler with snacks and drinks and put pillows and blankets in the back seat of the car. But we didn't realize that we actually had six hours at @ CAPS3 to switch to six flags and that @ PERSON1, Matt, and my mom had been planning this for weeks. After being in the car for two hours, I groaned "again are we here? '' 'No' . But I really have not thought about how I was lost because we have been Michigan adventures thousands of times before. For the rest of the trip I was pretty calm. In other words @ CAPS4 was very sleepy. When I woke up it was because my niece was shaking me. excitement. I stretched and I squinted because of the rise of the sun when my eye has adjusted to the light, I looked around me and I realized that we were at six flags ! When we got into the first ride we took the supeman on that ride you sit down and things get stuck around your legs and stomach and I tilt you to @ CAPS2 it's like you're flying, we wanted to ride it @ CAPS2 badly but the line was @ NUM1 Duration ½ hours While in line we found things to be done I'm like swinging and playing on the metal railing, playing spy and all kinds of stuff and when we finally got on and off the ride I realized it was really fun and worth it barely and that I was patient and did not complain.
My mother is very patient. The reason my mom is patient is that when she goes to the beauty salon she calls @ NUM1 hours of waiting, not long. Another reason she is patient is that if I don't do my chores, she doesn't get mad, she just asks me to do it again. My mother is also very patient when it comes to work because it does feel not frustrated when a lot of work to do like writing a paper Word @ NUM2
Patience is ??? our or pending ??? Patience is facing the teachers at school and trying to understand their point of view. Without patience you and your youngest sitting or young ??? the teacher is beating constantly . This is why patience is so important. Patience must be constantly discarded. In sport it helps ??? you have to base the rer whether it's a good call or a bad call. Patience too ??? because you are not going to be ??? of this the first ???. Patience makes perfect. School is a great place to be patient, so learning something new about management will be a ??? teacher. You have to use it when dealing with children as they are always trying to respond. from you if they are ??? wrong. In the end it's a ?? to call you ??. it's very important to have that ??? if these are small things ??? Learn or great things like testing. It is more to have patience than not.
There have been many times in my life that I have been patient and times that I have been patient. For example, the other day I asked my mom if she would lead me to a target where I could have some chewing gum. My mother told you but I had to do it with a small bill. I was patient while waiting for my mother to take me. When I got to target my mom told me to ??? at the top. I came across the ??? on pay ??? so I had to wait. Instead of getting angry, I was patient. Plus, instead of my mom getting mom, she was also patient. An example of my impatience is, approx. A week ago when I asked my dad to play ??? with me. There you have said but you have to wait a bit. I got very angry for some reason and lost my patience. I started screaming why I have to wait. I reached when I had pace and I was losing all patience. I said sorry and then we played wrestling.
Patience is one of the things people should have. I remember when I was in the store and my cousin wanted to come home and her mom was there and told me to wait. My cousin was impatient that day because she wanted to go home. I think this patient will get you through life. For example, if you were dating your friend and she was driving and you were tired and wanted to come home and you told her let go. So you were the one who was impatient because she was the one driving. Patience will always be one of the things we need to do. If you are patient, you could do things a lot better. Sometimes you have to wait for managers to call you to get the next job. But can't be impatient or you won't be hired for this job. You always have to be patient because you don't know what would happen if you weren't patient.
@ CAPS2 @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2- @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2- @ CAPS1 ! Sound sounds in cars @ CAPS11. All I can think of is after @ CAPS6 and lunch. I get more and more impatient as the clock ticks and @ CAPS11's heart beats. I don't like meap for this reason. During the reading selection, all I think is, "@ CAPS7 must be the boringest story in history," then I turn the page, @ CAPS8, @ CAPS7 one is, "@ CAPS9 me makes you so impatient. All I want is to finish the test. Small sweat bundles read @ CAPS9 slowly but I don't want to be the last to return @ CAPS9. In writing, I think "@ CAPS10 is what am I going to write about this ? ” @ CAPS11's hand starts to hurt and @ CAPS11's head pounding from everyone's pencil running like @ CAPS9 is in a horror movie. @ CAPS2- @ CAPS1, scribble-scribble, eek-eek, bom, bom, then you have to read over and over again, make sure you have a title and read the handwriting. The math segment is the most nervous of all . There are some questions I forgot. All math teachers seem to cram all @ CAPS9 into their heads @ CAPS11 at once. @ CAPS9 is absolutely terrifying. Then while that you test, there is someone who can sit still and their desk starts to shake. Well if anyone couldn't tell, one i am very impatient and two i hate the meap. @ CAPS2- @ CAPS1 is the most boring sound. With many others, I try to get a good score. @ CAPS2- @ CAPS1, small, sweat bundles, libom bom, eek, eek scribble- scribble.
Once I was patient was when my dad, @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ CAPS1 were going to @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, @ LOCATION1. Me, @ ORGANIZATION1 and my dad wanted to ride the Millennium Force. So we stood in line for two hours in the scorching sun while waiting to take the tour. Some of the difficulties were that the ride had problems. So when we finally got to the ride it was okay.
On @ DATE1, I was with my dad at @ NUM1 am. I was sitting there watching hoping something would come and all of a sudden I tried and fell asleep for an hour. When I woke up I was watching but nothing came for an hour as I waited and waited and waited. Then many nights I heard leaves crackle and thought it was really true. The first day I pulled one, saw one. I was a little too excited! I grabbed my gun too quickly and he ran away. Another day when we went out I saw another dead person but to my left this time. But I got my gun even slower this time and @ CAPS1 aimed and fired ! Well that's what I thought, but no it was stuck and @ CAPS1 had to unload it. Then my dad called me over the walkie talkie and asked me ' what are you doing ? " @ CAPS1 I said" I see a doe ", @ CAPS1 he said" then shoot ", & he stayed there @ CAPS1 I shot again and then he ran away," I got missed "I said all this patience for nothing.
I entered the large open room. The smell of pencil, animal crackers and dirt invaded the air and hit my nose like a big wave coming from the sea. I take my first nervous steps into the room. The floor is covered with toys and lots of pencils. Kindergartens are running around screaming like little animals hearing they were about to be eaten for dinner. The professor is in the middle of it all. She has a distant look in her eyes and it looks like she is about to cry. When she sees me and my name is marked, her face lights up a bit. She practically runs towards me with open arms. The teacher introduces herself and then says that they are all mine. I never would have realized that teaching students would have made me do so much teaching. I knew I would do some, but when the teacher introduced herself she said she was leaving and I had to teach them the alphabet. So I was stuck with @ NUM1 kids and a "war". I finally, grabbing and pulling, asked the kids to sit with applesauce crisscrossed on the floor. It's a shame I underestimated how wild they were. As I start one of the kids starts throwing toys at me, so as calmly as possible I half groaned, ”@ CAPS1 @ PERSON1, that's not nice, please stop. @ CAPS2 stops for about @ NUM2 seconds which are far too short. So it repeats itself and I end up doing it with all the dwarves with wild eyes and crazy hair. It took a lot of patience for them to finally stay still. We got to about @ CAPS3 when the guys got tough again. At that point, I felt more like a babysitter than a teacher. I gradually understood how this teacher was ready to go. Finally I get this light bulb going out in my head thinking I'm running to my purse, grab my bag of candy and say, " when we're done learning the alphabet A- @ CAPS4, anyone can saying everything will get a candy!: ”I realized for them that it is like gold for an adult. I was amazed and couldn't believe my ears. Every kid learned A- @ CAPS4, I actually ran out of candy even though it took a lot of patience and unnecessary bickering. When the bell rings, I rush off to go home. It took a lot of patience but I did it and I rewarded myself. I was sleeping!
One day I was patient, one day I was really happy that my birthday was approaching. I couldn't wait to see @ CAPS1 that I received. I thought about it for about a week begging my mom to tell me @ CAPS1 that I had. The days went by and it was as if they were getting longer and longer. I tried and tried day and day trying to take a spike at @ CAPS1 that I was getting, but still got caught. So finally my mother told me to stop thinking about it and be patient and it would be named sooner. So I waited, it seemed like it was taking forever. The next day I woke up my brother came over and jumped on me and said " ah-ah I know @ CAPS1 you get and you don't. " And I jumped up and said @ CAPS1 ! How come you know that and I don't? "This is bad please tell me" And he said no "then I got up and I walked out of the room and I went to my mom and I said" I'm giving up " she looked and said just be patient and it will go faster you only have four days left. " then i was gone. Then the days started to go faster and then my birthday came up i was so glad to finally see @ CAPS1 that I was getting. And that was the day that I was patient.
A time when I am patient. It's when I want something really bad. Like a phone or to access the computer or something. But that's not the only way to @ CAPS1 patient, you also have @ CAPS1 patient at church and doctor's office, so there are many ways to @ CAPS1 patient
I was patient when I had to wait in a really long line at the leader @ CAPS1 theme park ! At @ LOCATION1 I had to wait @ NUM1 hours for the ride, The @ CAPS2. It went from @ CAPS3 to @ NUM2 in @ CAPS4 ! On our way to @ NUM2 the hill climbed then stopped at the top (@ NUM4 yard) we just sat for like @ NUM5 sec! Then it moved and we went down to @ NUM6, that was really cool! It was worth the wait. It was then that I was patient!
It takes a lot of patients especially when you travel @ NUM1 strait hours. When I was @ NUM2 we went to @ LOCATION3 for six months. Me my mom and dad left @ NUM3 am for the airport. We waited a long time for it. When we finally got on the plane, we took the one hour flight to @ LOCATION4. Ten by @ NUM4 hours of flight to los @ LOCATION1. We have waited a long time at these airports. Then came the @ NUM5 hour flights to @ LOCATION2. It was the longest flight I have ever taken. The plane was a huge double-deck jet @ NUM6. Then we took the @ NUM7 hour flight to Hawk Bay. It was a very long journey. It took a ton of patients. Well we went because my dad was doing some rough golf. It also takes a lot of patients, but it's a lot more fun. He was the most patient I ever had to be.
Last year I went to the town of @ LOCATION1 with @ CAPS1 mom, @ CAPS1 stepfather, @ NUM1 from @ CAPS1 brothers, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS1 his @ NUM2 children @ PERSON1 and his bag . The first place we went was his state of freedom. We boarded live for the ferry which takes you to the island where the Statue of Liberty is located. We stood in line for the ferry that takes you to the island where the Statue of Liberty is located. The line was antique cuddly. I thought, “@ CAPS4 awesome” because it was perfectly @ DATE1 out there and we were going to be waiting here for at least an hour. After about half an hour, I noticed that the live was entering a building. What was in there? I was wondering. All the kids except us were complaining and @ CAPS1's parents were starting to get on their nerves, we finally walked into the building and guess what, another gigantic line ! Yov what a pleasure! At least the building was air conditioned. We had to go through metal detectors and stuff before we got on the ferry. The ferry ride was not bad but it was quite full. On the good side, we had to sit down. We all got off the ferry and looked up at Lady Liberty. It was actually really digging, unfortunately they closed the part where you could go inside because it was so hot. @ CAPS4 well, that was pretty cool to see it. We toured the entire island and were trying to find the ferry. We found the ferry and waited in the live @ CAPS5 until we got on the boat. I was proud of myself for not complaining. Apparently @ CAPS1 mom was because when we got back to the hotel she took me a side and thanked us for being so patient
Patience is like waiting your turn to speak or waiting for something to charge, patience can be helpful in many ways, like waiting until you get to your destination or waiting for the person you called to answer the phone to answer your questions. so you can talk. Patience can cause you to experience difficulties without complaining.
A story of patience A child wakes up. He goes upstairs for a drink. He comes back downstairs and watches cartoons. He gets very excited. When he remembers, he's going to a soccer game today. @ CAPS2 play @ CAPS1. His father comes down the stairs and tells him to get ready for the game. They drive about @ NUM1 miles to stadium @ CAPS2. They get there and find their places. The game starts. The kickoff of @ CAPS2. The @ CAPS2 stop them and at the end of the first half, the @ CAPS2 are down. ??? the score was from @ DATE1 to @ NUM2. You can already see people leaving. Next comes the @ DATE1. Now at the end of @ NUM3. the @ CAPS2 are down ??? More and more people are leaving. The @ CAPS2 are coming back. We are always here. Now down by @ NUM4 the @ CAPS2 gets another key ?? They are only down to three. @ NUM5 seconds ??? give @ PERSON1 culler throws a ??? go to @ LOCATION1 ?? her. the crowd goes wild. We were patient enough to stay until the end of the game.
This story is about when I broke my ankle. It happened about @ NUM1 years ago. I was in swim training and about to dive out of the lane @ NUM2. When I lost my balance while getting on the boulder I realized I was about to fall and tried to catch up, but ended up falling into the water and getting stuck. twisted back from swimming black. I had a lot of trouble getting out of the water. My mom called the doctor and found out I couldn't have ??? for almost ??? days. So she picked me up from the pool and brought her some old ??? those @ NUM3 days in my bed @ NUM4 when I found out my ankle was broken. So I ended up spending @ NUM5 weeks not training to swim, I was so bored. This was the time when I had to be patient for four days until I got an x-ray.
Ok, that was when I was on a bus going to Texas. My mother and my family would go to see my great-grandfather. The bus smelled nice but the same lady was still spraying perfume so I just had to sleep and have a few snacks. I kept getting woken up by a baby. Whenever I want to go to the bathroom, there was always someone in the bathroom. Also, when I tried to sleep, everyone seemed to get stronger. So when it was time to catch some @ CAPS1 '@ CAPS2, my bus driver would wake us up and we had to get off the bus for another bus. It seemed like never on this bus. You must have had a lot of patients or you wouldn't be able to relax after the day was over. I finally got there in @ NUM1 days. It was worth it as we went to six beaches. If I hadn't had patience, the experience of being on a bus for @ NUM1 days would have been a horrible experience.
Once I had to be patient, it was when I was friends with the same one I wanted for a long time. As soon as I got here I loaded the computer to see that it was still available. "@ CAPS1." I'm sad to try, it was still there. It had taken me a long time to sort it out. As I was thinking quickly about the command, I was like "@ CAPS2 will be too once I get @ CAPS2". @ CAPS3 I pressed the conforming command but @ CAPS3 and. they had also and now for the difficult part the wait. I went to school the next day and the next, and for a week @ CAPS2 continued until I wondered how smut it would be to finally get @ CAPS2. I took the long bus ride home. @ CAPS3 left waiting for when he would come. I rushed to the mailbox to collect the mail and found a box. My heart was hoping and beating faster @ CAPS3 I ran inside and protected it and there was my new @ CAPS4, I was so, so happy and all "my patience had paid off, I had had it.
There was this day not so long ago that I had to wait. Nothing but to wait. It was during the basketball trials that we were looking to see if we were part of the team. I had to wait and wonder if I had succeeded. I said to myself… I wonder, I wonder if I pushed enough, I wonder if I messed up too much. @ CAPS1 I could think of the mistakes I had made so that day @ TIME1 I was sitting here waiting here for my name… I had my name! “@ PERSON1 number @ NUM1 essays please come and get your paper.” I got it, pulled it out, opened it and read. "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 you made the goled team." I jumped up and down. That day I had my patients, and there for. I made the team.
Two summers ago I went to @ LOCATION2 and @ LOCATION1. We had to drive @ NUM1 straight hours. Most of the time I sat in the back seat and listened to my @ NUM2 reader. @ CAPS1 was a very boring car ride. Along the way, I looked for license plates with different states on them. We were halfway there so we stopped at a Dunkin donuts, @ CAPS1 was at the start of @ TIME1, my sister and I had donuts and hot chocolate. Then we got to a whole bunch of little stalls where you had to show your passport to enter. And finally we were at @ LOCATION2. We stayed there @ NUM3 or @ NUM4 nights. Then we hit the road for @ NUM5 hours. to go to @ LOCATION1. When we got there, all the patience paid off. And this is a time when I was patient
This story is about a time when I was patient. I was about @ NUM1 years old. It was a wonderful day outside. The best part is, it was my birthday. All of a sudden I had a brainstorm. I was going to try to ride a bike without training wheels. So I ran inside as fast as my little feet let it go to @ CAPS9. I went @ CAPS1 through the front door and shouted "@ CAPS2, @ CAPS3 @ CAPS7 quickly, I have something to tell you." "@ CAPS4 is from a buddy," my @ CAPS2 shouted as she came down the stairs. "@ CAPS5 is @ CAPS3" I shouted. "@ CAPS6 is coming." "@ CAPS7 on honey, you owe @ CAPS4 somewhere your son wants us to be here, that must be important." "it's, it's, it's", "@ CAPS7 on mom, we can meet him outside." "@ CAPS8, we'll be outside" "ok" "@ CAPS7 let go." @ CAPS9 and my @ CAPS2 ran outside to wait for @ CAPS3 and that was a time when I was patient.
Do you have a mother who is bisy all the time. Otherwise I do. For some reason I like to travel with her everywhere. One day we went to a place whose name I have forgotten. I was so patient. Being patient is a bit difficult because you really don't have to do anything. @ CAPS1 took it as @ NUM1. I was happy when we left, but I wasn't saying things like, come on, hurry up, @ CAPS1 is taking too long, @ CAPS2 hungry, @ CAPS2 ready to go and things like that.
When I was patient I asked my mom to buy me a bike and had to wait about two weeks for a bike on my birthday. anything so I keep asking and asking and asking so I stopped asking for three days and then she took a fish from me and then it died. Four weeks later I asked for a turtle and she said yes she will, then I waited and waited for her to buy me one.
One time my sister and mom were pacifists, that was when I went shopping for sporting goods and wanted a new bag and adidas sandals and crazy socks it took me hours to choose socks . my sister didn't get anything because she didn't have any money. So finally I just picked the zebras then I had to find the adidas but I didn't find them so an hour later there was only one left with my height but this girl got them took it right away and took them. I looked at my mom and she had diapers like you can get, so I went to get a bag, they had a rose left so I grabbed it and went home.
I don't have much patience because this year I get a laptop every day I'm looking for one I can't get my iPod down, I keep telling my family I have everything ready for one but i have to wait. Waiting for a laptop wasn't the only thing I had to have patience with. Last year for @ CAPS1 I got an iPod favor but had to wait the day before @ CAPS1 because my family participated we bought it in black @ DATE1 so I watched youtube videos on iPod touch because I couldn't wait any longer. It's hard to have patience when you want something when you already have it.
A time of patience when it's all the time if you weren't patient you will run all the time. (I have here there). You will never have time for yourself and your family like I tell myself when I eat, “Slow down so you don't go anywhere”. If your food was about to go somewhere, you won't because you have to try to do it. Take your time learning to be patient, it's easy to take your time.
One day my mom, dad and sister were going to @ LOCATION1 to go to unversual, it's a place of attraction. My dad and I are walking he ask if I want to go on this roller coaster called the dragons duling @ CAPS1 I was not sure about that because it was my first time on a roller coaster so I say no but I don't never knew if i liked roller coasters so i said ok let's go @ CAPS2 while in line we waited @ NUM1 hour and @ NUM2 minutes during that time, I would just watch other people walking around were in there and I'm looking for the first time and the roller coaster was going @ NUM3 miles per hour from where I was looking, so there's always @ NUM4 people in front of us so @ CAPS2 like when we go and we have the impression that time passes slower and slower and slower so @ CAPS2 as finally our turn is ni @ NUM5 times more fanilly I group goes @ CAPS1 it's ours I take my sunglasses and my father takes his sunglasses sun and we sit in front of @ CAPS1 here he goes up the track and @ CAPS2 like ok it's fun so we go like @ NUM6 miles per hour i can't even scream we go so fast then we go upside down and twich and everything then ends @ CAPS2 like no no no i love roller coasters and this is the time i was patient.
One morning @ DATE1 when everyone in my family wakes up at @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 in the morning. Me, my brother and my sisters said to my mom " Can @ CAPS4 play @ CAPS1 and labtop ". @ CAPS2 said sure, but you have to wait for the other's turn "and @ CAPS4 said" ok ". @ CAPS3 the @ CAPS4 played it. Each person had an hour and a half to play both things . I let my brother and sister play first because I'm the oldest and have to wait patiently until it's my city. Well, until it's my turn, @ CAPS4 wood has to play the game on things, @ CAPS4 would do it until the end of the day. Or until tomoro was done. That would be until the next @ DATE2 or until @ CAPS4 could read it again. And that's what I say I do as being patience at home and respect for my brother and sisters.
There have been many times that I have been patient. There was a time when I was patient for a whole month. I was buying a new basketball video game, but it didn't come out until a month later. So I had to be patient. I couldn't wait for the game to come out. It seemed like it was taking forever. It was the day before the game was released and I wasted my money that I was going to use to get the game. So I had to save extra @ NUM1 dolllers to buy the game I wanted. I had to get two @ DATE1 jobs so it could help me earn the money I lost. So two weeks later I went to the game store so that I could buy the game. When I walked into the store the manager told me that there were no more copies of basketball games. . So I had to be patient for another whole week @ NUM2 weeks, and I'm getting very angry. So I waited @ NUM2 weeks for the game and finally got the game. I was so angry I had to be patient for that long but got what it was anger. So this is my story on patience.
At a time when I was patient, I was at my grandmother @ LOCATION1, my cousins and I had to wait for my grandmother comes home @ CAPS1 we can go to the beach. After about an hour of waiting my cousin and; started playing video games for entertainment @ CAPS1 time went by faster my grandma had probably worked @ NUM1 hours @ CAPS1 at 3pm I decided to watch a movie I had been patient the whole time movie, in the middle of the movie my grandma came home @ CAPS1, we all waited patiently for her to be ready for the beach. It was a time when I had been patient.
I remember a time when someone I know was patient with me. It was near the start of the @ NUM1 class. I signed up for a band that year, playing the trumpet. We played songs and tested everyone we played correctly. But during my tests, my <@ NUM2 </PERSON> orchestra teacher noticed something funny about my tests. I was playing the wrong notes. He told me that I needed a long private lesson if I was going to play my notes well. So one afternoon after school. I took the lesson. I started by playing my notes for him. He said they were wrong. Then <@ NUM2 </PERSON> broke down the notes for us one by one. He told me the correct way to play the notes. He made me play the notes over and over and together. When I messed up he showed me how to play them being ?? be patient with me. Then finally, I played every note. The lesson lasted about @ NUM4 minutes and he was patient throughout the process. Now I'm playing my notes correctly, it's for @ PERSON1's lesson and patience. Now I know if I need more lessons in the future I can count on <@ NUM2 </PERSON> patience to get out where there is ?? compulsory courses.
This year I tried for my school's @ NUM1 level volleyball team . There were so many girls trying that I was nervous as to which team I was going to join or even if I would make a team. So I worked my best and thought that I had experience of other teams that I was in before and I was now confident to be part of the team. After @ NUM2 of tests, they had regrouped us in the team A, @ CAPS1 or intermural, according to your level of competence. We received a letter that afternoon, and I joined the A team ! We then went straight to training and games. Win most matches and improve teamwork. Then a few days ago we played against college @ ORGANIZATION1. As a college in the north, we were obviously rivals and determined to beat them. For “ bragging rigts ” we joked, but most importantly because we really wanted to do our best. The first game was very close, but we won and I played about half the time, surviving, hitting and moving around the field. I felt very confident, in the second game too, although I didn't play as much as I would have liked. I still had fun! In volleyball game, you play @ CAPS2 games in a match. The top two from @ CAPS2 win the match. By then we had won both games, which we won, but we still had to play the third game. Even though we won the game, our coach wanted us to win all @ CAPS2 ! Pretend it's the winning point and play as hard as you can, she said. So, at the start of Game 3, I was on the bench with some of the other players. I waited until about halfway through the game and wondered when I would be in it. Time had passed and I was discouraged because I had not yet played. I asked the coach a few times whether or not I was going, but she was too busy watching and coaching. So I sat down, and pretty much I pointed before the game was over, she looked at me and said, "Can you do that?" I pulled straight away and replaced. , and hit it! I had made the winning point! In the end, I learned to trust my coach and to have patience, because it's usually for the best! But boy, I had a great time serving the winning point. It really taught me a lesson!
The word patience means a lot of things. It can mean waiting and something and more. It also speaks a lot ??? It takes time and effort. I '@ CAPS1 the kind who complains a lot and I have no patience. Other people don't complain, they do. Many teenagers have no patience. As you get older, you develop patience. Some adults don't have patience, it depends if you are working on it. It also depends on whether the person has been through life.
My mom is the most patient person I know. When she drops me off at practice, she waits two and a half hours for me to cheer, fly and dance the whole routine. When I go to science programs, she waits at least two hours until it's over. Every morning, she waits for me to finish getting ready. After school, she is waiting for me to buy something at the table in the hall. All she asks is that we return the favor. She doesn't rush us unless we're late. And she always hugs us before leaving.
Patient I was patient when I didn't want to become Wisconsic. I was patient on my way (by car). I was own when I was fishing, I'm not complaining now it's boring. I had no intention of sleeping on the floor @ CAPS1. The whole camping trip I was patient. The story begins. @ STATE1, took @ NUM1 hours. In the car, I had a TV that I carried for a while, then I looked outside and said a swing ! I shouted " moose !" The boyfriend in my room, Mike stopped and backed up and it was the first time I had seen a moose. Then when we got there, we pitched our tent and then we went fishing. I was patient for the peach to bite my wife. I was so patient that I got @ NUM2 fish that day. Then when we came back I had to sleep on the floor. There were bumps and rocks under me, but I didn't complain because that's how it's comping. The next day we were on our way home and couldn't find the TV and didn't have a drink. I had to go to the bathroom. A sign said, a station @ CAPS2 at the exit @ NUM3 ''. I was patient, I went to the bathroom and took some water.
One day there was a little boy named @ CAPS1. He was really hungry and his mom was a slow cooker. It would take him forever to finish cooking. @ CAPS1 was hungry and he was getting really little patient with his mother @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 went out to play with his friends. He came home and wished dinner was ready. He went into the kitchen and said "mom is ready to have dinner". “@ CAPS3 right now,” mom said. It won't be ready for an hour. @ CAPS1 thought about what he could do until dinner was ready @ CAPS4 he went to play his video game. It was a spaceship game. The spaceship was shooting other spaceships to survive. @ CAPS1 got bored @ CAPS4 he went to the kitchen to see if dinner was ready. Her mom wasn't done @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 was patient and her mom finished less than five minutes.
Patience is when you wait for something without complaining. Once I was patient was when I was @ NUM1 years old. It was around @ NUM2 that day, but the winds were picking up a bit. I was patient if I could take a tour of the adventures of @ LOCATION1. They were shimmering woods. The line was very and when I mean very, I mean long. It took me about half an hour to get on board. Another ride I was expecting was the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. But this one was shorter. It only took about @ NUM3 minutes. All of these rides need to be patient because if I wasn't patient I wouldn't be doing the right rides. The last is when I was @ NUM4. I wanted to ride the Thunder Hawk and the line lasted an hour. I played my nintendo like while i was waiting so he could be patient. An hour later I was able to make this trip because of the patience.
The patient is when you listen and tolerate what someone is feeling. My mom and dad are very patient @ CAPS1 me and my sister .my siter just came and moved @ CAPS1 us she ia @ num1 years old. She came @ CAPS2 to live @ CAPS1 us. It's hard @ CAPS1 a new person in the family you always @ CAPS2 get that extra thing like extra plate, pizza spoon , supplies and things she needs for school. Since we have @ CAPS2 grt stuff, we have @ CAPS2 working harder my sister doesn't do everything I used @ CAPS2 my parents are more patient and forgive her @ CAPS2 but I know why sometimes my mom and my dad cvantg and nasty but she would, i would be in trouble because she is older than me but not used @ CAPS2 the way we can do things at home. I am looking for @ CAPS2 my parents they are so nice @ CAPS2 everyone and even ??? it's different to know they're always patient.
I have no patience.
This is the story of a time when I had to be patient. It happens every year, I'm pretty sure everyone is aware of it. It's the anniversary of the call. Every year I have to wait @ NUM1 days for my birthday to come. It takes time, but I know I have to be patient. Being patient is hard work, but it usually pays off. Another way I have to be patient is to wait for the @ CAPS1 tests to complete. But I always remember that it has to end someday. So I have to sit there, do the work and be patient.
I played soccer for a recreation team called the Cheetahs. Rec means I was in the best division possible. Rec soccer was fun, but my two best friends and I did all the work, no one else on the team was doing anything. So I decided to go try for a small team. A select team is in the second highest division you can be in. When the practice came, I was really nervous. After trying for three days, if you were selected, you would receive a phone call saying that you had been on the team. It took a long time to get a phone call, it was like taking a country. Between those days I had to wait and wait and wait and wait and so on, when you wait for a long period of time, that's called patience.
I think patient is when someone is able to wait and not complain. I've never been patient, so here's a story I made up. One day there was a girl named @ CAPS1. She really wanted to go to the park. But she still had to do her homework, her chores, take care of her sister and tidy up the rest of the dinner. She was really busy. She started with her homework first because she had a math program ?? @ NUM1 problems on each side. What was easy because they were ?? addition and subtraction. It took him @ NUM2 minutes, (@ NUM3 on each side), which isn't that bad. Then she did the chores. Her chores consisted of cleaning her bedroom and living room because her sister played here everywhere before. But luckily her sister was asleep. Now that she's resting and not making a mess, @ CAPS2 took @ CAPS1 about @ NUM4 minutes to clean up everyday because all she had trouble doing was throwing them in the bar to toys. Now we go to his room. Allie messy room, you could not open the door first. So she had to pull on the door until she could finally fit in. The slamming of the door closed all the clothes but luckily did not wake her sister. @ CAPS1 first made a checklist of what she needed to do: vacuum, fix her bed, and put away all the food that was in her room in the kitchen. It took about @ NUM5 hour and a half. So in all, it's been about @ NUM5: 45 minutes. Now all she had to do was clean up the rest of the dinner. Her mom couldn't because she had to drop her dad off at the aerial part for work, so @ CAPS2 depended on her. But the bad thing is they had speghettl for dinner and her sister knocked the house over on the floor so she had to mop. So right away she cleaned the table which took @ NUM7 minutes, cleaned up which took about @ NUM4 minutes, when she finally finished her sister woke up and she had to feed her, then she was able to take him with her to the park. She gave him apples and when they were finally done she took her sister with her and they had a blast.
I have had to be patient many times in my life. Sometimes we have to be patient with doctors, pending further outflows games and movies. but I'm going to tell you about a time when I had to be patient in an airport. I once had to be patient in an airport. The problem was not to wait for the arrival of the plane or the queue for our ticket. We had to wait because all the planes were down. We must have slept there at night. I was as patient as I could get, but my grandma didn't like the fact that we had to wait over an hour just to get into the food court and then another hour just to get our food. It was very busy and it took all the patience not to get mad at all the other people. Some examples of how I felt about my patients are pictures of being at the doctor's, long trips in the car, or maybe even waiting for a test result and there are a lot of other things. Make sure you work on the patients and stay calm.
I think my trainer is patient because there are @ NUM1 girls she is watching. She has to teach us things that we don't know. Our trainer taught us tricks like the @ CAPS1 game and taught us to do moves like crossovers. She teaches us to run fast, she has to be patient with slower children who cannot run so fast. Our coach had to be patient when she handed out jerseys because we all had to try them on and that for a little while, so she had to be patient.
We don't all like to wait and wait, but we have to learn to be patient. @ DATE1 @ DATE1 @ DATE1 when i went to @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS1 i had to be patient for a lot of things. I had to be patient while waiting at the airport and using public transport. Being patient means being understanding and tolerant. During my trip, I had to wait a lot at airports. While always being patient. It was important to be very patient while waiting for your flight to be called. Another place to be patient was when I had to wait for my bag to come on the baggage carousel. Another long wait to be patient at the airport security. To sum up, you have. Be patient while waiting at airports. When I went to @ LOCATION1 @ DATE1 I had to be patient when using public transportation. While waiting for a train to arrive, it was rush hour and the train was full. When I was in the taxi and there was traffic outside. I relaxed and I was patient. To conclude, I had to be patient when using public transport. I still don't like to stand in line but I am patient when I do. I have learned patience in waiting and in being, but it is something that we have to do.
When my dad and I were in line for the Kencer Hauck at @ LOCATION1 adventures ! I had to wait patiently to go up. The queue was huge so many people ??? of us and it was shocking that so many ??? ??? in the queue for this roller coaster we waited for what seemed like hours being just minutes, and as we got closer it became difficult to be patient. Finally we got on the ride and it was on the ride and it was crazy so wait for those minutes that seemed like hours ??? awarded a ??? ???
I was at @ ORGANIZATION1 once through. We had already had our food and we were waiting for it to be able to eat. We waited about ten minutes. Then finally our food arrived! We looked at the food they gave us and we got all the bad food and no drink. So my mother had to give them everything back. We had to wait about fifteen minutes this time. So we waited and waited and waited. Eventually they gave us our food and this time we got the store we ordered. We finally left @ ORGANIZATION2 and were able to eat our food. We also had ice cream after eating. "@ CAPS1, the good thing is you've been so patient. Thanks guys for being good!" that's what my mom told us when we got home. this is how I was patience.
(pending) (treat beatina) "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. @ CAPS3 is your cords repolt". said @ PERSON2hemlock. I @ PERSON1 was last in line. "@ CAPS3 you go @ PERSON1 @ CAPS11 A '@ CAPS12, keep up the good work ! " said @ PERSON2. " @ CAPS4 !!!! " I said shouting with joy I ran home straight back A '@ CAPS12" "@ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 @ PERSON1 . " @ CAPS7 mom aya said. I called @ CAPS7 @ CAPS9 @ CAPS8 saying, “@ CAPS9. I @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11 A '@ CAPS12 ! but can I older something from the internet for @ MONEY1 ? » “ @ CAPS13 why not for a student @ CAPS11 A '@ CAPS12. I placed the order @ CAPS7 and waited @ NUM1 week… ???
A time when I was patient was when I went to a skate compition in @ CAPS1 the entry line was almost by @ CAPS2 I stayed there for almost an hour but when I got there and paid my fees, it was worth it because I am competing with my best friends.
A patient time was at the I was waiting where I birthday party @ NUM1 live online and the line was like a mile long so I waited and waited and then finally I go get my ticket and forget I left in the car so had to walk all the way back. So I come back which has become twice as big as before then I wait again it was bad then it starts to rain, I don't have an umbrella, I'm still waiting. How could it be worse? Way above, they stopped the concert. So I went home soaked, hands and feet. So I'm just going to sleep and relax. PS worst day of my life.
I have very little patience. I mean almost none. When I wait, I have this strange feeling, almost like a toothache. Weird eh? Well you see the picture, let me tell you a story about when I lost my patience. It was @ DATE1, I was at my @ CAPS1 safety course hosted by @ ORGANIZATION1. We had just completed the test that determined the success or failure of the course. They came out with the first group of names of successful people and their certificates. By the way, everyone's outside watching. The first group was done at NUM1 minutes. It took about @ NUM2 minutes to score the tests and five to hand out the awards. Unfortunately my group was last. We all sat on a bench for three hours! My patience was completely exhausted, I just started rocking back and forth @ CAPS2 my group was finally called and we got our prizes ! Fortunately, my patience has improved a @ CAPS3 from @ CAPS2. I passed the course and am becoming a voucher @ CAPS1. I slaughtered a partridge and a dollar @ NUM3 points. This is my story, good night!
I have to be patient when I take the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. I am patient because I have to wait for my classmates to finish their @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. Sometimes I have to wait forever. But it's fine, I can just take a nap. I hate being patient sometimes. like @ NUM1 minutes just for people to finish a test. This is good because you shouldn't rush to @ CAPS1. It just frustrates me that people take so long. It's not only at school, it's also at home. The doctor, the dentists with friends and at the library. Man, it's so hard to be patient. But it's not good to be patient. I wish people were as fast as me during a test. So I wouldn't have to be very patient. gonna face it man it really stinks to be so patient.
Patience is a good thing to have. Good things come from patience and bad things don't. But what is patience? Patience is being able to deal with problems without complaining and without complaining about them. Patience is being able to wait when others cannot. Some people are very impatient, like my dad at times. For about a month he had saved his extra money for a new @ CAPS1. Once he had had enough he got a new flat screen "@ NUM1" @ CAPS1, but if he had only waited one more week he could have gotten one of about a foot. bigger for the same price. Let's say your little sister puts you in a sack and you gently beep to ask her to stop, but she just won't do it. So instead of completely turning on her which will cause you tons of trouble, just wait for a parent to come home for her to get into trouble and you don't.
Once upon a time there was a girl named @ PERSON2. She had always dreamed of being a princess. Every gift she received was either a dress or jewelry. She loved to try on dresses. She had two sisters @ NUM1 (one year older than @ PERSON2) and were called @ CAPS1 and @ PERSON1. The house @ CAPS3 is an old house located in the woods. One day @ PERSON2 went out to get the mail and a man in a tuxedo gave her a letter that looked very fancy. @ PERSON2 opened the letter and read it aloud, it said "@ CAPS2 @ PERSON2, you are invited to a ball at the castle on @ DATE1 at @ NUM2 pm." @ PERSON2 shouted with joy. @ PERSON2 decided to go to the mall to get a ball gown. She found a nice dress, but it was too much money. She asked the lady at the front desk if there was any way to lower the price if she helped in the store for a few days. She accepted the offer. She worked and worked for hours for two days. And frankly, his patients have paid. She could take the dress home. She went home and put on the dress. She only had an hour so she had to hurry. She put on her makeup and jewelry and looked at herself in the mirror and said I had. She got in the car and drove to the castle, it was so beautiful the way the moon hit the golden paint. @ PERSON2 got out of the car and entered the castle. She walked down the stairs and everyone looked at her. It was @ CAPS3 the best day of her life for everyone to think she was beautiful. She went on the dance floor and danced with some guys. The prince came to introduce himself and when she turned around he fell in love. @ PERSON2 couldn't believe the prince had spoken to him. He asked her to dance. They danced the night away. When the prince took the stage, he called her name and she took the stage. He asked her if you would marry me, she said yes. She had become a princess! Sometimes dreams really do come true.
Once I had to be patient, I had to babysit. My family friend has a one year old @ CAPS1, and I have a six year old brother. I had to keep them both because my mom and her boyfriend were going to have a double date with our family friends. Things were going well until they left. My brother was in kindergarten at the time @ CAPS2 they gave them these paper books and worksheets to do and I had to help him. @ CAPS2 I thought ok this will be easy, I had @ CAPS2 I had read the book and my mother told me he knows the words @ CAPS2 I am not going to have to probe all one, so that he didn't do the job and the baby kept crying and the dog kept barking (he hates when babies cry) and the house was crazy ! @ CAPS2 I started to panic. What was I supposed to do? And I didn't know what to ruin my mom's plans and I really wanted to prove her wrong. @ CAPS2 I calmed down and remembered what a friend of ours said he told me to be patient. @ CAPS2 I left the dog outside, picked up the baby and returned to the table where my brother was playing. First I read the book out loud it both got their attention. Then I said Andi made a game to do the job and it was good. Then @ CAPS4 time came @ CAPS2 I made it one little food we all liked and put the baby in his high chair with his food and I gave my brother his plate, I turned around and he threw his plate at me and the food was all over the place! I got mad and told myself to be patient I cleaned up the mess and fed the kids and put on a movie and they all feel asleep! I quietly cleaned the house and my mom and friends walked in and were surprised they did. Patience is an important part in life if you lose your temper it only makes things worse.
One day my mother came home from work. She walked in and said "@ CAPS1, do you want to go shopping for your clothes @ CAPS2 or later?" I chose @ CAPS2. So my mom changed her clothes and we went to the store. It was around @ NUM1 so it was rush hour. It seemed like it was taking forever and I was going crazy. Then my mom told me to be patient and it will be over soon. It was a time when I was patient. After ten minutes things started to clear up. It still took a while but it was improving. In less than twenty minutes, we pulled up to the @ LOCATION1 parking lot. There were a few cars in the parking lot but that didn't seem like a lot. When we entered the store, I was really angry. The queues for you to buy your items lead to the back of the store. Then my mom said, “@ CAPS2 look. The lines are long as you can see. Are you sure you can handle this and have patients ? ” “I 'll try.” I said. After entering the store, we were looking for my clothes, we also looked at the long queues, to see if they got off . We got my clothes back, then we stood in line. We spent about an hour in the queue. and it made me mad. Not only that made me crazy, but it made me want to eat because I skipped lunch. When we came out of the store, we were happy and hungry. We left the store and went to @ CAPS3.Donalds. When we were down the street from @ ORGANIZATION1 there was this traphic line that we were getting closer to @ ORGANIZATION1 and then we realized that this line was the @ ORGANIZATION1 line . We entered the lot and I knew for sure I was going to have more patients. No So we waited and the queue went very quickly. We approached the spoorker and my mom ordered a fish sandwich for her and a chicken sandwich for me. We got to the next window and they gave us our food. When we got our food the lady said "@ CAPS4 you for your patients". Then she asked us if we would like a free fry of any size for our wait. We told him yes and we're going to have a big fries. My mom turned to me and said, “ Do you see what happens if you are patient ? " I said yes and patients are a good thing to have. It was a time when I was patient.
The time I was patient I had problems with football. I needed help doing everything. But my father helped me. He taught me to kick, run and kaney. I was patient because I watched them I did. I saw a helping my dad play, we went out to join them. The things he tated to me were hard, but he helped.
Patience is probably one of the most important things in your life. If you are patient most people will probably like you more, for example if you queue for something at school and have been patient you will probably get an "@ CAPS1 you" from one of your teachers for being so patient. Always be patient, weather or not if it's at school, a queue in a fun park in front, and behind a bunch of people, you'll want to be patient, because if you're not, you wouldn't want to lose it in front of all these people and cut in front of them, and maybe be thrown out of the ammusmend park in front of all these people, then you would be embarrassed. This is why I think patience is important.
Fishing is a great sport, but it takes a lot of patience. My first fishing trip was to a lake about @ NUM1 miles from my home. I had loved fishing since then, but the trip was not easy. I think fishing is fun because I was patient to accomplish what I did, it took all the patience I had. When my uncle comes from @ LOCATION1 he always brings his rods and fish differently. I never went with him until about a year ago. He decided I had to bring a friend. So if I'm bothered, I'd like to talk to someone. Patience started when we were halfway there and @ CAPS1! We hit a fence. The car broke down so we called a ground break. The wait was around @ NUM2 hours, @ NUM3 min and my friend asked. And my friend sucked. We finally fixed the car and drove the rest of the way. When we got there we had two issues to solve and we had no bait. We found a beautiful place on the other side of the lake. We had to get revenge on some bait, which took about @ NUM4 hours to get enough bait. We were finally ready to fish. We got the canes, sat the chairs, threw in and waited. There was no way to speed up the fishing so we sat down hoping for a few bites. Eventually my uncle, my friend and I caught @ NUM5 fish ! We had eaten three for lunch and came home with @ NUM6 leftover fish. I like to go fishing because it relaxes me. I felt like anything could have happened, but we went fishing, relaxed and had a few meals. This is why I am fishing because it requires patience.
Once when I was patient it was my birthday I was shooting @ NUM1. I was very excited because I knew I was going to have a cell phone and that's all I wanted. All of my friends had them, I just wanted one because if my mom had to come and get me for something and didn't know where I was. It is just a need at the moment because they are very useful. My birthday was a @ DATE1, so the day before I football game, everyone asked me if I was going to have me and I could not stop them say yes, I'll have it tomorrow. I woke up the next morning and ran downstairs. The first gift I got was the cell phone and I was really happy and started to get all the numbers from my friends. I learned when your patient and does not ask you to get what you want.
One day my brother and I asked my dad to ask us to stop the game so that we have a cold game controller he was sad a little bit but so we passed by rolling four and then we went swim to win so he still wasn't ready so we play with my dog macy and then he was finally ready to go so we went to the game stop to take control and they didn't harass him so we went to @ CAPS1 boster and they had it so we got the controller and they didn't have it so we went back to @ CAPS1 boster and they had it so we got the controller and went home and put the game there and that's how I spent the whole day. And the best we can be is to keep your trust in yourself for the long haul.
My grandma was a patient for @ NUM1 months because she had a big check that kept mastakes like her last name was misspelled so had to call it back and re-enter it every time they retyped it, they would mastake five times in a row and it takes a long time for the pross and we had to pay for our pills so we didn't get fired. We also needed a new car and clothes. Our car is about to break down and our clothes are pushing us out. When my grandmother finally got her check, we went straight ahead and bought a brand new car. and clothes. I think my grandmother was patient enough after having to do it over five times, I know she couldn't be so patient without losing her .
The story is about a time when I was patient. I am patient. I am patient before I wait @ CAPS1. I am not a person who ??? be patient. When I want something, I was that second. Christmas is my favorite holiday. There are so many good things about it. There are cokkies, family and present. There is still a problem and my problem is that I like to try to figure out what my present is. This is what stinks of being patient, you are always waiting for something good to happen. My whole family know that nothing should be bagged for me because I will search the bag easily and if they don't wrap it very well I will find a little slit in the wrapping paper. The worst time to be patient is the day before you open your gifts. I really hate that you have to go to bed and your presents are screaming don't leave them unpacked. Something too, it seems like all vacations are like this. Well I guess we all have to be patient on something. I'm patient on @ LOCATION1 football winning the @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 and @ ORGANIZATION1 and the flordia gators. Ficst @ ORGANIZATION1 must come out of the daring game @ CAPS5.
Subject : write a story your own way about patience @ CAPS1 have you ever seen someone @ CAPS1 good patience ? well I @ CAPS1. @ The neighbor CAPS5 just couldn't wait for the football tryouts for the score. He practiced juggling and moving all day. The day has come and for the tests. He went to juggle, spoke with the coach, shaved a few moves and went home. "It will take a few weeks to see if you are on the team or not Coach @ CAPS3" @ CAPS2 ", @ CAPS3 @ CAPS5," I can't wait that long ". After his return, he told me everything. I @ CAPS1 to wait a few weeks, ”he @ CAPS3. So I spoke to him about patience. The more you complain, I @ CAPS3, the worse you will be disappointed. So he went home and practiced a move he couldn't do. A few days later. I was going out when all of a sudden, "@ CAPS4" A friend from @ CAPS5 came out yelling out saying "I did it" just smiled while I @ CAPS3 "patience, patience works".
Once I was patient, I was @ NUM1 when I caught my @ NUM2 fish. My dad and I went fishing on my uncles, my dad stopped the fight where we were going to fish, my dad helped me put on my backbone of life, then he beat my pocil. And then break it for me my dad was catching them like crazy like the @ NUM2 @ NUM4 he got about @ NUM5 fish he told me to be "patient" it was my time @ NUM2 as my dad was pulling them in I POSITIONED there waiting then all of a sudden my Bobes was coming down I shouted at my dad said - he realizes in I Tride and TRIDE and almost felt from the fight that my dad came and m 'helped when we got to the fight that I asked my dad what kind of fish it was he said it was a blue gill he said it was a good catch for a first time so my dad and I enjoyed it and went back to fishing. It was a time when I had to be patient.
Write about a time when I was patient. In my old school before this school I was patient with all the @ NUM1 in some @ NUM2 jump people in I told them they didn't want to fight anymore so I hold my patients in the teachers they were talking about in I saw them outside they didn't do anything to me, so how not, they were fighting to make the school happy.
Patience, everyone knows what it is and how we can all stay focused, it's like waiting in front of a line of unemployed, we wait because the patient keeps us from getting angry, but if we wait a long time, we have a better chance of getting angry. When you wait you also show that you know someone in front of you and that you are waiting wait for it to be your turn because waiting and being patient allows you to absorb the things around you and look at things that you don't. have never seen in your whole life and stay what you have seen to see what it is even if you already know it when your patience you show gradation to the person in front of you and graduation shows respect and trust is a way of being polite and patient with the person in front of you. When you are patient you don't have to rush anything because you have plenty of time and you shouldn't complain at all when you are or try to be patient no matter how long your patient is the maximum time for you and you make that time go by faster by not being patient and patient is a great thing because the patient gives you what you want or what you need in a lot of time I think patience is important because you don't never know who the patient is for you, so you should be patient with someone else
The first time I was patient before was when I had to wait @ DATE1 years to get the @ DATE1 film out of my camera. My mom always promises me to get the movie, but I feel like her money was used ??? She told me to wait @ DATE1 @ DATE1. So I waited until @ DATE1 @ DATE1 had risen and that's what happened, I ask my mom again if I can get my film out of my camera. She said no because she used her money ??? school supplies. I happened to wait for another @ DATE1 @ DATE1 so @ DATE1 @ DATE1 came back. I asked her and she said no because once again she spent her money without repaying people from them to help her like any father. So I had to wait for the next @ NUM1 @ DATE1 so I waited, and waited, and finally @ NUM1 @ DATE1 has passed and she forgets so she had to do the grocery shopping. So @ DATE1 I ask her again and she says. Yeah, but she had to reimburse my dad for helping her and after that she said after school i ??? take out my film to buy it. So how now did you say how ??? I waited to do this and also had to get a new digital camera as it was dropped several times.
Every day at launch, I have to be patient while waiting to be called for my lunch. Especially when you are in line, you have to be really patient. But sometimes you get lucky and you can switch to the other line to pay for lunch. And then when you're done having lunch, you can go out and play. But @ CAPS1 you have to finish your food and throw it away and wait patiently. And it was a time when I was patient.
I was patient on an airplane flight for @ LOCATION1. All I did was watch the towers and buildings as I took them out. I was also patient when my little brother. Many got hit and had to wait in the lobby. The biggest time I was patient was with my brother and him going through my patient, breaking all my things, biting me with his toys and his constant whining or crying over the things he wanted.
During @ DATE1 my family and I went to @ LOCATION3 for a few weeks. At the start of the second week I did something that I had never done before. My two older sisters (@ LOCATION1 and @ PERSON1), my father, cousin (@ PERSON2), @ PERSON2's uncle (@ CAPS1) and I were on our way to the boat. I was excited, it was my first time fishing in an ocean. A few hours ago and we haven't caught anything, but we still waited drinking coffee, telling jokes, playing little pranks like shooting each other to make them think we grabbed something. thing. We left at @ NUM1 am and now it was @ NUM2 pm. We still haven't caught anything, but daddy and @ CAPS1 go fishing all the time and said we just have to be patient. About @ NUM3 minutes later the @ CAPS3 line started pulling @ CAPS1 helping it reach it, it was a clam the size of my thumb. Everyone was so patient but no one caught anything else. It was now @ NUM4 pm and we decided to go home. @ PERSON2 was happy. Everyone was just patient and waiting to catch something, but @ PERSON2 was also very patient as she had to use the washroom most of the time we were on the boat. I think most of us on the boat must have secretly used the bathroom after being there for so many hours. When we got home we told everyone what we had caught which was nothing to everyone except @ PERSON3 and his little clam. I know a lot of people who wouldn't last an hour on this boat. So I was proud of everyone's patience and hope to do it again the next time I go to @ LOCATION2 with my family.
Being patient is not an easy thing to maintain. It takes self-control to have patience. Having patience is very important because if you have a gon ??? and your non-patient maugio is waiting for your turn here is not going to hire you, here is not looking for an impatient person. First of all my family and I were going on a trip to @ LOCATION1 but we had to go at @ DATE1 am so I couldn't fall asleep. I woke up to @ TIME1am so I was tired. I couldn't take a nap because if I did, the nap would turn into deep sleep. Then I and to finish packing ?????????? so i was really tired and ?????????? show that I was executed because there was an hour left. When I'm done packing. I started watching TV to keep myself awake because I can't fall asleep under a ????????. Then my cousin had to change his diaper so I had to change it, but @ CAPS1 when I was @ CAPS1 about to have ???????????????????? called and said "let's go." I was happy because now I can go to sleep in the rental van. In conclusion, I had to maintain my patience, but it was really hard to do when you were really sleepy. I tried different things to keep me awake and it worked. What was really about to anger me was that I had to change a ladle, but sometimes I maintained my patience.
One fine day in her I got up, my sister and I were outside @ CAPS1. My mom said the shed was large . She goes to the store a few hours late, she is not cooked with a hot one. She said @ CAPS2 was for my sister, but she said she did could not open @ CAPS2 before his birthday. Her birthday was in a few weeks. She said she couldn't wait that long and walked away. After a few days, she decided to be patient. She thought the days would pass by department. They did it to his staff, but not fast enough. My mom to me waiting to just target her body on the boy. @ CAPS2 is difficult for her to go to her house, isn't she ??? I was going ???. I have decided ?? ? We came the cream and said a way home. Finally @ CAPS2 was her birthday and she was a yoke boy. She had opened all of her daughters except one. The hot was sitting I want her. She dosed and tore @ CAPS2. One When she opened @ CAPS2. She just watched. In the pause of silence, she said. "@ CAPS2 are only clothes". I could tell she didn't like @ CAPS2. "I can't believe I've waited so long for clothes." I laughed. I thought @ CAPS2 was bananas. After you stopped laughing because I was told not to get used to the patient house, you might never be again.
Have you ever been in a situation where you know something good is happening or is going to happen and you just can't control yourself @ CAPS1 ? You ask your parents " when " and they say : " soon a little patience !" " Well, it happened to me several times, as when we went to @ or @ LOCATION1 LOCATION2, but on this special occasion, get our new dog. I decided to be a mature teenager and to be patient. It was @ DATE1 @ TIME1, the day my family was going to have a dog and I was so excited. My stomach was full of butterflies, trying to fly away and explode with happiness. Everyone in my family was the same, but at that point I remembered my goal of being a mature teenager and a patient. So I continued with my normal everyday life. Eat breakfast, paint, dress, brush your teeth and go to school. Later when I got home my mom announced that my dad would be arriving with my puppy in @ NUM1 minutes. So I sat in my chair in my room and watched the clock ticking for about @ NUM2 minutes. Then I walked into the living room, where the rest of my family were sitting, and waited until I heard a door slam. Suddenly. Boom! The door slammed on my father's truck. My mom, brother and sister rushed out the door as I walked just to see the puppy. “ Aouh ! " Everyone shouted. “@ CAPS1 I have her”, and “this is my dog” and “let's call her” also entered the conversation. Then my dad looked at me, standing quietly and handled me the dog. "you are so patient you @ CAPS1 be the first to hold it!" I was so proud of myself. I was patient and I was the one to hold it first. Being patient @ CAPS1 pays off !
I was patient when I was at my friend's house in the winter shoveling a sled slot so we could but sprinkle on it to make ice. When we shoveled it became difficult, we had to go through a lot of snow just to get to a nice layer of snow to get a lot of water in. I'm not gye patient when. We do something for hours to do it completely. But I kept telling myself to be patient. The only reason I was losing my patients was that it was getting dark and I have to go soon. But before I lost our patience we did it and I was so happy we finished the icy trail. It was hard because you also had to wait for the water to turn to ice but that didn't bother me at all. This is how I was patient that day to do something great and fun. But… I couldn't or we couldn't continue that night because it was too late. I am my story on patientce Le @ CAPS1
Patience is an important part of life and I have learned that @ DATE1 during the hunting season. Most of @ DATE1 we sat down and saw everything except deer. We were getting to the point where we didn't want to go anymore but we did it anyway. As the days went by, as it got colder, we started to see a few. My step dad @ PERSON1 said we would get one on @ DATE2 if we don't see the money. After a few days it was @ DATE2 and we were going to shoot a doe but we didn't see anything from @ DATE2 most of the time. When there were about @ NUM1 light minutes @ DATE2 left, the perfect dollar entered the field.
One day my mother and my brother were driving our car. We were going to a beach when suddenly our car was no longer moving. The battery was dead and not working. My mom called a tow truck and said he wouldn't be there for two hours! My brother and I complained all the time, but my mom was silent, so the truck (@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3) came up to us. I was amazed at my mother's patience.
Once I was going to the bus stop, and I had had their @ NUM1 minutes before the bus arrived, so I sat down and looked at my watch, it was @ NUM2 minutes after the time I was in charge to be picked up so I waited and waited so I looked at my watch again it was at NUM3 minutes past the time I was helping to get in the bus. So I was growing up in a nation but I thought the buses are okay ??? I sat down and wanted because I was going ???? and i got very patient and after @ NUM4 more minutes the bus had arrived, and it let me free because i was the only person standing ? So when I got home my mom asked me how it went in gow. I said the bus was NUM5 minutes late. She said what did you do. I said I had waited and they let me go. .
I was waiting in line at @ LOCATION1 adventure for a ride. I was getting impatient just while waiting for them. But suddenly I saw the line move. So I calmed down and waited, when it was our turn to ride. I just understood that we had been waiting for an hour. Understanding patience means that you know why you have to put up with their waiting. Because you can't make your way to the first row. Tolerance means that you can't do or get what you don't want unless you do it wrong. You can't hit, cut, push or move to the front of the line, you just have to wait.
Being patient takes a lot of tolerance. For most people @ CAPS6 is difficult to be patient, but sometimes @ CAPS6 is very important. A few weeks ago, my neighbor really needed a break with her @ NUM1 year old daughter @ CAPS1. I gladly offered to babysit because I love being with her. I certainly didn't know @ CAPS2 who I was for. She came around noon and we played for hours. But then she got cranky. I gave him a snack but it didn't help. She started to cry so hard that I have no idea what @ CAPS2 to do. My mother rushed into the room in panic mode. "@ CAPS2 going? Everything is fine here," she asked. I told him everything was fine, but @ CAPS1 is really cranky. My mother replied "let's take her to the park, she will have fun there!" I accepted and we left. If you notice it, @ CAPS1 likes to do things on her own. She insisted on sitting in her car seat, getting on the swings, and putting together puzzles. It takes a ton of patience because it takes forever. I love watching @ CAPS1 but if I didn't have a patient @ CAPS6 would be extremely difficult.
It takes patience when you are on the hunt. After about @ NUM1 deer seasons my patience died out. I was using a bow and ran @ NUM2 dot came out. He was about @ NUM3 yards from my booth and I called him closer. Then he was @ NUM4 yards from my booth. I took the hit and he gave in and the @ NUM5 minutes I waited to find him felt like a living. Then I got out of my booth, he ran about @ NUM6 yards and fell. When I got to him. I was so excited because he hadn't won @ NUM2 point he was @ NUM8 point back. Remember to use Regin's blood head and be patient, you could shoot the stag of a lifetime.
It's a story of patience. Patience is necessary in life. Sometimes when you are very frustrated you need patience. One of the reasons is that if someone or something makes you angry, you need patience or you may be in trouble. For example, if you get mad at someone and start a fight, you will be in big trouble. Or if you try to do something and you can't do it, you need patience or you may break something and be in trouble. Another reason for patience is if you are working with someone or teaching someone, you need patience so that you don't hurt their feelings if they can't do something right. They might get angry and not want to be with you. A third reason for patience is that if you know someone who continues to anger or humiliate you, you need to be patient with them. Just ignore the person so you both don't get into trouble. If you didn't have the patience, things could end drastically. That is why you should have patience. Without patience, you can get into trouble, lose a friend, and a lot of other things could go wrong. This is why you need patience.
I have a lot of patience for example the one I really wanted to know @ CAPS1 I made a volleyball team, and I had patience, I didn't complain. I believe that having patience is very respectful to yourself and to others. I once had a test and really wanted to know when we were going to get it, but I had patience. Others didn't have patience they kept asking what we were going to get @ CAPS1 both were complaining about not having patience. Another example is we are going to be going to @ LOCATION1 on @ DATE1 and we always planned for the day I didn't have a rule here at that time, and that made it worse, leaving patience all the more to think about and it worked. Men @ CAPS1 sometimes more secure and patient and sometimes not so much
I woke up to @ NUM1, not feeling very well. I was at my friend's house @ CAPS1. I tried to wait for him to wake up, but I just couldn't wait so I woke him up. I told her I wanted to come home so my mom, and around @ NUM2 my mom came to get me. I told her I thought I was on the ground ????????? Had to wait and wait until we finally got home, it took about two hours until ??? I threw up I was horrible ?????????? illegible
My mother's patience with me and my brother with all the fighting going on, people are killed here, she does not like that we go with that, we returned home late
There was a time when I didn't want to be patient but I had to be. We were going as a family to @ PERSON2 common for a vacation. On the way, as we were on the freeway, about @ NUM1 yards ahead of us, two were fed and the bath was turned off. They were next to the? With anger. Shortly after, the cops came. Keep in mind that we were expecting behind it all. The cops investigated everything and called something. @ NUM2 minutes later a truck bypassed the traffic jam and began to repair the road. I don't know why there was nothing to fix. Finally around and how later we were let pass and continued to drive up to @ PERSON1.
A lot of people are good at being patient, I'm not that good at that. But when you travel long distances, you have to learn to be patient. Several times a year my mom, sister, sometimes my dad, and I drive to my @ LOCATION2's house. She lives about @ NUM1 hours, near @ LOCATION1. My @ LOCATION2 loves family visits, so we don't mind taking a weekend away every few months to visit her. I must have been there at least @ NUM2 times in my life. My mother works nights at a well-known hardware store. Usually she works @ NUM3 @ CAPS1 to @ NUM4 @ CAPS2. So when she got out of work, we packed our bags and left. I always bring my @ CAPS3 with me for entertainment. But most of the time I sleep. Once, I had drunk a lot of pop and I was very, very hyper. I was bothering my mother a lot. So, I put my @ CAPS3 with me for fun. But most of the time I sleep. Once, I had drunk a lot of pop and I was very, very hyper. I was bothering my mother a lot. So I put on my @ CAPS3 and started acting like an idiot, singing the songs. Until my @ CAPS3 dies. I felt my heart break a little. I couldn't fall asleep now. I was still hyper. I started listening to the radio, but we could only listen to country. Ever since we were going @ CAPS7 we had been walking away from the cool radio station control tower. Finally, we reached the “ up store @ CAPS7 ” where we always stop to buy gas and food when we go to @ LOCATION2. I have @ CAPS8 and some more pop. I had a devilish little laugh as I handed the items to my mom. In the car, I finished eating and was bored again. There was nothing to do in this car. I was angry at the time. I looked out the window and sighed. Soon I was asleep. I woke up to the sound of our entering the driveway and my running @ LOCATION2 coming over to say hello. Finally, we were there. I had survived another, ride to @ LOCATION2's house. Then I remembered that we also had to drive home. Even though I do this trip several times a year, I'm pretty sure I'll never stop being bored on the ride. Being patient is not one of my favorite things to do.
I want to go see a movie. There are no movies here at home that I want to see. " @ CAPS1 dad, can I go to the movies with someone ? " I asked. "@ CAPS2 !." @ CAPS3 responded. I looked in which movies there were and it was a pretty good selection. I choose the movie I wanted to see. Then I realize that I need someone to go with me. I called my friend @ CAPS4 and asked her if she wanted to go see the movie I wanted to see. Finally, she wanted to see it that way, she said yes. After that I got something to eat and relaxed. All of a sudden it's time to go. I was running behind. I prepared very quickly and went to get @ CAPS4. Unlike me, she was calm and patient. In his place I would not have been. This is one of the reasons I love @ CAPS4 as a friend.
Do you have patients? I have very? Patient. I ??? going for anything for a long time. When you have the patient, you have to wait for what you want or need.
A time when the patient was when I was going in the place of glasses, and I had to get approval to get glass. So the next day my grandma called and asked if @ PERSON1 was approved and they said "@ CAPS1", my grandma asked how long do I have to wait and they said four weeks so a week elapsed and they called and said my glasses were finished. So the next day we went to get them and that was a time when I was patient.
"@ CAPS1" I fell on my butt again. I tried to throw out a brow full of encouragement. A front-full is a big curvy thing in the air. I almost got it, just couldn't land it. My gymnastics trainer has been very patient with me, he has been working with me for about a month, on this figure. I wanted to make him proud, he's like a brother to me. His name is @ LOCATION1, I've known him for the third year. Every time he sees me he says “ my baby ! " And gives me a hug and a kiss on the forehead. @ PERSON1 can do a lot of amazing things he has participated in many times. He taught me my back swing, the first round I had. His patience helps me, but sometimes not. I'm glad he's patient, but sometimes he's too patient. Sometimes I would prefer him to push me harder. Every time I think he's disappointed with me, I really feel bad. I always give my all when I feel like this. It's an amazing feeling when you get it for him. "@ CAPS1" I feel on my but, again. Instead of the normal enthusiastic "try again" it was flat and boring. I went to the edge of the ground. My adrenaline was racing. I was going to have this! While I was running and jumping, everything was fine. I walked around and landed! For about a second anyway. My feet slipped and from under me @ PERSON1 came up to me smiling. He was proud of me, even though I didn't stick him. We continued to work and finally I got it! I was really happy to tell my cheer trainer, but even happier I did it for @ PERSON1.
The last @ CAPS3 my mom ordered @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and I waited for a whole @ CAPS3. A @ CAPS3, a few months and four months and five months to be exact. Why? Well the game came out this @ CAPS3, the @ DATE1 and I had to wait. How did I spend the time? Simple, don't think about the game, try not to talk about the game, and only write when it comes out on the daily calendars. Even though I have beaten the game exactly thirty-two times on each difficulty without any help. (heh, heh !) I still have to wait a month or so for the call duty : @ CAPS4. So that, uh, stinks because now I can't help but think about it.
Everyone should have patience. Living with patience will help you because sometimes you will need to be patient. Sometimes some people can be patient and some people cannot be patient and I'm one of those people. Sometimes I can be patient and I cannot be patient. Being patient has been a difficult thing for me to overcome. Well, I didn't ! for once i was patience in my life. At that time, many old people walked through the door and finally held the door for all. It wasn't easy because I had to be on a @ CAPS1 date in about @ NUM1 min and that was a lot. It took about @ NUM2 min to wait for everyone to come through the door. But I still continued to hold the door after holding the door, I was late for my date @ CAPS2 everything was still the case if a commin ?? holding the door
I was patient once last year when I was at an amusement park at @ LOCATION2 callnt cedarpaint. I was queuing up to ride an amazing lollermaster called the force @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. It was a very tuff and deliciously ride ?? in the ?? but it lasted ten hours. Standing in the hot, unbearable line hurts, horrible, usually when you're at @ LOCATION1
When I went to get my new phone, I had to be patient because my grandmother loves working with a space person. The man named @ CAPS1 that my grandma and I were waiting for finally came to see us so we went to the phase I wanted and he talked for a long time, but my grandma said if I wasn't patient, I will not have my new phone that day. We move closer to the counter and it shows something about the phone, I want to get out of there so I can look at it myself. My grandma and I are finally leaving and I have my new phone with it and I like it. Name a time you were patient and why you were patient !
A time when I was patient was with the doctors. The doctor took too long and I was patient and I was patient for the doctor to come back into the room. I was a @ DATE1 @ TIME1 and my mom and I are going to the doctor because I had an appointment. I had them and the doctor called me and took me to a room and like @ NUM1 minutes later he came back. All the while we were expecting each other and my mom was talking about things. I love what takes so long and my mom said I don't know but wait. Then the doctor comes and starts asking me quads like what I eat, and what I do to exercise and say. I do not know. Then, after stepping on the foursome, they apologize for keeping you patient and give my mom some papers, then we go down the stairs and I had to go to a lab to get my blood. There were a lot of people and I was patient, then they called me and took my blood when I was patient with my mother at the doctors.
We go, I'm patient and I'm in the middle, patience is waiting or just sitting with someone you don't like. Once, when I was little, I wasn't very patient. My mom wants to say a few seconds and I would say @ NUM1. But when I grew up I was more patient. For example, I was patient with teachers, peers, and parents, but there are times when I always have a non-patient side, I will try not to be patient, but sometimes it does. I like having someone to talk to, but sometimes I can't talk to them because I'm not patient. My friends are really good about it first although sometimes they don't my mom is really patient but my dad isn't so maybe get it from him i don't really talk to my dad well that i am not patient i am really outgoing and funny. I have a lot of friends because I'm outgoing sometimes I get in trouble because I'm outgoing and there is a blown side to it. I like to talk and have fun, maybe if I was more patient it would be more fun. I work my patience. I think I can do a lot better than what I used to do and maybe if I get more patient I will improve in school, but I know I will do my best in the area of patience. In conclusion, I need more patience, but patience is something that I can work on defiantly.
Patience. Wow, you want the criticism ; are you sure? We are going since you asked for it, it looks like I have to give it to you. Patience is @ CAPS2 my cousins, uncles, aunts and even you and I need (@ CAPS1 these days. We need it pretty much every day.) @ CAPS2 does the keyword patience mean ? Patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. It also means that you are having trouble without complaining. Or, in my own words, long suffering and also being able to wait until @ CAPS2 what you wanted is done. Being patient is something that I don't follow all the time but have to be. As my dad tells me all the time, you are not always going to get or receive everything you want, so you will have to learn patience. It's a word I don't like @ CAPS1 when it's something I really want. So this is my story about patience explained my way.
There is a time when I have to have patience sometimes, it is in class that I have to have patience. I don't have much patience. I must have patience in the block @ NUM1 @ NUM1 block is a moth. As students we have @ PERSON1. @ PERSON2 talks all the time. He talks until lunch, which lasts about half an hour. So I have to wait a bit for him to give us work. This is how I have patience. To conclude that when I have to have patience in class. Although I don't have much patience at all, but in class yes.
"@ CAPS1 was going to be late !" my little cousin @ PERSON1 yelled from across the room. She was wearing her big blue snow coat and pretty red boots. She started jumping all over the place and it made me laugh easily. "@ CAPS1 was going to be late !" my little cousin @ PERSON1 yelled from across the room. She was wearing her big blue snow coat and pretty red boots. She started jumping all over the place and it made me laugh easily. You see, I was going on a ski trip with my parmls, my cousin @ PERSON1, and her parents. I was estaric. My parents spent a lot of time talking to parents about @ PERSON1 before we left, so @ PERSON1 was a little whiny about not going yet. I tried to ???? " @ PERSON1, would you like to play @ CAPS3 ? I asked safely, patting his shoulder. When I said that, his eyes seemed to grow twice as large. "@ CAPS4 ! @ CAPS4! @ CAPS4! Madison yeah! I wanna play, I wanna play! @ PERSON1 shouted ??? . Although she sounded like" ??? " I smiled and we started off to play tro. She would guess ??? I would let her win. ??? was so ??? and I think I made her more patient to leave by helping her play a game. Finally, my parents got out and we started our skitrip. Patience had paid off.
Once I was patient when my little brother took a shower and had to go to the bathroom. So I waited and sure enough he locked the door so I tried to pick it up with a toothpick it didn't work. Then I said to my dad and he said "be a man you can hold yourself in" so that didn't work either so I was about to pull the door off the hinges and then he is walked straight out and smiled at me so i went to the bathroom and he was soaked in water so i yelled at him and that's when i was patient.
I must always be patient. It's because I have an older brother who doesn't do what he's told. Let's say my dad tells him to clean the bathroom, well it takes ten minutes to get up, then I have to go when he cleans and he won't leave me. So I am that is one of the reasons. Another is my older sister, she's always on the phone so I hardly ever use her. So I wait for my parents to come home so that they shout for him to come down, that's why I'm very patient.
It was @ DATE1 and I could see the snow falling as I drank hot chocolate. I saw that our @ DATE1 tree was full of presents, I couldn't wait to be able to open them. I want a Wii since @ DATE1 but never had one. But that didn't stop me from hoping. So I would like to have one this year. After a while my parents said @ CAPS2 can open our freebies. "@ CAPS1" I screamed, quickly tore off the wrapping paper and saw I had a makeup kit, digital camera, and more. But not a Wii. I was frustrated. So I asked my mom if @ CAPS2 could buy the Wii tomorrow. But she replied "@ CAPS2 can't afford it. @ CAPS2 will buy it when @ CAPS2 has enough money. Well I was very patient so I guess I could wait. Like @ CAPS2 all enjoyed our @ DATE1 @ CAPS2 watched TV. Then after about a week my parents got their paycheck so my mom said @ CAPS2 could go out and buy the Wii. "@ CAPS3" thank you "mom" I screamed. When @ CAPS2 came to the ?? I got the Wii and her ?? which was @ MONEY1. I couldn't believe it my patient finally paid. Now I have my new Wii and @ CAPS4 take advantage of every second.
Many people around the world are patient. However, I think my @ CAPS1 is the most patient person in the world. I think this because she was born in the dimension, she had to be patient for food, money and water. She couldn't just go out and buy food from the grocery store. She had to be patient to go and make her own food. If she wanted popcorn she would get some corn shells and then put them in a pot and then put on a fire and who knows how long that might take. Finally, wait for the shells to explode. It's the war that keeps you from putting a bag in the microwave and pushing a button. This is how she is also fooled with ??? even with me. That's why I think she's the most patient person in the world.
Being patient is one of the many important things in life that we have to deal with if you are impatient, and then people will say that you are impatient and need to calm down. Being patient also means that you are a polite person and that you will not complain about anything, also that no matter what happens you will be understanding and will wait. Let's say someone was in line to get food. You will have to wait your turn to get your food while the other person gets their food. She is being an understanding and polite person and sometimes even a role model for the children / children of the litter. You lead by example and are considerate. There are many reasons why being patient takes understanding and consideration.
My brother and I have been asking for a dog for a while, every month mom and dad said they are going to have one every month with a dog @ CAPS1 a fish. Mom would search for dogs online and dad would search for dogs online and dad would search through the paper. Colin and I told them Dayliey was going to feed him well, walk him, give him water on my birthday like @ NUM1 days before @ NUM2, they said we were going to have a dog! tomorrow ! It was @ NUM1: 00 at night so we couldn't fall asleep because we were so happy! in the morning @ CAPS2 to @ NUM4 we got in the car mom said the place was in shit so it couldn't be that far. Colin and we were so happy we got home and there was @ NUM5 dogs little fluffy dogs a white @ NUM6 black I told my mom I wanted geher @ CAPS3 told me it was to daddy daddy loved it so it means @ CAPS4. We called her variable patient. and our patients wore it worth it.
A warrior named @ PERSON1 was patiently waiting for his sword, he had been waiting for an hour. He just sat quietly while everyone was screaming. He was happy. All he could think of was his @ CAPS1. He loved swords so much. He had @ NUM1 as his swords. So he had to patiently retrieve his sword. Then he fought ninjas. He went after the ninjas for going after a boy named @ PERSON2. Then he reduced them to dust. The sword was made of magic. Then the warrior and @ PERSON2 went to school. The warrior was the teacher and @ PERSON2 was the student.
My story when I was patient was when my family and I went to monster jam. It was one of the most exciting things in my life. But the trip there was almost @ NUM1 ! then it took half an hour to find a place to park. Then eleast @ NUM2 minutes for my mom friends to introduce themselves. And finally an hour in line. Last but not less @ NUM3 minutes to find our seat ! thank you for listening to my patience report and sitting on it !
There was a time when I really wanted to go somewhere, and my mom said "@ CAPS1 not tonight", because it was a school night. So I said "okay, I know it's a school night", @ CAPS2 at least I said it with politeness and loyalty ! and this is a time where i was loyal to someone and here is a time i fought for someone, well my best friend was fighting this other girl and it was in person and I went up to my friends @ CAPS3 "enimey" and said why don't you come home and leave my friend alone and she replied to me then we finally started to ignore then she left, that's a moment she stood up for my best friend while she was arguing. "
When I had to go to the doctor. I had thought I would be ahead. There were over @ NUM1 people online when we got there, it was even more crowded. I had to take my pictures. So we had to wait patiently. But my mom couldn't wait because there were so many people out front. So I fell asleep. She was still walking. So when I woke up, five people had already passed by. She still couldn't be patient, still walking around making me nervous, then another @ NUM2 came by very slowly. Then she finally cooled down. She was so patient because they said they were going to kick her out. I have never seen her so patient that it was unbelievable.
When I was in the sub-line and at grade @ NUM1, I waited patiently. If you cut in front of me, I wouldn't care. That when I waited @ NUM2 minutes and the queue was still long. My patience meter went down after @ NUM3 minutes, I was finally able to get a sub. I waited @ NUM4 minutes for a sub that looks like waiting for a pizza. When I got to the cashier I had no more money in my account, so I was really angry, angry that you haven't received any money for a year.
I once was patient when my brother broke his arm. I had a great day and I was playing outside on the playground, during lunch breaks. He said he was on the monkey bars. His hands got sweaty and he slipped. Eric fell on his arm. He cried. The waitresses took him to the office and called my parents. Then my parents called my school to tell them they were coming to pick me up. They came to get me and then disturbed me. We drove to the hospital and they did x-rays. It took forever. I sat there quietly for @ NUM1 hours ! My parents told me that they now appreciate that I was very patient. This is the time when I was patient.
My story in my own way about patience is when there are like @ NUM1 people in front of a line at another point. You have to be patient in the lines because others were before you so you have to wait your turn before you go as this is called cutting and you will be kicked out of places if you do that you don't want this is happening because like saying you want something to eat, you have to wait your turn not to be kicked off the rides, you have to wait your turn so as not to have the secret on you.
One time I was patient I was fishing with my grandpa in the north and we were sitting there all day and we must have walked the canal at least @ NUM1 times. And each time we had bites but never caught a fish. We tried our usual routine but it wasn't working very well so I decided to change it up a bit. I gave my grandfather the idea to turn around and head for Shigle Bay. He agreed, but the only problem was that there were a lot of rocks where we were going and the last thing we need is for the propeller to break. But we took a chance and moderated where we were where I told him to go and as soon as we get into the bag bam! We see the pale bend so far it was hard to believe it was a fish so I took the net and my grandpa grabbed the pole and started to understand that we finally brought it up on the surface and it was a wallege from @ NUM2 ", we smiled and it looks like we had fish that night, this is the story of when my patients were tested by fish and then I caught the biggest of the lake !
"@ CAPS1 activated!" I said. We were in the waiting room at my father's doctor's office. My father is going to a special doctor. It was very boring. There was also a maninge sale going on, so my sister and. I went looking for @ CAPS3 while my dad was reading a book. morning we were there for @ CAPS2 ! It was the meals I brought on the day of my life. The doctor was very slow and they were stupid, "I told my father that he was patient. He was also a ??? sell ??? @ CAPS3 and doctors that we want, @ CAPS3 the sale of rummy, they had dishes, food, jewelry and diaring.my sideroad i had a ??? krispey treat.my sider also had a hol.Her hat was cool.I also had a ?? ? I ??? gl blue, purple, pink and sarcastically. fimlly they called my father. my father went into a patient room - when my dad @ CAPS1 came out, he said he was in good health " They gave him his prescription and we left. In conclusion, we should be patient with people. Patient is kindness. I am always patient with people. I hope you are also patient with people."
One day at the start of Foll, @ PERSON1 was looking at @ CAPS1.V. As she watched, an ad pops up saying the latest film, in a very popular series, hits theaters tomorrow night. The day after school, everyone was excited. They couldn't all @ CAPS1 wait to see the movie that night. Finally comes the time to go get the tickets. When @ PERSON1 arrived, a huge queue had already formed. @ PERSON1 was waiting, then she realized that her best friend, @ PERSON2, was in front of her. Then the popular rich girl showed her lime. His name was @ CAPS2. She walked over to the box office and cut everyone in line. She tried to pay extra for a better seat and because she cut people off in the line. The ticket seller said she would just have to stand in line like everyone else. This drove @ CAPS2 crazy, and because she didn't queue at @ CAPS1 when she arrived, more people lined up. But all the while @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 were talking. Since they were patient time went by and the next thing they found out was they were buying tickets. But @ CAPS2 thought it took forever to get her tickets because she wasn't patient.
I was patient when I went to Cediar Point. I had to queue along the tine for ??? for priencse there were a lot of people @ CAPS1 the longest word ??? drogster. I had almost an hour to take a walk with @ NUM1, teenager ??? It's the ???.
One day my family and I all went to point @ CAPS1. I was so excited. When we got there I rushed out of the car. We got our ticket and a map, then decided which route we wanted to take. We were going to go on the dragon @ CAPS2 there was such a long line. I felt like he wasn't even moving. I have been as patient as possible. I was so excited to try this ride that the family finally made a move !!! We were next door. We all sat down and made sure we were tight. The roller coaster was about a few minutes, well worth the wait. It was then that he was patient.
A @ DATE1 @ TIME1 I was in the locked store @ CAPS1 creem store frasty's The queue was huge. There were @ CAPS2 on @ NUM1 people there and I was in the @ CAPS3 line that was waiting there. Think about what I'm going to get. One by one, @ CAPS4 took the lead. Until a little old lady hadn't yet decided what she was going to get, I sat and waited while she chatted about the prices if it was sugar free, what toppings it was. was on it, @ CAPS5, @ CAPS5, @ CAPS5. Finally, she ordered. I'm on the front line and all of a sudden a group of people come in. I guess @ CAPS4 "held its place online". There were at @ CAPS2 @ NUM2 of them shouting at person @ CAPS8 the glass indicating a ship of rocks leaving. Finally the order was made and I was standing @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 I could talk to this sweet old lady who asked "May I cut the deer in front of you?" I had to say yes it wouldn't be nice @ CAPS2 if I didn't. this is my story on Being patient.
My brother Matt was never the patient type. He is always very frustrated whenever something or someone takes too long. You always have to be patient with Matt, but everything changed one day. Me, my mom, my nephew, Matt and his girlfriend decided to go get something to eat. While we were there and waiting in line I made a bet with Matt's girlfriend. The bet however was many impatient comments that he said she owed me two dollars for each. If he wasn't making impatient comments, I owed him two dollars. After the waitress took our orders and left, we all started talking. The adults talked about work and stuff, while me and @ PERSON1, my nephew talked about school and stuff too. It took at least a few minutes. The few minutes lost, we watched the football game that was going on. During those few minutes, including the few minutes we were talking, I didn't hear Matt make an impatient comment. I was really impressed. I was upset that I owed Matt's girlfriend two dollars.
Once, when I was patient, I went hunting with my mother. It takes a lot of patience to do this. When my mother and I were sitting in the deer blind, she was preparing her crossbow for the arrival of a deer. But we were sitting there for about @ NUM1 hours. I was about to lose my patients, but a few deer arrived, a mother deer and her fawn. My mother didn't want to shoot the mother or the fawn, because then the fawn would be on its own. So we waited for more deer to come in, but none did. But I still had my patience in me. when it started to get cold and dark we thought there would be no more deer, so we came home and besides my mom was starting to lose a little patience. But that's when I waited a little while.
When I think of patience, I usually think of my mother and her tolerance and understanding. Even when she explained something to me about @ NUM1 times that I still don't understand, she helps me out without complaining. A good example of this is when she and my dad taught me to ride a bike. @ CAPS1 was @ DATE1 time and I was about five years old. My dad was at work and my mom and I were bored, so she went to the garage and pulled out my new bike. My dad told me you had to turn the handlebars before you crashed, but I kept forgetting and falling. Disappointed that @ CAPS1 was not easy, I gave up a little later. Now, however, my mom kindly persuaded me to try again. Hanging on to the bike, she told me to pedal. She let go and shouted, "Turn around!" Turn! " But @ CAPS1 was no use. I turned the wrong way and rolled over on the grass. " @ CAPS1 is fine. You almost got @ CAPS1 ! " Mom said, rushing toward me. Putting on a good face, I tried again. Again and again I tried to ride a bike. Not once was angry with me, mom helped me up. On my last try before @ CAPS1 was time to come home my mom let it go and I drove on my own, around the corner and back ! When I got back we both did little dances, my mom congratulated me and we called my dad to brag about my new achievement. For me, my mother was patient that day. She didn't let me give up and she never complained. Overall, my mom is a perfect example of patience, and because of that, she taught me how to ride a bike!
You have to try to be patient with homework. Once, while doing my homework, I began to be hospitalized. Because I was struggling. But my dad said he was going to help me @ CAPS1 he told me to be patient. @ CAPS1 I sat there and I sat down. And I stayed patient as long as I could and then he helped me a lot. I'm usually not patient when it comes to homework or anything like that. You @ CAPS2 must do your best to be patient.
Everyone has been patient at some point in their time. I know I have. One year my brother and I had a project to do. That we both needed a computer to finish. I let my brother go first. Since there is a computer in the house, I have to wait. After hours, I checked to see if my brother was about to finish. He wasn't, but I remembered then that he was a slow typist. He finished the next day. I had no problem with this because I had plenty of time to type my paper. This is the time when I was patient.
One time I was patient was when I went to camp. Had to wait @ NUM1 hours until we got to camp. I mostly slept and ate, we also watched movies on drive @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1. We finally got theirs, but I had to wait a bit longer to check in and had to wait for the rain to stop so I could get my things back to our cabin. Then we waited for the chapel to start, but there was more to do there like tennis, volleyball, or sit by the dining room and talk to a friend, or read to the last. times in your cabin. When the bell rang, we all entered the programming center and waited for the chapel to end. We had a lot of patients at the end of the week. Ohh at lunch we had to wait a few seconds because their food was so good. Finally, I had to wait @ NUM1 hours on the way home. It was a time when I had patience. (Many).
One day on earth, an alien race arrived. They were called "@ CAPS1". They wanted these things called @ ORGANIZATION2 balls that would summon an @ ORGANIZATION2 and that would make you wish. @ NUM1 strong fighters, @ CAPS2, @ ORGANIZATION1 had to stop them. But they were too strong. @ ORGANIZATION1 was already dead then trained with the king @ CAPS3 but the others were waiting @ ORGANIZATION1. Finally, he came and beat the grime out of them. The earth was saved.
One day after school I was told I had a doctor's appointment so I "say when and my mom said @ NUM1 and I had an after school dance that started @ NUM2 so I say @ CAPS1 I have a dacen a @ NUM2 and she said bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla! At least that's what I herd @ CAPS1 I was wrong. "@ CAPS1 mom c 'is my first dance "I said angrily @ CAPS1 she asked me to get in the car so when and we stood in the waiting room for an hour. them, we were finally at the office and headed home us to get ready for the dance and we had a great time.
Patience, you should have patience for all of this. If you don't have patience here are things that can happen, once my firend sisters wanted to cross the ride and she didn't want to wait she didn't look both ways and a car came and she ran out, collapsed and was hit by the car. She had cuts and burns all over, she was taken to the hispoteli where me, my sister and my mother went to see her on the day of the accident. She was all cut up and couldn't really walk. She had so many cuts that someone had to help her walk so later maybe a mouth after being hit she went to the doctors because she kept having really bad head acts . They said she had something called a coma as if she had a little coma. So that's what happens when you don't have patience even for something as small as crossing the road, you have to be patient for it. But if you have patience good things like a story like this once my mom told me to wait in the car and have the windows open and look on. So I did, I was really bored and about to get out, but I saw some guys trying to open a car window. So I dressed my cell phone and went to the back and sat on the gorond and called @ NUM1. They were on the way, they were in the alley. Now that they got out of their cars and ran over to the guys and got them back they soon found out that the guys at @ NUM2 were guys they were looking for so I got some money to catch them . The money made known was @ NUM3 dollars. So my patience with not getting out of the car made me money. Saved my life because they would have killed me if they had seen me and helped me find bad guys. So something patience can save lives and help find baddies you never know what you might get by having patience, so this is my story about having patients and what they can bring you. So, you should always have patience.
One person I know was very patient once I partnered with her. This person was waiting for a call or email that was promised. The call or email was about a very dominant basketball team in the state. The person calling or emailing the person I was with was the coach of that team. He saw the person I was with, who was my brother, playing in a tournament downstate at @ LOCATION1. The coach was there to recruit players for his @ CAPS1 team. He watched a game of my brother and approached him after the game. They talked about the team and he told her he would be a great asset to the team. My brother said he would love to play for him so he gave the coach our phone number and email address. The coach said he would contact him within @ NUM1 days at most. On the way home my brother kept checking his emails as it took us @ NUM1 days to get home. On the @ CAPS2 day, the trainer never called or emailed him. The second day still nothing. My brother was very patient for it to come and he never stressed out that it wouldn't. On the third day of our trip home, my brother was very understanding when my mom told him that this might not happen. So we get home at @ NUM3 hours and I'm starting to doubt my brother brother made the team. Then the phone rings. My brother spoke for a while then hung up and said he was on the team. It was once my brother was patient.
A wise man once said that patience is a virtue. Let's see if this sage is right. I am going back @ DATE1 years. I had just spoken to my parents I said. "@ CAPS1, will you call me this lego for @ CAPS2?" "@ CAPS3", @ CAPS5 said then @ CAPS5 asked me to move out. I gently pulled away from her and @ CAPS5 ordered it. It was @ DATE1 when I asked him "@ CAPS1 do you know my lego is coming?" @ CAPS5 said "it should be here before or after @ CAPS2". I replied with a @ CAPS7.K .. it was the week before @ CAPS2 I had sorted the mail. "no package" I said to myself. So I checked the porch for nothing. A week after @ CAPS2, the mail arrived. In addition to a package that I could see. It turns out that the sage was right, patience is a virtue. This is the time when I was patient. I also learned that it was better to wait for certain things.
One day my mom and dad were looking for a vacation on the internet. They stumbled across vacationing at @ LOCATION1, a location just outside of crossing town. We decided to go for @ NUM1 days, it was going to start next month. I was excited to go but I still had enough patience to wait and wait for people to call us to tell us that we could go (while waiting for our reservation) to @ LOCATION1. When the day finally arrived, I was really excited. We packed everything and ready to go, even the dogs were good to go. After putting the dogs inside, we started to go. We had to get the dogs to go to my grandmothers because they had no other place to go so we dropped them off and started heading to @ LOCATION1 and it was four o'clock of road. When we were about an hour away, my sister got really impatient and kept asking if we were still there, but I sat there and looked out the window. Then we got to a pit stop and got our water and drinks. My mom and dad wanted coffee, so they tried to get some, but it didn't work. Then we were patient all the way to @ LOCATION1.
Can you @ CAPS1 have a time in your life when you had to wait for something for a very long time. I had to wait a long time. Do you think you knew what it is? that was the day before @ CAPS2. I was only five years old at the time. So I woke up on the eve of @ CAPS2 looking forward to tomorrow. I've been telling myself that all day. I went out to try and waste time but it didn't help as it was freezing outside. It was therefore necessary to go into the house immediately. I had nothing to do. So I just waited, then “@ CAPS4” my brother got up and I played with him all day until we had to go to bed. Then it was time to go to bed and I ran straight to my room and got into bed and woke up the next morning and was so happy I didn't have to wait anymore. Had to wait forever, I was so happy that day, but I know @ CAPS5 thirteen and I really don't care, but I would still love to hear about your not someday.
I was at @ ORGANIZATION1, queuing for a ride I really wanted to do, I was in a huge queue ! It was like a big dominus line. I don't like to wait in long lines. Like most children, I don't make wine and I don't mind waiting. In my head I'm thinking when I should shop around. I don't scream or scream, I just try to stand still and wait. The second continues. tick tock tick tock. I'm just waiting for the line to get shorter and shorter. A few minutes later, it was finally my turn to ride the roller coaster, I was so excited! I took the tour, it was fantastic! The only thing is it was only a minute! that line I had to wait in was like an hour. Of course well. This line was worth it.
On @ DATE1 my two friends and I were all laughing, but then I remembered that at @ NUM1 min I had to have dinner. So I walked in and my friends were so patient. They didn't leave me so I ran as fast as I could so as not to keep them waiting. After we finished we went back to the park and played on the swing. Then we walked back to my house because they had to leave and go home. It was my @ DATE1. It was fun.
@ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 lives in Ohio. He goes to college @ CAPS2 and the day after school he was walking home when @ CAPS3 his friend asked him to wait in the parking lot so he could call his mom and ask if @ CAPS4 could stay home for the weekend. @ CAPS4 had to wait a full half hour while @ CAPS3 was talking and chatting with his mother. But after @ CAPS3 finished speaking he thanked @ CAPS4 for his patience and they all spent the weekend at @ CAPS8's house.
Once I was on the beat, that was when I wanted an I-pod tuch. My grandmother was bidding on an I-pod tuch. It took a while to get it, but we won. It took them a long time to ship it, but we got it. In the end, it all paid off.
If you were someone sitting next to me on a bus on the way to @ LOCATION2, you would call me patient. Although if you were my best friend and it was the day before to take me to @ CAPS1 from @ LOCATION1, that's another story. I'll tell you anyway. My best friend @ PERSON1 and I had been talking on the phone everyday for at least an hour every day for about two weeks straight. Finally, @ PERSON1 asked me. What if I wanted to go to @ CAPS1 from @ LOCATION1 the next @ DATE1 ! Sure. I said yes, and soon enough it was planned that I would pass the @ TIME2 on @ DATE2 and leave @ DATE1 for @ CAPS3 with it. The next few days were boring, just staying home and babysitting my brothers. It seemed a millennium later that @ DATE3 @ TIME1 came along. @ PERSON1 called and said I probably wouldn't be able to pass the @ TIME2, but we still had to leave for @ CAPS3 at @ NUM1: ooam on @ DATE1. I said I was okay with that, but I was still very disappointed. @ DATE2 came and it was complete torture. I looked after my brothers, but there was nothing to occupy us. We tried to run around the house several times, but it only took about ten minutes. We then decided it was time for a movie. We watched @ CAPS5 to burn off at least two hours of free time. We had lunch and after that things happened very quickly to compensate for the slowness of the passage. I talked to Kenzie for at least two hours, then my parents came home and everything went as usual. Then it was time to go to bed. I threw and turned my sheets, but couldn't fall asleep. Kenzie ended up calling me at @ NUM2 just to tell me she was eating a piece of pizza, which didn't help at all. Finally, I fell into a necessary depth. The next morning, I got dressed, packed my bags and was ready to go. Kenzie, her mom and brothers arrived and we finally left for a sweet day @ DATE4 from @ LOCATION1's @ CAPS1. The ride there seemed like five minutes, but it was a good thing. We were there! We did tons of sweet rides and had @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 for dessert. I was both patient and impatient at times. Now you know for me if I am very impatient, but if it's something smaller I can wait.
I was patient when I was at school when my teacher left the room. The children started to go mad and they were standing on tables. Throw paper @ ORGANIZATION1 from planes and paper into @ ORGANIZATION1. The kids were screaming and I was just sitting there watching as the teacher comes in and sees what's going on. I'm just sitting there because I'm amazed at how good they are doing. Then I watch them get into trouble and get calls at home. I think it's a good thing I didn't make it because I could get kicked from the cross country team. The children are suspended for lunch. I hope this will never happen to me again because I was just a witness who can cause more trouble for children.
Once I was patient, it was last year when my dad took me hunting. It all started when we woke up to @ NUM1 in the morning, got dressed and left to blindly enter. As soon as we got there we heard a lot of gunshots. Shotguns, shotguns and even black powder. We waited all day until it got dark again, then packed our bags and left. My dad and I haven't seen anything all day. It's a story of how patient I am.
One day I was going hunting and patiently waiting for my dad to get dressed. When he finally did, we headed for the woods. After that, we entered a blind, patiently waiting for fifty minutes. Just then a deer came in. She was a perfect doe. Finally, the deer gets in front of the blind man about @ NUM1 or @ CAPS1 and my dad says softly "wait until he turns sideways". @ CAPS1 I waited for him to turn and pull on the doe. Eventually we got out and found my arrow, but we never found the deer and I had to wait for the next year's hunt.
I once wanted this awesome @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 looked awesome so I asked my mom and she said we and this tomorrow so I waited and waited. I was very patient but started to get a little irritated because it was taking so long. I was a little impatient I didn't complain but still want @ CAPS3 to this day just need to be patient.
Brother @ CAPS1 was patient, brother @ CAPS1 was patient understanding a tolerant. He understands a toleran by lingering in waiting. He was waiting at the doctor for steches. I was patient in going with him. We are always patient when we have to wait for something, another time I was patient is when I always get my hair cut @ CAPS1 or the hairline. Had to wait a long time to get my hair cut @ CAPS1. It was one of the times when I had to be patient.
One day I had a doctor's appointment and I had to check in at the office and after that I had to sit and be patient until the doctors called me back to do my exam and I wait for the real doctor to come to see how I was feeling and to see if I was eating right, then I had to go to the cashier to see what my next checkup was, then I had to get my pills refilled and then I went home.
I was patient once was when my mom said she would buy me an @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS1.
These stories are about times when I was patient. It's a story, so once my caretaker was putting my winter clothes away this @ DATE1 and I told him my good clothes like that and I was like there wasn't really any winter clothes, she said she knew and she said i was putting them on just because she said i had a lot of things that were the same color and i was trying to talk back then i was like o i see what you are saying because i couldn't fit everything in my dresser so i just wait and help put on my clothes. Patient means can you do something someone asks you to or can you do the right thing to people. Or can you help someone when you think they are contributing something.
Once upon a time I was at the doctor and it was very sacred. So well my mother went to give the boy the information about me I was sitting next to this lady and her daughter was crying when my mother came back and the doctors were shouting names I was trying to be patient so I got up and the children's playground and started to play. A few minutes later the doctors finally called my name, so we got to @ NUM1 the doctors called me at @ NUM2 pm. So they gave me a chance to sit and play for @ NUM3 minutes, they gave me mods and told me to go get the starch and to have a problem I wanna go to @ CAPS1 / pharmacy and that's when I was patient.
I was crying while waiting for my own phone so I texted my friends and called them and more. I was also waiting to get my own snowmobile licenses to be able to drive my own snowmobile on the trails. Know what you are, always be patient.
Playing hockey is important to me. I am a goaltender who plays for Farmton Hills. Playing on goal requires skill to have "thick skin" and above all to be patient. Every game day daddy @ CAPS2 tells me " be cool, calm and get together " the three @ CAPS1 (as I call him). I walk on the ice and patiently wait for the puck to come from @ CAPS2. Once it's done, I'm in action. The pirod ends and I wait patiently. The second pirod is there, I wait for the blow of the puck, hoping that we scare. @ CAPS3 !!! @ CAPS3 !!! @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 @ CAPS2 patience has helped it's @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 ! The third pirod comes @ CAPS3 !! Big @ CAPS4 by @ ORGANIZATION1 (that's me) ! @ CAPS3 !! Goooaaall !! @ NUM5 to @ NUM2. that's it, the game is over! I waited patiently for this win against the @ LOCATION1. After the game we are all going to party at @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 to celebrate a big win. And we all had a great time doing it, too.
It is the story of a time when I patiently waited for a plain in an airport. We were on our way to @ LOCATION1 and had to take two plains to get there. When we left the plain for the second airport, we went to see what time our second flights arrived. When we found out the time of the second flight we were shocked as we had to wait six hours for it to arrive. mom told me i had to be patient but i'm not good at being patient. To take my mind off things, we decided to eat. When I have finished eating. I was about to scream because I wanted to go, but I remembered to be patient. So I went to the gift shop to get it out of my head. Only three hours had passed and it bothered me. So I started playing on my DS. Before I knew it we only had an hour left, so playing my ds distracted me. I got impatient really quickly, so that's when my sister and I started messing around. All of a sudden our plain arrives I was so happy. My mom was so proud of me for being so patient that she bought me something from the gift shop. So I finally learned to be patient.
There were times when I had to be patient. This time I went to the dentist, we got there and sat down. Let me tell you something I hate the dentist. So we probably sat there for an hour or two. But only one good thing I had was to miss school. I think we had a test that day. I think the worst place to go is the dentist and the doctor. The only thing about the doctor is that you don't have to wait that long. It means you can come and go. But sometimes you have to be patient. Like when you get a job or an interview. Good thing, patience can get you to great places. Being patient is a polite way to do it. So if you are all prepared you want to go the patient route. Not being patient is just disrespectful. It's like treating things like dirt. Patience is like manners at the table, pleasant and professional. If I were if you were patient it would lead you to a good future.
The patient is very important if there was no patience, everyone would be irritated all the time. if there was no patience we wouldn't be able to get through the day, we would constantly be looking at the clock thinking when am I going to go out. Some people have no patience and some have no patience. It could affect the way everyone acts towards each other, no patience could affect the smallest things we all struggle with because we had to line up in a store or count money. It could change the lifestyle of everyone on the planet. Patience is one of the most important things on the planet. Patiences helps us make the right choice. Instead of someone asking you a question and you responding right away, you wait and make the best decision. Although many of us think, on patience I can sum up that right now it's more than waiting, it's accepting something you don't like. It'll also throw life away without saying why I can't do what or you can't because I can't. The world would not be what it is without patience.
Patience, something you must have when you want to be friends with someone. This story is about a young girl and a boy who want to be friends, but one of them just doesn't have the patience. I entered the room where the speech competition was being held. I sat next to all of my friends and they all thought I would get first place. When I went with a friend of mine he said he just had a little too much cologne because he was really nervous and didn't know what he was doing. @ CAPS2 we actually knew he and I were friends. After I went upstairs to see which number I was, I saw that I was the first to speak. My friend said I would do good, and he was right after me. I quickly started talking about lady @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1 I loved my talk! After we, my friend @ ORGANIZATION1 and I had finished our speeches, we both sat next to each other and talked a lot. Then after all our friends asked us if we were friends? I said, "@ CAPS2 way why would I be friends with him?" then @ CAPS1 laughed. We both glared at each other. After a few days we won't be talking anymore because @ CAPS1 was so suspicious. I was very patient and was able to wait to talk to him. But of course @ ORGANIZATION1 was not patient at all. He couldn't wait to tell @ CAPS1 that he and me were friends but we couldn't tell anyone because they were both different but the truth is we are both exactly the same since we all love them. both soccer, basketball, music and talk like @ NUM1. Haha ! Soon @ CAPS1 found out. @ ORGANIZATION1 had left and told @ CAPS1 that we were friends. Turns out @ CAPS2 laughed at us. They were actually happy that @ ORGANIZATION1 had the patience of @ CAPS2 and finally told them that we were friends. Now me and @ ORGANIZATION1 are best friends and will be forever ! In conclusion, @ CAPS3 having patience is good but sometimes people can't have patience when they want to be friends.
Once when I was patient was when my family cousins and I went @ LOCATION1 and my sister was ill. Me and my other sister sat in my car. For about two and a half hours. My sister got annoyed but I stood there patiently. My mom and sister spent a very long time at the doctor's office ! my sister went to the doctor's office three times. But I was very patient, when she wasn't at the doctor all she wanted to do was lay down so we barely had to do fun stuff. By the end of the trip she was feeling better so my mom took us to do something fun. It was a time when I was patient.
Being patient is waiting your turn in line and the @ CAPS3 cup you should wait because the inline cup is @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 and @ CAPS1 disrespectful. and you won't have friends. Being patient is respectful of others, and others will be your friend. @ CAPS1 @ CAPS3 be respectful when you are not waiting your turn. @ CAPS1 when you do something your mom and dad are talking to another adult @ CAPS1 made up on to rush things when other people don't want to do something with you. Or pestering to leave somewhere like an aunts 'or uncles' house. @ CAPS1 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 when you are not waiting. Be respectful and wait until it's a better way to make friends. And if someone @ CAPS3 is respectful to you, tell them to be. And then walk away and say @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 to @ CAPS3 wait and be patient. Grrr.
I felt a chill in my body. We were @ NUM1 seconds from the opening of @ ORGANIZATION1. I had to wait @ NUM2 minutes to go to space mountain. I wish I could have skipped all the lines but knew I had to wait. When I got off I knew it was totally worth it. At the end of the day, I begged to take one more turn. Again, I had to wait @ NUM3 minutes to continue. The ride showed the boring story of @ CAPS1. Then in the end it gave us a screen and we chose the future and showed a funny cartoon with our faces on it.
Have you ever looked after small children? If you have, then you know how much patience it takes. It was my little cousin's third birthday party, and as the oldest, it was my responsibility to look after the younger ones. At first everything was fine. The children played quietly with the plastic kitchen, offering me fake food. Then one of them started playing with the popper ball. Of course, if a child has a new toy, the others immediately stop what they are doing and will play with the toy as well. So, all the little children gathered around the pepper ball, laughing with joy as the machine spotted plastic balls in the air. Suddenly a little girl reached out and snatched a ball in the air, causing the other children to fight for the balls and scream. I yelled at them to stop, but when they ignored me and continued to fight, I realized it would take a lot of patience. I calmly removed the popper balloon and waited for them to settle in. Fortunately, my little cousins have stopped fighting and were able to play quietly with chili. I learned an important lesson from my cousin's birthday party: babysitting takes a lot of patience!
"@ CAPS1 !!" I had another home math assignment tomorrow and I was already fed up with math. Every day my fourth grade teacher gave us home math homework which was really long and difficult. Some days I would come home and cry because it was really hard. My mom and dad always told me to be patient and stay calm. I never wanted to be patient because it never worked for me. Every day I would come home to sit at the table, take my time and work. @ NUM1 problems a day was difficult for a fourth grader. Every time the math started, I would take out my homework and wait to check it. I never did any wrong. @ CAPS2 I have always been proud of my work. But when it came to getting my homework, I was never happy. A new lesson every day was also a challenge. I had to be patient and take my time. I had to be patient and take my time. One day my teacher gave us an easy lesson and I was confident that I could finish it in school. I would come up with a difficult problem every now and then and get stressed out. But I remembered what my mother said, "Be patient and calm rest" @ CAPS2 I did. I was patient and solved the problem. Even today, I remember being patient. I also remember what it will take for us to be patient all of our lives. Math is what helped me become a more patient person inside and out.
This time my brother and I were returning from @ LOCATION1. Everything was fine until the car broke down in the clear lane. So we called our parents to come and pick us up. Now, when they got over there, they forgot the cabolons. So just as they came up to us, they left. So @ NUM1 hours have passed hearing that they are coming. I said you remembered to have everything. They shook their heads yes plugged in the car and a path we went.
Once @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 was sitting watching TV and having fun when his brother, or his brother-in-law @ PERSON1 walked into the room and said "@ CAPS2 we have to go to my interview, or you are going to be to fail, ?? “ @ CAPS3 is long, ” @ CAPS2 said, “ about an hour, ” @ PERSON1 replied. But the itches and scrapes are going to be on, and that's only once, "said @ CAPS2," @ CAPS6 that useless kidshow, dude that was on the @ CAPS7 and then they made it a real show ". Where is he, ”@ CAPS2 said. It's @ ORGANIZATION1, @ CAPS6 and the man @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 @ CAPS2 get there, we're leaving in an hour okay, so do a science experiment or something, "@ PERSON1 said, @ CAPS2 didn't never liked the man @ CAPS9- @ CAPS13, after the commercial he was at @ DATE1, which I won't say what happened. @ CAPS2 did what he does best to do a science experiment to plan his revenge on the man @ CAPS9- @ CAPS13 or anyone he doesn't like. So he waited @ NUM1 minutes for the experiment to be over. Then they left, it was three hours away. road, and his favorite show was playing, he recorded it. He was patient, then they got there. He looked for the man @ CAPS9- @ CAPS10 for @ NUM2 minutes, @ PERSON1 could he lie to him, he was so patient he got tired, then fell asleep, woke up and guessed who it was. Man @ CAPS9- @ CAPS10, remember me "@ CAPS2 said dude @ CAPS9- @ CAPS10 , @ PERSON1 has looked and laughed, @ CAPS2 threw a good ball in the @ CAPS9- @ CAPS10, @ DATE2, over @ CAPS9 - @ CAPS10 male. @ CAPS2 has been patient, he has been patient for over @ NUM3 hours to be able to look itchy and almost @ DATE2 @ DATE1 to get back to the man @ CAPS9- @ CAPS10. The end.
Usually I have very little patience (and yes I know patience is a virtue), but on my birthday a few years ago I had to stay in a hospital room with any dad to hang out with my mom, @ CAPS1 was very boring, but somehow I managed to get through the whole day (until where my dad finally left me looking @ CAPS2.V. in the room) without having tears in my eyes.
A time when I was patient. I used to go shopping at school. There were maybe over a hundred people in the @ PERSON1 store. It was like a duster of pebbles in the sand. You could hardly get off. The islands. It was like an entire mall in a small store. Some people would leave because how many people were in there. Then even more would come. It was me, @ CAPS1 mom and @ CAPS1 dad. We started things. We've lined up behind maybe @ NUM1 or more people. @ CAPS1 mom was ready to explode. So @ TIME1 only people @ TIME1 were gone. @ CAPS1 mom almost fell asleep, I was just there waiting. But @ CAPS1's armies were wounded and @ CAPS1 backed off. She was so ready to step out of this store. @ CAPS1 dad was reading a magizene while he waited. Espn news to be exact. It was only a few people in front of the use. I was glad we could finally get clothes @ CAPS1. We get up by the clothes @ CAPS1 and a cash register braeks. The lady said it would take an hour or two for @ CAPS1's mom to start complaining. We stood in line for an hour and a half to make this happen. "@ CAPS1 dad was ok with that because he was so in this magizene I couldn't believe it had happened, I was so disappointed I was ready just like @ CAPS1 mum so mum so we had @ CAPS1 daddy and left. @ CAPS1 dad said ““ I'm in the good part. ”I didn't get the clothes that day but we went to get them a new week.
I was skating when we were on the bus, we had just arrived at school, the kids were loud and noisy during the day. There was a lot to get off the bus when someone jumped in front ??? then I fell back into my seat, there were about @ NUM1 - @ DATE1 the kids were getting off the bus. So I waited for all the kids to pass me, then I got up and took the alie down to the door, then the bus driver said "thank you for waiting". Then i left
It was @ DATE1, @ CAPS1, my friends were talking about the coolness of the Xbox. They said if you get Xbox live you can play with people all over the world. They were also talking about the new game that was about to be released, which was called @ CAPS2 from @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ NUM1. I had searched for it online. And it was voted to be a star rating @ NUM2. Now it's a good game. I had asked my mom and dad if I could get it. They both say and always will see. After another month I had asked my mom again and she told me why don't you wait @ CAPS6. And once I went to my dad's house he said @ CAPS6 was just around the corner. But I said everybody has it, I can't have it now. My dad said no so after that I waited @ NUM1 months thinking he might have his answer or maybe he had changed his answer. And again he said no. So I went to my mom's house and asked her, she said I should be able to wait and she also said if I asked for more I wouldn't have it. And so @ CAPS6 came along and for my last present from my mom and dad i got xbox with my favorite game i was so happy. And know that I know that if you are a pacifist and wait long enough, you will get what you want.
I am always patient. But do you know when and where I'm really patient? It's when I get my hair cut. Every time I go for a haircut there are a lot of people in the @ CAPS1 store. So people say they have to go, some were for a party or for church and they need a haircut right away. So I let them cut and I have to wait and be patient. It makes me a little happy to be patient because I help others and if I need someone to be very patient with me, I want them to be patient.
It's about a time when I was patent, first I was keeping my cozin. The names are @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS1, they must have been hidden as the adelts were rearranging things upstairs so we sat downstairs. Nexzeke @ PERSON1 and I watched a movie. They called me tiches two they didn't sit still it took a long time not to yell at them to sit down and watch the movie. It was early and I want to play with @ CAPS1 who was sitting in her crib. Finally, they were almost done upstairs. The couch has been moved and the shit. So it was more spacious upstairs that was when I was small.
I was patient when I went to ceder point @ CAPS1 I used is that I was playing a video game. As I was packing, I grabbed my psp which I put in my bag. So I was half bored ??? there so i grabbed my psp and ??? so I lost track of ???. Like us ??? my daughters did it and we ??? when we got to the hostel we were so close to the park but as soon as i got there i ??? long my patience. We stood in line, we sat forever so I was playing on my psp. The psp helped me to be patient. I??? My psp to help. It would have been hard but my psp is testing my mind ???
Patience is generally good or bad for me. Here are some reasons why patience can be difficult or stressful. If you are waiting to receive an injection or life threatening results. One way to avoid normal patience, like being on board, is to have notes or homework or an ipod. Patience is everywhere. For example, cars, birthday parties, vacation advertisements, leaving school, restaurants, vacations, or whenever you say " I can't wait " and so on.
A time when I was patient was when I was waiting for my brother at the dentist. My brother's name is @ CAPS1 and he's sixteen. One day we went to the dentist. My brother must have had his wisdom teeth pulled out. My grandma and @ CAPS2 have been waiting for hours. After a while she went into the back room with my brother. So I was sitting alone in the waiting room. Luckily I had my @ CAPS3 so I watched some cartoons and listened to some music. A few minutes later, I went to the bathroom. When I left, a nurse told me to come with her, she led me into the back room with my brother and my grandmother. I learned that the doctor hadn't even started yet! At least I could talk to my brother. So, for what seemed like days, the doctor finally showed up. After about an hour, the operation was complete. Then we had to sit down and wait for the amnesia to go away. My brother was acting crazy and crazy. It was really funny. Finally we left and I did not lose patience.
When I was really patient when I wanted my mom and dad to cook me lazuge. I haven't had any because my death is @ DATE1. My mom had my @ CAPS1 to cook @ CAPS2 on my first birthday. when she cooked some for my first birthday party, it was all gone. My mom @ CAPS3 cooked @ NUM1 casseroles. It was so good it was gone as soon as she turned it off when I say soon I mean soon. I was @ NUM2 years old. My mom made it big for my birthday party. My mother died of an open heart twill. She was @ NUM3 years old. She had viola friends at her furnal. The furnal was very nice. But getting back to what I was writing about, so at @ DATE2 I asked my @ CAPS1. To cook for me. She told me it was too expensive to do it. I said @ CAPS1 would you like me to give you money to cook food, for me. She said no, keep what little money you have. I said but @ CAPS1 it's good to take my money to buy my lazangae and cook it for me. She said girl what did I say. So I hurry and put my money in my pocket. Then I kept it moving. When we got in the truck she said now @ CAPS5 I'm going to cook it for when I have some more money and when I pay my bills. At @ DATE3, she cooked it for me. The day she cooked it for me, it was @ CAPS6 @ NUM4, @ DATE3. My antyes came to have them, my brother and my sister had them, and my @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS8 had them. When they all wanted it, I would stand there and watch them get it, and when to stop getting it. Selfer when my @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS8 have them. I didn't tell them when it was downstairs because I live in their house. My brother and sister live with them. The lanag only lasted @ NUM5 days and that. When she cooked it, I was happy. I brought it to school and ate it for my lunch.
One time I was patient was when I was at the end of the year in fourth grade and had just signed up for football. I made @ DATE1 wait from @ DATE1. When I got my soccer pads I was so excited for soccer I put them on about four times before the soccer started. @ DATE1 passed and it was @ DATE2. In @ DATE2 I am showing cows, which made @ DATE2 go very quickly. Finally it was @ DATE1. I only kept waiting eleven days @ DATE1 until the day of my first practice. When the day came, it went by super quickly and six o'clock arrived quickly. Then it was time for @ DATE1 to go. I loved football that year and have been playing football ever since. It took patience @ DATE1 to wait for football. Two months @ MONTH1 doesn't seem long, but for a ten year old it's hard @ DATE1 to wait that long.
The moment I had to be patient was when my brother was going to give me a present when it wasn't even my birthday yet. This is how this whole story began. It was a hot day @ DATE1 and I had done my household chores including racking, mowing and many other gardening jobs. Mom, dad and my brother Travis talked a lot. When I was just sitting down the stairs they would tell me to go do my chores so I could see them talking. It bothered me a lot that I couldn't hear what they were saying. I finally kept doing my chores and just finished mowing the witch took two hours and went inside and started watching TV when all of a sudden I hear "click click tap bam ", then I heard a sudden cry from my brother Travis saying" Hey come back here ", I went to our fourteen looped stairs and all of a sudden I was greeted by the licking of a six month old puppy. I grabbed his collar laughing and saw his name was max and he is now a happy three year old pooch and it was my brothers who introduced me to have it all. Like and do a lot of work around the house. I love my dog but this was the time I had to be patient
I once waited for the game but I haven't been able to get it yet. So I asked my mom if she could buy me a new game, how much does it cost? @ NUM1 dollars then she said you had to wait a few days the @ NUM2 came by then I finally asked my mom if she could buy for me she said okay again. I said thank you. Then the next morning we went to the game store, then I saw the game I wanted, told my mom we went to the counter and bought my game.
The doctor's appointment. Oct @ NUM1 @ DATE1 my mom and I were getting ready to go to the doctor. Once we got them it was so busy. I felt like we had been theirs for weeks, even @ CAPS1 there were a lot of kids crying and playing. I was so exhausted that I was still waiting my turn to see the doctor @ NUM2 minutes later still not my turn I was trying my best to be patient but it didn't help at all with all the noise from the kids that were running everywhere? ??. I walked over to the register and that's where I found out my date I want until @ NUM3 hours and it was only @ NUM4.
One day my dad and I had a doctor's appointment at @ NUM1 pm so we got there on time. Then my dad and I just sat there for a while. We thought it would take a few more minutes. So we waited @ NUM2 minutes. Then my dad went to ask other doctors how long it was going to take. The doctors said about @ NUM2 more minutes, so we waited @ NUM2 more minutes. The doctor still hasn't come out. We waited @ NUM5 minutes. My father went to the doctor again. They said a few more minutes we waited @ NUM2 more minutes there the doctor called us. So the doctor was @ NUM7 minutes late. When we entered the room the doctor said sorry! because he was late. This is how my father and I were patient.
Being patient is a difficult task. One day I was with my mom at @ LOCATION1, looking for a pawnshop. We stopped at almost every red light on the way. No one complained even when we hit a certain red light. Just before the light turned very green an old lady with a walker showed up in front of us, we waited NUM1 minutes for the old lady to pass. Supersing still no one complained.
When you hear the word patience, what do you think of? I think of a person standing in line in a store when there are @ NUM1 people in front of you. At the @ NUM2 level, my sister and I played the patient game. It was about who could go the longest without food and all you could drink was water and the winner was given a whole box of Dunkin donuts for themselves. Day @ NUM3 I had about @ NUM4 water bottles but my sister was still hooked in there. Day @ NUM5 I had about @ NUM6 bottles of water and all day my stomach moaned with my sister. Day @ NUM7 all the moans and growls my sister was hanging out and so ??? was ??? their I drink water. Day @ NUM8 I broke and had so much food all my police were gone my sister @ CAPS1 was clapping and she said "don't worry, let you have one of my @ NUM9 chocolate donuts" and she kept her word. In my opinion, it was patience.
One of the worst cases in the world is that your flight has been canceled. It has happened to a lot of people but only one family in my family. My cousins were coming to @ LOCATION1 for Christmas. Cara and I were texting and emailing each other about what to do while they were at @ LOCATION1. They've been planning this since @ DATE1, but now their night is over ! We were so crazy! The family of my cousins had to be so patient because they do not know if they would come to see us or not. My grandma kept calling my uncle @ LOCATION2. My grandmother had a great idea for them! To participate in the next fight. The only problem was that the next flight was at @ NUM1 and it would take them two hours to get here. When they got here, I was at the airport waiting. When I saw my cousin she said "everyone was so patient except me!" I expected the exact opposite but no! I thought my cousin Carn would be the patient but I was wrong, but at least someone was patient.
One time I was patient was when my dad and I went to leslie's place to go hunting we wake up to @ TIME1 @ TIME3 and get there @ TIME1 @ TIME4. We stayed there until @ TIME1 and then we left. When we were there my dad pulled a doe @ TIME1 @ NUM1 in the merking. He bypassed another @ TIME1 doe about @ NUM2 in the @ TIME2, so we left with two big does in the back of my dad's truck. It was a time when I was very patient.
Once I was patient when I went to the dentist. When I went to the dentist I had to be patient because when we had their appointment we were checked in and there were a lot of people there so we had to wait a long time. When I was waiting I was sitting on the floor really boarding. I kept asking my mom if it was almost my turn and she kept saying she didn't know. Finally, the doctor called my name. So I walked in then the nurse prepared me for the real doctor, then when she was done I had to wait even longer for my dentist to come because he was working with another patient but then he finally came so I had finished ! It was a time when I had to be really patient.
Patience Someone was patient with me when I didn't understand something. Someone was a teacher. The teacher didn't complain about helping me. With the students in the room. When the teacher was helping me, they would sit and work quietly. The teacher understands that I didn't understand @ CAPS1 to do the job. It was during math. We were talking about positive and negative interactions . My question was: '' @ CAPS1 do you order them from the last to the biggest ''. She said, “Would you like me to show you?” I said, “@ CAPS2 please”. So for about @ NUM1 minutes she helped me out. During this time, my whole class was sitting and working on it. It was a time when people were patient with me.
Where to start, there never was. A time when I was patient. I've always pushed people to do something and got angry because they weren't doing it fast enough or going fast enough for me. I would just have an attitude. This is why I cannot be patient and now you know why. The end. The teaching on how people come ie ???.
Melt @ CAPS1 ! I experienced this @ CAPS2 scene when I was in class @ NUM1 at Cross Creeds Christm School. It was @ DATE1 and we lived just around the corner. @ CAPS3 @ NUM2 minutes my patients were kinda almost to my mom not there and @ CAPS3 @ NUM3 minutes later I got angry tantrism and cried and my patients were like a newsletter ballot that erupted and slowly lowered as I grew angrier and. More angry with the fast, my mother was not there yet. This ake mast will happen to me @ CAPS4. I made the chosen rong to get mad at something usaasly stupid redic . Learn from my words, as @ CAPS4 I give up trying to keep trying.
I'm going to tell you about a time when I was patient. When my family and mom boyfriend on vacation at @ ORGANIZATION1. When we got there it was full of people. So we lined up for the first round. We were so excited that @ PERSON2 said @ NUM1 teen twink wait. At the beginning, the line moved very quickly. There, all of a sudden, things move like a sloth. It was so hot and humid it was alful. We have already checked what time it was @ NUM2 twink. It was like @ NUM3 hours. I was running out of pashents. Then we took the shade, it was cool and pleasant. Finiy we were the next storage room we got out on and a nice one. @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS1 where so happy. My boyfriend mom timed the ride it only lasted @ NUM4 seconds. We waited @ NUM5 hour for a @ NUM4 second rid. It was once that I had to wait.
Patience is something that you need to go through your day to day life. Having patience means that you are understanding and tolerant. Most people don't have a lot, but others do. Like my brother, @ CAPS4 has it but not many. There are five children in my family; @ NUM1 girls, @ NUM2 boys. I'm not gonna lie, but I'm boring @ CAPS1 sometimes. My little sisters and brother are @ CAPS1 obnoxious. But; my older brother is the most obnoxious of them @ CAPS3 ! @ CAPS4 is the one who freaks out about every little thing we say or do. But this time, I don't know what got into him. It was going to be interesting. We were sitting at home @ CAPS2 once, and my big bottle was a patient @ CAPS1, when we amazed him, @ CAPS4 usually grated his fists. So my sisters, brother and I continued to fight and miss with my brother. We would tell him to shut up or even slap him in the morning. Still, @ CAPS4 would stay there as if there was nothing wrong. @ CAPS4 would usually beat my location and I if we usually fought then we would adapt, but this time @ CAPS4 didn't care @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 ! I was serious when I started to worry because it wasn't like him. So I got up and slapped him on the face with my fingers slipping off his check, leaving bb's face red with a four finger mask @ CAPS4 has been @ CAPS1 a patient since we started to be boring. But I think @ CAPS2 at this point I cut the thread to call it nice. @ CAPS4 stood up, left wide open for a slap. Before I knew it, I was on the floor crying. I ran to tell my father. Oh, did I mention I'm daddy's little girl? I think you could have understood that my brother was the one who had problems @ CAPS4 had so much patience being tolerant during @ CAPS3 these things, well, @ CAPS2 on and, @ CAPS4 was cracked by my dad, and so do my fingers. @ CAPS2 at least I've never had any trouble. This is when daddy's little girl comes in handy!
When I'm patient, it's mostly in the woods. This is when I hunt. You have to be patient to wait for the deer. They don't always come sometimes, maybe it's just a fawn. Other times it may be. put when you see a dollar ??? is all you need to first wait for it to get close enough for a shot. When it does, you have to wait to take out your gun. Then you have to wait for a hit. If you get him, be patient and wait for him to die. If you can't find it right away, don't give up. It was then that I was patient.
My volleyball team once went to @ ORGANIZATION1. I was one of the last people to get off our bus which meant I was one of the last to order. I stayed there very patiently as everyone ordered. I talked to my friends while they were also waiting. Then I figured out what I was going to eat, (cheese @ CAPS1, hamburger, fries @ CAPS2 and a large drink). "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4, @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4" As I looked at the clock my eyes went droopy "@ CAPS7, @ NUM1," the lady said. “@ CAPS8 @ MONTH1 I'm taking your order,” she said. I told her what I wanted and she put it on her ledger and started to wait. A few minutes later, I received my order. Finally, after being patient, I got my food. It was the time when I was patient at @ ORGANIZATION1 ???
People with patients are great teachers, my mom is one of those great leaders, she has a lot of patients, she has a family and a lot of responsibilities. When we ask things over and over again she doesn't get angry and she just says no or yes to you @ MONTH1 with a smile or when she comes home from a long day at work. She never complains, she just keeps a smile on her face and ends the rest of the day with adventures. When she wakes up in the morning to take us to school, she has a bright smile on her face and she never complains. My mother is a very patient woman and a great teacher and leader. I appreciate everything she does for me, my brother and my dad.
When I had to be patient, that was when I wanted a psp. So there was a time when I wanted a psp so badly so I asked my parents they told me I had to wait until @ CAPS1. But I really wanted it but decided to wait a long time and finally got a psp.
I remember I had to use the old sisters phone @ CAPS10. The pearl @ CAPS1. @ CAPS2 was really slow @ CAPS2 dropped calls, and I was @ CAPS3 awful. @ CAPS10's birthday was approaching and I really needed it. and I asked @ CAPS10 mom @ CAPS4 that I was going to have one for @ CAPS10's birthday. She said, “@ CAPS5. Be patient.” And I really wanted to know, so I kept asking her, and she said no. But I didn't give up. I was very patient. until @ CAPS10's birthday. When I woke up I saw gifts on the kitchen table! The @ CAPS10 family watched me open them. When I had one left, I opened @ CAPS2. I was a huge box! and I opened @ CAPS2 to find another box. and another and another, and another. Finally @ CAPS2 was at the smallest. I wrote @ CAPS2 and the side of the box said iphone on @ CAPS2 !! I have an iphone @ NUM1! I was so happy! ”@ CAPS9 what you get for being patient.” @ CAPS10 mom said with a smile.
Patient once, I was patient, I was really patient. I was invited to sleep and when I went to sleep. So when I got there when I went to the tower to have an unreadable pop in
What is the patient? Being patient means waiting for something @ MONTH1 takes a long time but you understand and wait without being rude. An example is your expectation of a toy that has just been released. Everyone has it and it's the coolest toy in town. The problem is, your mom and dad can't afford it right now. When you understand that money is struggling and you don't start with the side of mothers begging for the toy every day, you are patient. If you do this then you are not patient and your mother is going to tell you, " Stop being patient." be patient.
I am writing a story about patience. Patience in can say that I am waiting for you to be done with whatever you are doing. Something like the o, let's say @ CAPS1 was waiting for the kids to be calm. And they can't, even though she gets annoyed, she's still patient with us instead of saying come out of my class giving us chance after chance. Because she wants us to be good and to stay in class.
I know someone who is much more patient than I am! This person is my sister. My sister is the most patient person you will meet. I am not patient at all. First of all, when I went somewhere, my sister would sit right there. I would say what can we leave now. My sister is always patient ! That’s why I think she’s patient.
One rainy afternoon on @ DATE1, the mother of my little brother's friends called and needed me to babysit. She and my mom were going soon and @ CAPS1 would be back until 9pm so she needed me to come. So my mom moved me there and dropped me off at 7pm after a brief entry on what to do in an emergency. When they left me and the kids wrestled and watched @ CAPS1.v. We ran, we talked (mostly they tackled me) and I lifted them upside down, then with a slight thirst to put them to bed and cover them twice each time. After they brushed their teeth and went to bed, they went there twice to read my book. I really sighed and turned on the @ CAPS1. v need a patience collar fear coz my mm to get me back.
There is a time in everyone's life when you have to be patient. The time I was patient was when I was helping my brother learn to tie his shoes. I know it sounds like an easy task, but it really isn't. Time and time again my brother tried to tie his shoes but never could. So I told him to go get one of his shoes and I'll teach him. When we started I thought it would be over in about five minutes, but no! He couldn't do the bunny ears. So we tried and tried again. He got so close to tying the knot, then he got so excited that he pulled the knot as hard as he could and the laces fell to the floor. I really wanted to give up and let him use his strappy shoes but no, he was determined to tie his shoes. After about an hour of tying, he finally got it! He didn't tie them up perfectly but it was good enough to keep them tied. I said good job and started walking to the kitchen. When he asked about the double knot. So of course, I walk over and tell him to cross the two bunny ears and make a loop, but he didn't understand. I must have shown him a billion times how! But he still hasn't understood. We reach the half hour ??? for the double ??? and I went into the kitchen for a box of juice. When he returned, my brother had a smile on his cheek and proudly waved his shoe.
At the time, I was very patient when I had to do a bird project, which included a life-scale model. On the model, I had to glue parts every day. But the glue took @ NUM1 hours to dry. So I had to redo it three times, which made it a @ NUM2 day project instead of seven. I worked harder than @ ORGANIZATION1, but kept holding back my wonderful creation. The wings were breaking and I had to patiently glue them back on. I finally finished it, although it took a lot longer than I wanted. I used paint, caution and a steady hand to finally succeed !
A time when I was patient was while I was with my mom and she decided to 'make cooks' so we made all the cooks ready. They looked so good even though they weren't cooked. My mother just ??? go in the oven for @ NUM1 twinks! I didn't want to wait that long for my cookies. As they started to take the shape of a big dark brown, round and soft, my pout was lost, I wanted them now. The timer rang @ CAPS1 over there, grabbed a heating pad and almost took them out of the oven ! Just when I was about to have one, my mom shouted "they need to calm down". She set the timer for @ NUM2 twinks ! I didn't think I could wait that long. My magnet is watering the little one. I was dying, I wanted them so badly! I thought the smell could kill me! Each twink seemed to be an hour old. Then the timer went off, I sprinted, over there I grabbed a plate thrown @ NUM3 from the biggest cooks on the plate, while burning my hand. But I didn't care I took a bite out of a cooke my water was finished. My pies paid off in the end, I was so aware of the cooks I had.
School. At school, you have to be patient. The day you run out of patients. You would be trying to tolerate you patients. Most of the day it will be fun. Maye, if you take it, you'll be cool and be patient. But patient is something I do when it comes to ??? lunch and the bathroom. Seeing every day a duty to tolerate people who go to the bathroom when they have to go, I have to wait @ CAPS1 I'm starting to get hungry. I need lunch, I have to wait for this. Once I eat I have to be patient for the gym. I have to be patient every day of the week. I have to put up with all of this every week. The end goodbye.
I was patient once, it was in @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. Guess @ CAPS3 from @ NUM1 !) @ CAPS4 was the @ DATE1. When we pulled up to the tickit booth, the man in the small booth said "tickit please." @ CAPS5, we stopped to get a parking space. I did when we got out and ran for the gates. But at that point, @ CAPS8's sister forgot her briefcase. @ CAPS5 I went back to the truck and got @ CAPS4. Then we entered our bathrooms. Then we went to the water. The first ride I did was the "@ CAPS6 from @ CAPS7!" @ MONTH1 Disturbing you @ CAPS4 was very scary. But I said, "When does anyone want to come with me?" @ CAPS8 dad & @ CAPS8 friend from work moms said yes! @ CAPS5, we have entered the queue. The line was like @ NUM2 to @ NUM3 people in the line. @ CAPS5 the wait was about @ NUM4 hours ! But I didn't complain at all. But then we heard a bloody scream coming from the ride. Then a man, women and @ NUM4 young children were spat into the pool. Then we took their tube and went up the stairs. We approached the huge opening where you could see the drop off of @ NUM6 and then the pink and yellow British funnle. About @ NUM7 minutes later we were at the port where you get on your metro. @ CAPS5 we went down. @ CAPS8 moms friend (@ PERSON1) fell upside down. I said "yes", you're going to go back down. Alla ! @ CAPS5 we started to descend then fell (well, we fell in free fall) but we were going NUM8 mph. @ CAPS4 was scary. Then we sat down. Then I fell into the pool and walked out. I watch @ CAPS8 mom and I was two sisters. They laughed at @ PERSON1 for crying. Then she said she wasn't feeling well. @ CAPS5, she went to the truck and took a nap. Then I walked through the rest of @ TIME1. It was a time when I was patient.
One time I was patient was when I went to the mall. "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2" I told whoever was behind me my mom and I had come to the mall to buy some clothes @ DATE1. This mall was packed. No one could get in where I was getting so patient. The eternal was to understand and it was this white family that was passing by and they all jostled me. I was so patient while waiting in one. I was just ready to leave everyone when our time finally came. It was the time when I was patient. I was so proud of myself that I held on to in. The @ CAPS3.
A mother bird was laying eggs. She laid @ NUM1 perfect perfect blue eggs. Days have passed and the eggs have not hatched. The mother bird got angry. She talked to daddy bird and he said, "@ CAPS1 be patient". More weeks went by and the mother bird got worse. Again, the bird daddy said to be patient. In her free time, the mother bird kept busy turning her wing a, shopping, cooking, cleaning but nothing could make her forget the eggs. Months passed. The years have passed. Decades, centuries and millennia have passed! But the mother bird was always patient. Finally, one day the eggs cracked, and she was so happy. Almost immediately, @ NUM2's oldest birds took off in flight. The third one asked "@ CAPS2 I can't fly yet" and mom said, "@ CAPS1 be patient."
I was @ CAPS1 delighted to have my first iPad. But, there was a very long line. @ CAPS1, my mom kept telling her to be patient. @ CAPS1, I stay there quietly. Then when we got closer, I couldn't wait. Finally, we have come to the start of the line. When, I got up there, my dad said " what kind do you want ? » @ CAPS1 I told him I wanted the big one. Therefore, we had and put a lot of cool songs there. After that we got home and I listened to it all day. Then I said " stop listening to this music " @ CAPS1, I left it for about @ NUM1 hours. Then it was time to eat my dinner. After that, we drove in my daddy's new car. Finally, we got home. I put away everything I bought at the store. Then I watched TV and ate popcorn. Then it was time for me to go to bed. It was then that I was patient.
When I was patient we were one way back to point @ CAPS1 : with @ LOCATION1 her mom and dad and brother and me. We were driving to get there. It took us @ NUM1 hours to get there. @ LOCATION1 and I were very patient, we waited and waited to get there, we were so excited. When we got there we all lined up to ride a bunch of roller coasters. We all stood in line about @ NUM2 hours for each ride, it was very busy that day. @ LOCATION1 and I wanted to ride the tallest roller coaster. It was called @ CAPS2 the @ CAPS2 was @ NUM1 @ NUM4 it was the highest rollercoster. I had been there before and all the other people who have been there too. To get on this route, we had to wait @ NUM5 hours, it was exosting and we had to be very patient. But when we got to the front it was worth the wait!
Click ", ok, great grandma thank you." I say "your welcome". @ CAPS1 says. " When will they be here ? " I said. "I do not know." @ CAPS2 you don't know what @ CAPS3 is talking about, what you probably don't know, @ CAPS3 is talking about my shoes that I just ordered online. He called @ CAPS4. And boy, I was going crazy because of these things. I waited @ NUM1 days and every day I would ask my mom if they are still there, are they still there but every time I did they weren't there. I was starting to get angry. So finally I rode my bike to take my mind off and saw a truck @ ORGANIZATION1 and thought yes it was probably going to my house with my shoes on so I ran over to my house and I waited, waited but still no shoes. So the next day I searched online for where my shoes were, and it said @ PERSON1. MID. I was freaking out, that meant they were coming. So again @ CAPS3 just wait and wait and my mom decided to go somewhere. So I got in the car to leave, and thought I heard the truck, but no so we finally got back to my house and looked left and yeah! there they were sitting on my forehead ?? in a rough brown box. I run to pick it up and rush inside to open it and there are the best shoes known to man. I try them on (@ CAPS6) they are awesome. I thank my grandmother and all my patients are gone. I felt so happy.
One time I had to be patient was at Cedar Point at @ LOCATION1. My @ CAPS1, sister and a friend were spending the night at Cedar Point. My @ CAPS1s stayed at the RV while my @ CAPS1s, my sister and I spent the evening riding a roller coaster. After about six hours my sister and I went on all the roller coasters except @ NUM1 or @ NUM2, my @ CAPS1 by the way, are not really like a roller coaster, being old and all so it was really just my sister and I. So after all the fun my sister and my @ CAPS1 were going back to the RV but wanted to continue ??? before I got home so i asked if she could ask she said yes. I told my @ CAPS1 that I would be back in half an hour, hopefully. The roller coaster was the second largest roller coaster in the park. As I stood in line I felt like it would take forever. I have @ CAPS2, so as you can imagine I could barely stand still, had to try really hard but eventually got back on the path, and then it was good again. The passing ride was extremely amazing.
@ PERSON1. I was in love with the guy! I swear college @ CAPS1 when you have to be the most patient ever in your life ! Seconds pass like hours in which your lessons feel like they are going on for centuries, which can sometimes be good, like in the humanities. Social studies is the only class I have with @ PERSON1 and I sit behind him looking at his perfect face. @ DATE2 @ CAPS1 the girl's dance of choice and I was determined to go with @ PERSON1. So in social studies, I wrote him a note. "@ PERSON1, love you very much and was wondering if you wanted to go to the girls' choice dance with me? From @ ORGANIZATION1." I chickened out I couldn't give it to her myself so I devised a plan. I told @ LOCATION1 who said @ PERSON2 to @ CAPS3 @ PERSON3 (who @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1's friend) to @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2 ((@ PERSON1's best friend) 's best friend at @ CAPS3 @ PERSON1 I liked him. Rumors spread quickly in college, so @ PERSON1 found out before @ PERSON2 but, now he knows it , and now it's @ DATE1 and social studies time. Patience @ CAPS1 my essence I remember not being too quick to knock. Well, I definitely wasn't because the bell rang before that I can give him the note. I waited and waited patiently until the right moment, finally I leaned down and handed my note to @ PERSON1. He opened it and waited for a response, and waited, and waited. I think I could be a little patient seeing today @ CAPS1 @ DATE2 and dancing @ CAPS1 tonight. To my locker, which @ CAPS1 four and a door down @ PE RSON1, I have a note pasted on it. It reads "@ CAPS3 me your phone number and I will call you for @ NUM1.". My God ! The boys are so confusing that I @ CAPS3 him my number and I wait by the phone. I think he's testing my patience. I wait what seems like hours before my phone rings. I wanted to break down, give up, then a surge of willpower would come back and @ CAPS3 me, it would be worth it in the end. The phone didn't ring for what seemed like forever, so when it finally did, I thought I was imagining it. When I answered, all my patience paid off! He said a word. Yes!
Have you ever wanted to do something and your parents said “@ CAPS1 be patient? Recently @ CAPS2 has been patient. My family got a new microwave and it's too big for our counter, so we had to put it on top of our stove. Well there wasn't enough space above the stove so my parents decided to redo the whole kitchen. My mother-in-law took it all out of the kitchen and put it all over the dining room, and now we can barely walk into the dining room. Lately my family ate in our living room. (@ CAPS3) I really don't like to eat in our living room, @ CAPS1 looks so gross. But we also have the option of eating outside on our veranda. So that's a good thing. I don't know how long I can go on with this. But @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 must be patient. Finally, now my dad has made a new shelf and he can set up our new microwave, finish painting and put our stove back in place. After he did, my mother-in-law put all our seasonings and other stuff aside and how we got back to normal. After being patient, it really pays off. Now you know to always be patient.
It was a beautiful sunny day @ DATE1 !!! We decided we could pick up everyone from my dad and go to the Genesee County farm. We arrived at my father's house and picked up my brother-in-law, my sister-in-law, my real brother, my mother-in-law and my father. We start heading towards the Genesee County Farm. We started to walk around waiting to see if it was going to rain. If it were to rain, it would be a waste of money. We go up to the ticket office to see if we could come back tomorrow with the same bracelets if it starts to rain. They said no so we decided to stand there and wait a little longer and then it starts to rain. We had to go and sit in this metal barn until the rain stopped. During this time, the barn begins to be flooded. Then we get phone calls saying the tornadoes just hit a few miles away. Finally, it has stopped raining and we all head outside. We waited for the rides to resume. Once they finally started again, the rain started again. So we all ran to the car. We were soaked. We decided to stop trying at the fair and do something else. Instead, we all went out and ate a toco cloche and a burger tong.
One day my grandfather and I went fishing, my grandfather always says that it is important to always wait. When we got to our fishing area, I said I wanted to catch a turtle and my grandfather said, “ It's gonna take a long time, just catch fish ”. I told him I was going to catch a turtle and it was final. When something pulled on my fishing rod, I used to soil to pull it and what pulled my line was a little white bass. The next thing that pulled my fishing rod was a big white bass. I got annoyed because there weren't any turtles biting my line. The next thing that pulled on my line was a @ NUM1 inch white bass, it was the biggest fish I have ever caught before, but it wasn't a turtle. After I caught this fish I said it was time to take a break. I was having a sandwich and my grandpa was jerking off and catching fish. At the time I was finishing my sandwich and my fishing rod was pulling. I had to grab my fishing rod and ??? in my fish but it was not a fish it was a baby turtle.
At college @ CAPS1, in @ PERSON2's dirty and muddy science class, a boy named @ CAPS2 and another named @ CAPS3 were cleaning up the mess @ CAPS7 had made earlier from their mudball fight. For years @ PERSON2 has been trying to @ CAPS6 patient with the twins, trying to @ CAPS6 patient with the twins, trying to figure out what might calm them down. @ CAPS7 has done @ CAPS4… @ CAPS5 @ PERSON2. Often times she would wonder what went through their minds when @ CAPS7 got angry. Teaching them science, @ CAPS7 never understood. When @ CAPS7 did things wrong, @ CAPS7 didn't know it was wrong. @ CAPS7 has progressed @ CAPS8 through @ CAPS8 in his class, understanding little. But it was as the manager said : "@ CAPS6 patient, @ PERSON1 ; @ CAPS7 will learn eventually." @ CAPS8 by @ CAPS8 Over the months, @ PERSON1 believed more and more her husband. By being patient with them and not getting mad at them when @ CAPS7 did something wrong their grades quickly started to improve, by the end of the year @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS2 were students of @ CAPS11-plus. @ CAPS7 had passed the @ PERSON1 course. On the last day of school, @ PERSON1 went to her husband's office. She @ CAPS12 told him that his advice was working and that he was a great manager. All @ PERSON3 replied was "@ CAPS12 so you!"
I am patient. Although I hate being patient, I can usually tolerate it. Like when I was @ NUM1 and there was no school due to so much snow my mom had to go to an out of town meeting so she took me to my dad house. She forgot that he had to work @ DATE1 from @ NUM2 am to @ NUM3 pm. It was too late. I had to go to work with my father. He was and still is the director of Autozone. So I stayed in this little office (which I add @ MONTH1 never changed, even @ NUM4 years later.) And was going to have to be patient. REALLY patient. My mom had brought this doodle thing so I could draw, which only kept me busy for an hour. Then I had to walk around doing nothing. that's until I find @ NUM5 employees doing inventory. Hehe, they had these carts that had a top surface and a bottom surface. I grabbed hold of the undersurface and held on. They pushed me into the store without even knowing it! I did this for about @ NUM5 hours and still had almost @ NUM1 hours to kill. I found this old coloring book lying in the girls bathroom. If it was me now, @ CAPS1 would have hit it. But I did. I was only @ NUM1 ! I don't really remember everything I did after that, but I know it was so boring because it's implanted in my brain. Is there ever a time when patience is fun ??
Being patient is very difficult. I was at the store with my mom, and of course @ CAPS1 has bonded forever. “Come on mom, let's go, do we really need this stuff” @ CAPS1 continued shopping. Grrr I was so angry. I almost thought of going through a crisis. Finally, we were online. As we got in the car, my mom looked at me and told me to give me your phone. " @ CAPS2 why " ? The way you reacted in that store was horrible now, no I will always be patient with my mom.
Every year, I go to my fathers. He lives at @ LOCATION1 so we stop at the border. The border takes @ CAPS1 ! My family must therefore be patient with them. On our way @ LOCATION1 once the border was packed. Our family had to be patient, otherwise there would be arguments. With four children, this is bound to happen. After an hour all the patients were running out of patients, so my dad kept saying, "Stay patient, keep patient over and over." We finally crossed the border, everyone applauded. So keeping patience isn't the easiest thing to do. We all need to learn a little bit more about how to keep it.
Are you a patient person? Well, I am not ! Well, I can be patient, I wouldn't like to be. A few years ago my family had a gordon setter puppy. As they are quite rare at @ LOCATION1, we had to go through with @ LOCATION2. A few years later, we raised her and ended up with seven outrageously cute puppies. The puppies crawled and barked within a few weeks. My dog had a hard time annoying her, but she lasted. Two puppies in particular were a problem ! It took patience to deal with them. it's hard to deal with a puppy jumping in our pond and swimming through the deep end and another chain link fence climb. We've been keeping an eye out for them @ NUM1 ! They would bark if you took them out of the water or from the top of the fence. The fence climber left our house first. I was so sad. When there were two puppies left (the water dog and his sister) they were running around the house like mad. My brother and I had to be patient with them. Then all of a sudden they turned into adorable little puppies. I didn't want to get rid of it, but I had to. Our puppies have shown me that patience always pays off, no matter how hard the labor is.
"@ CAPS1" The bell had finally rung and it was time for lunch. I felt like math class would never end. I rushed for lunch without even stopping at my locker. When I got there there was a lunch line that seemed to stretch for a mile. I knew I was going to have to be patient. I entered the huge line. I stayed there and waited. Every minute felt like an hour to me, but I figured it was a very busy lunch day, so I just waited. A few minutes later, I was near the first row. All of a sudden, seven girls got cut in front of the line because their friend let them. Even though it made me angry, I didn't complain and remained patient. I soon had my lunch. In conclusion, this was the moment when I was patient. I was understanding and didn't complain.
During @ DATE1 between fourth and fifth year my family and I went to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1 ! @ CAPS4 rides had lines, but none of them had such a long line and the @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. The line was huge! Like my brothers, their best friend and I approached @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, @ CAPS5 thought @ CAPS5 would never get along. My dad said wait, but @ CAPS5 didn't see the point. When @ CAPS5 got halfway, one of the employees shouted, " @ NUM1 more minutes !" " And @ @ CAPS5 CAPS4 became more excited. Finally, @ CAPS5 became the first in the line ! @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 had to wait for the end of the current test ! But then the loudspeaker went on : “ The @ CAPS4 rides should stop until they are told to continue. A thunderstorm has arrived and @ CAPS5 must do so due to security concerns. " @ @ CAPS4 CAPS5 had planned to leave, but had a feeling @ CAPS5 should not do. @ CAPS5 spoke with other children @ CAPS5 met online. @ CAPS5 played games like rocks, paper, scissors while @ CAPS5 waited under the flag above the line. Once the storm passed, they let us pass! The ride was a thrill! I had wind in my hair, a little rain mist and a thank you from my dad for keeping us in line.
The time I was patient like when I got my dog. I had gone to a jazz festival with my mom, sister and her friend. We were passing a last-ditch rescue and went to see the puppies. My mom didn't want another dog but when she saw our future boxer dog, she gave in. In the center of ???. He was a short haired blue healer mix. We asked the lady if we could have it, but she said they played sports and we could buy it there. We got in the car and ??? at ???. we signed the forms and played with him in the store. Corn ??? in town with him on the sosh and we had an ice cream and went home.
One time I was patient was when I had pink eyes. I was patient because my family went on vacation to @ CAPS1. The first night we got there my eye started to itch and turned all red. So we decided the next morning that we were going to take me to the doctor's office but there was none around but we found an emergency service. So we went there. We waited in the waiting room. Finally, the nurse called @ ORGANIZATION1. So we entered the room. We told him we needed eye drops for me. She said ok I'll be right back. Then my mom and I waited and waited for the nurse to return. An hour has passed and we were still waiting. I was getting really little patient. Then finally she came back and told us that she was working on another patient and told us again that she would come back right away and told us the doctor would be there soon. We said okay. Again, two hours have passed and we are still waiting. Finally, the doctor came with us and said he was going to bring my prescription. So yes, he came back right away. Then my family and I left to return to the hotel to collect our things to go to the campsite. So it was a waste of @ NUM1 hours of my vacation. It was a time when I was patient.
I remember a time when I was patient. It was with my cousins. It was still very boring. I was also sad and lonely back then. so I'll tell you. Not so long ago, I was with my cousins. Everyone, except me. There weren't enough four runners so I was the only one left. I felt so alone. I couldn't believe how bored I was. All I could do was woch with envy. Everyone was having fun except me. Everyone was screaming with joy and laughing until they cried because they were having so much fun. smile to try to look like I'm having fun then he asks me if I want to go I say yes! So I jump on the four where there was no tomorrow. I knew it could just a little thank you to my dad and take off. I couldn't imagine how much fun it was. I felt the breeze hit my face, my shirt folded over my back it was amazing. I wish this day never ends "I said, shouting with joy. I had a lot of fun that day. I never had so much fun in my life. A lot can happen when you are patient. it was worth it in the end it was a time when i was patient.
Nana ! Nana ! Nana ! Nana ! @ PERSON3 is injured ! "I shouted." @ CAPS1 ? How? 'Or' What? "" @ CAPS2 bleeding by the freeway at the corner of the fence @ PERSON1 is with him. "@ CAPS3 replied" daddy! Call @ PERSON4 @ CAPS4! "Chick shouted" @ CAPS5 take @ PERSON1 and come inside! "Chick exclaimed." @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS6 we @ CAPS7 leo! "@ LOCATION1, @ CAPS6, nana and popous carried @ PERSON3 (@ PERSON3 is a horse) to the carport and looked at him. A few hours later, trying to keep him warm, @ PERSON4 arrived. They made @ PERSON3 talk and have started grooming him. They tried to get him to stand up. but @ CAPS11 wouldn't. @ PERSON1 and I were waiting in the house trying to wait and see if @ CAPS11 was going to live. @ PERSON1 decided that 'she was going to help with her hours. They carried the table with @ PERSON3 on it to @ CAPS8 her mother. @ PERSON1 was behind @ CAPS8 when she put the table down. And @ CAPS8 kicks @ PERSON1 in the tree. The next day @ PERSON2 and I were pitching a tent in the back yard. So the horses could cool down. Nana called the vet to see @ CAPS1 that they were in. could do. They got their @ NUM1 minutes later they said they would sting it. And see @ CAPS1 else they could do. They sew from him for three hours. They said to watch him and see if any wounds came out of their stitches. They also said they would check on him the next @ DATE2. This @ DATE2 came and they took him to the statutes and took care of him for a while @ CAPS11 finally got more powerful. This is how I showed the patina in the @ DATE1.
There have been many times that I have been patient in my life before. But I think this one will interest you the most. Finally, we come to @ CAPS1. @ CAPS1 is this large indoor water park at @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION2. I have wanted to go there for years. When we get there my first thought is "paradise", I had no idea there were the greatest lines I've ever seen. And the lines weren't just for the rides, they were for everything. In two fun days, it's already our last day at @ CAPS1. So I wanted to do all the rides one more time. my mom told me to go put on my swimsuit so we could go to the park. So I did. When we got to the park the shortest line I saw was probably an hour. I was so disappointed that I was only able to continue @ NUM1 rides. But I knew it was time to go and leave "paradise". We went to @ NUM2 thinking we would be home to @ NUM3. And we were on the way home. I was so bored I felt like it was @ NUM4 but actually it's only been an hour. It took us so long to get home because it was snowing so hard. I asked my mom when we were going to come home, she told me to be patient. So I accepted it and sucked it up. @ CAPS3 we're home ". I said running inside. In my head I think it was the longest ride ever. I'm looking at the clock, it was @ NUM5. @ NUM6 longer than we thought But I had to go to bed right away (in this no video games) It's a time where I was patient.
I believe that patience is a good characteristic in a person. Being patient is good because you have to wait without getting angry or frustrated. For example if you were on ????? would a lot of people wait for it ??? , if you are patient you would wait, but if you are not you could go off the line and get out. Could people see you now when you are patient ??? Impatient people get angry quickly and can't wait. Well wait for things ??? , which is not pleasant. In conclusion, I believe that being patient is very important in life.
I've been patient many times, but right now my friends and I are saving up to meet @ PERSON1 ! It's a lot of patience just for a ticket it's @ MONEY1 ! So imagine how long you have to wait to save so much money! It's hard to be patient, especially when you're going to meet a celebrity you have the biggest crush on ! I have been patient a lot during this process of saving money. No matter how hard it is going to be, I can do it with patience. My friends and have been patient and still are. I meant, could you stay patient if you were to meet your favorite celebrity you love? Well, it is not that easy at first, it takes a lot of patience to do the chores and take care of your animals, besides counting how much money you have. And when people borrow your money, it really slows you down. But like said no matter what we are going to save @ MONEY1 later to meet him and we are going to be patient all the time we save. It's great fun because you learn a few lessons and see and learn to be patient. Global patience is everywhere, and you use patience in a lot of different things in life.
I had a friend, she is @ CAPS4's best friend and we know each other from class @ NUM1 then in class @ NUM2, she said she had to move to @ LOCATION1. So she moved and still called me twice a week. I always answered and spoke to him for about three hours. I will always remember her. Until that day came she called and @ NUM3 was a little busy because there were people at home. One of @ CAPS4 mum's friends calls me and I told @ CAPS1 (@ CAPS4 best friend) someone is calling me she said okay so I left the phone on @ CAPS4's bed while she was still on the phone. I went to the living room and @ CAPS4 moms friend said can you bring me a drink of water and @ CAPS4 moms five other friends said something. I went to get them water. After that @ CAPS4 mom said go take out the trash so I went to put on the @ CAPS4 scarf and took out the trash like @ NUM4 minutes I made him wait. When I took out the trash @ CAPS4's best friend was and she said @ CAPS3 can you stay outside with me and play a little bit and I forget all about @ CAPS4's friend on the phone. I stayed outside for about @ NUM5 min. then said I had to go back inside. I walked in and sat on the couch and moms friends @ CAPS4 who were at home were chatting and sitting down with then talking laughing, playing and watching TV After two and a half hours while I watch television, I tell myself what I am forgetting. Knew I was forgetting something, but I didn't know what so I get up and walk around thinking what I forgot when I got to the room where I was talking to @ CAPS1 in I Saw the phone on the bed and I picked up and said @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS1 I forgot her. I said hello just to see if she was still there even though I felt she wasn't, which she was. She told me you made me wait the longest of my life. I told him wow you are so patient that i would never wait that long. Come on, you're @ CAPS4's best friend. I'll be waiting for you forever so we kept talking.
Have you ever been patient? I know it's hard for me to be patient! I'm usually not patient because I really like things done on the spot, I don't really like to wait. I can be patient! I can be patient when I wait for short periods. Usually I like to rush, not to my job, but socially, I rush! Being patient means waiting, usually without complaining or moaning. An example of patience is when you go to a party at @ TIME1 and it is @ NUM1 you have to wait a long time ! Usually, time seems to go by slowly! Patience is a quality that is important. That's why I work hard to try to be patient. You should too!
Last year @ DATE1 was my birthday so I told my @ CAPS1 what I wanted for my @ DATE3 and all I said "@ CAPS1 I want a @ CAPS2" ( station @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4). So on @ DATE2 we go out at three in the morning to pick up my @ ORGANIZATION1 and we were at our best. So we walked over to the store and opened the door and there must be more than @ DATE4 people in the store. So we're heading for the game. Me, her and them, there were two texts and there were five people in the section, so we grabbed one of the two. But by the time we stood in line, half the people in the store were already online. Then we waited indefinitely in that stupid line, it literally took us hours to get to the front row. We returned to @ TIME1. This story isn't about what I wanted, it's patience. So I waited for two and a half hours while waiting to buy my @ CAPS2, even if you are patient you will be better thought of and treated than you think.
One day my father and I decided to go fishing. He kept saying five more minutes, so I sat there in the car. Finally, I went out to get him to sleep with a note saying @ NUM1 min more.
One time I was patient was when I was home watching my little brother for my mom so she could do the groceries and my brother was crying because @ CAPS2 was sleepy, hungry so i put him to bed and had to be patient because @ CAPS2 was a bad guy and my mom had been in a dress for a long time and she had to do other things like shopping for clothes, @ CAPS1, shoes, when my brother woke up @ CAPS2 was afraid and i couldn't stop her crying and when my mom stopped @ CAPS2 stop crying and @ CAPS2 started laughing its a time i was patient !
I won @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. I was in @ CAPS4 and the @ CAPS4 was very @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 Proof of my patience was not @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 me @ CAPS10 so iluT in @ CAPS11 from eveone and I got the @ line CAPS12 on @ CAPS13.
I am writing about a time when someone I knew was extremely patient. He had to be patient with one thing: @ CAPS1. When I was very young, once at a hotel swimming pool, I almost drowned. Since then, I was afraid to swim. So my patient friend taught @ CAPS1 how to swim in a pool in his trailer park. What he had to be patient about was getting @ CAPS1 into the deep water of the pool. He wanted @ CAPS1 to go to the bottom of the pool but I was too scared to drown. So he decided he needed to get @ CAPS1 into the deep end somehow. We got out of the pool and walked to the bottom. He just told @ CAPS1 to jump in, but he should have realized that I wouldn't just jump. go swimming or whatever. So after that, I just walked out and he started to get a little frustrated. He was however patient and continued to work with @ CAPS1. After what seemed like hours, he pretended he was going to give up @ CAPS1. I told him that if he stayed, I would go to the deep end. So he did, and I jumped in and realized it wasn't that bad after all. So now I love to swim, especially in the depths. This is how the hard work and patience of my friends paid off for both @ CAPS1 and him.
It was @ DATE1 and I, @ PERSON1, had applied for @ ORGANIZATION1. I had applied to @ DATE2 and was patiently awaiting a letter to @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1 from @ ORGANIZATION2. Since the start of @ DATE1, I had checked the mailbox every day. Every day as I ran down the aisle I hoped that this day would be the day the letter arrived. I was scared because @ NUM1 of @ DATE1 had passed and still no letter. It was like waiting for that moment in the climate of the movie where you think the main character is going to move. @ CAPS4 was the first @ DATE3 to @ DATE4 and I was having lunch. I was like "@ CAPS2 is the day it needs to be." I heard the sound of the mail truck approaching our mail bat and rushing for the door. When I met the courier lady, she smiled, every day she sees me. Every day she sees my smile fade as I check the mail for this letter address to @ CAPS1 @ PERSON2. She looks at me and says "@ CAPS4 this is the day." Patience is a hard thing to get, but by @ DATE1 I had had my fair share of patience.
One time I was patient was when I really wanted a game called x-men @ CAPS3 wolver and my mom said I had what until @ CAPS1 came for a walk down the road. I can understand why she said this because we were a little strapped for cash at the time, so we had to make the rest of what we had a little longer. After a few weeks I forgot everything about the game then on the day of @ CAPS1 my sister and I walked down the stairs so fast that when we were pouring presents I noticed a present with my name on it above. I'm going to grab it and I opened it up and it was x-men @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 and tow other games I wanted to gift that I go up to my room grab my @ CAPS5 and pop in x-me headphones @ CAPS3 and I played it all day
One day I had to be patient because I asked my mom if I could go skating but she told me to be patient so we wait and until she says yes. After we waited, we were crazy because my mom had to go get the money for my sister. So next time be patient, but if you are not patient you will not get your way. Like one day my sister and I want to go to the movies with our friends, so we had to be patient for a whole hour. CAPS1 @ SILVER1. This is how you are patient.
When my friend and I went to @ ORGANIZATION1 it was very busy. By dint of waiting a long time, @ CAPS1 my turn we ??? wait a long time to get on @ CAPS1 my friend has been very patient and I haven't. I kept complaining about the time it was taking. @ CAPS1 we finally got on the ride and had a great time. It was horrible the wait, @ CAPS1 it was worth it because the ride was the @ ORGANIZATION2. It is the best ride in the whole world.
Writing about a time when I was patient is difficult for me because I am not a patient person, but I will try. Three days before the trip to Cedar Point I can't wait for him to be there. I tried to get it through quickly, but it didn't work. I had been out of school for @ NUM1 weeks now and had done whatever I wanted to do. When my mom, sister and friends go, we always have a lot of fun (barely). Every night since, I knew we were going to Cedar Point. I would sit there and think of a day when a lot of kids would ask and complain to mum and say, "It can't come anymore", but I never, not one I know that no one could make the time pass faster. . So I waited done my chores, packed up and watched TV. Believe me, it was very long, very boring and itching to complain but I didn't. I took a deep breath every time it happened to me. And let's just say a little bit of an expectation of other things. I would also think of how lucky I am to go to Cedar Point. I know I am a very impatient person and I am trying to fix it. This is what I try to do and do while waiting for the cedar tip to arrive. This is what the patient is to me, and in my life. It was also a time in my life when I was patient.
Be patient. Well when I have a little cousin from @ LOCATION1 and she was adopted through a call for nominations so I never saw her until I only saw her in the hillper and photos. So I heard her voice on my phone before she looked so cute and I miss my ant and uncle too, haven't seen them in @ NUM1 years. Out @ CAPS1 has always been around waiting for them to come tomorrow or today. It's a surprise that I pass.
It was a cool @ DATE2 @ TIME3. The sun was rising just as I climbed into my box awning. It had snowed on @ TIME1 but it was only @ DATE1. Then again, I was at the top of @ LOCATION1's penis. I was looking for a ten point monster with my brand new @ NUM1 and @ TIME2 pistol that could kill a dear @ NUM2 yards. I've been sitting for an hour but feel like it's a day. I only saw one squarile and it was fun to watch, but not the rush you get when you see a deer. "@ CAPS1, @ CAPS1 !" I was looking in the direction the sound was coming from. "@ CAPS1, @ CAPS1 !" gun @ TIME2 times my adrenaline goes up. "@ CAPS1, @ CAPS1!" I see the movement put my glasses on it and I see it. Is it a grouse? I glared at the gun which calmed down and watched it eat corn. It was @ NUM3. lunch time and all I had was a turkey sandwich, an apple and a bottle of water. I started with my apple eating slowly while looking around when I saw a brown figure move. I grabbed my gun with my apple in my mouth. So imagine @ TIME2 a guy with all of that. An apple in your mouth, and look through a telescope. Looking around I realized he was the big one @ NUM4. Massive horns, a big body and he was probably five and six. I put my crosshair just behind the shoulder and turned off the security. I slowly pulled the trigger. My mind is blurry and "@ CAPS4!" perfect shot. Later @ TIME2 I found him and he was great @ NUM5. I brought him up and that's where he is now.
I was patient when I had to stand in line for @ NUM1 hours just to ride ???. Then I got on it, it took off at NUM2 miles per hour. I was stuck in it for five minutes and then it came down ??? @ NUM2 miles per hour. I went down and walked for miles forcibly and was confronted with it. The drop is ??? . The trip lasted @ NUM1 minutes ??? @ NUM5 people. I went on powa time, it was good. My ??? was the answer he was fun of. I entered as it was in @ TIME1. I woke up and had breakfast. All the time is patience waied in everyone.
The time I was patient I was around @ NUM1 because I was in @ NUM2 grade im @ NUM3 now but back to what I was saying, I was saying I was seven in the @ NUM2 grade and I was standing in the lunch queue and these kids kept lining me up just for lunch and I sat there being patient and myself. but i stayed there so when we did something else i was patient when we got up there i was ok it was ok because i could still eat.
One day when I was patient I was waiting for @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 to come out of the game shutdown. One day until @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 came out I kept looking for signs of gambling and I said "@ CAPS2 must be a good game". So instead of waiting for the game to stop I went home and played football @ ORGANIZATION1 @ NUM3 on my xbox @ NUM4 and then got tired and tired and even more tired so I fell asleep on my pep gaming chair until morning. My older brother woke up and said "Let's go to Gamestop to get @ CAPS1". So we went to the game stop and waited in a long queue for about an hour and thirty minutes until it was our turn to buy @ CAPS1 it costs like @ MONEY2. I had @ MONEY3 my brother had @ MONEY1 he didn't want to put money for the game and I said "I will pay @ MONEY3 and you @ MONEY1. So we brought the game and played it to say that we beat him.
Here is one way I had to be patient, and we all know that ??? must be patient with others. ??? Yes, it was my birthday. I wasn't thinking of my birthday party, my cake or my ice cream, no, I was thinking of making money, presenting without money first. Second gift, yes, there was money. And so on until the last gift. It was a card, so it had to contain money. I couldn't wait to be able to buy something with it. How was being patient in all of this, why, I had to wait, and wait, and wait. It took almost five whole months! Could you believe ??? so there ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???, and have to wait that long? Well, anyway, it paid off. When I finally got it, I couldn't believe it. It was the best thing in the world. That's why being patient is very hard to do, if it's long, but it's also a good thing to do because it pays off every time.
Tick, tock, tock, tock. Every restlessness in my body made me run and look for my dad. Tick, tock, tock, tock. But I stayed where I was, my eyes scanning the crows. Tick, tock, tock, tock. And that I saw him. Tick, tock, tock, tock. I ran forward and gave him a huge hug. The clock in my head has stopped. Hi @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS1 are going to tell you about a time when I was patient. I think I was very patient coming back from my trip, with my friend at @ LOCATION1. I was waiting at the airport for my dad to pick me up and I was so excited! You see, I had been gone for two weeks and I was really homesick. It took everything I had to not go looking for it, but I knew I couldn't run away, I had to be very patient. In the end, it was worth it because it would have been more difficult to find it if I had gone looking for it. As you can see, I think I was very patient while waiting for my dad at the airport. Thank you for your attention.
This is the story of a time when I was patient. It was the @ NUM1 @ DATE1 we were on the plane about to go on a cruise, when we got to the ship I was so excited I thought how much fun I was going to think about what would look like my room and go there to all these cool new places. So we got on the platform and there was a queue and I was patient and waited to get on, @ CAPS1 there was another queue to check your passport so I was patient and i waited. @ CAPS1 there was another sticky line. It was to collect the keys to our room, but I was patient and waited again and stayed there for a bit and it was done, but wait you will never guess there was another line waiting. So like all the other lines, I was standing there on my iPod listening to music. My dad said "ready", I said ready for another line, he said "no" to look at your "room and relax". I was so excited. Finally, we are done with the lines for a blank. So I opened my door with my very special key that we had to queue for and looked at my room, it was amazing. But the bathroom was a bit small but it was great. I was so happy to be done with the lines! It was a time when I was patient.
Once, I was going to see my friend who lived at the end of the street. I walked around there, admiring the sunset scene and the young people playing and laughing casually. A boarder @ CAPS1 waved to me but I didn't trust him enough to answer because he seemed like a weird o. not to be mean or anything. I finally arrived and knocked on the door. She replied about @ NUM1 seconds after " oh, hi @ CAPS2 !" She exclaimed and smiled sweetly. “I have to finish my homework and eat. I nodded. So I went to wait in the park. I sat on the swing and rocked back and forth. An hour passed. I patiently sat there. I wasn't sure if she was going to come out and decided that maybe I should go home. It was getting dark. When I got up, she was outside. I told her I had to come home because it was late so I could come back tomorrow, through. It was a time when I was patient.
A @ CAPS1, I was very patient when our flight received @ CAPS2. We were going to @ LOCATION1 as @ CAPS1 when suddenly the @ CAPS2 sign appeared on the @ CAPS5. I was nice but I said I had to be patient! Our flight was ?????? & @ CAPS14. So when we waited we did a lot of things! First we went by ear in the food court! We chose to go to Chile. we also had to wait for our food! I've had good chopped and they were very good! Then we went to @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7! At @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7, I received @ NUM1 keychain for my friends ! Then I got myself @ NUM2 magizens and a @ CAPS10 read ! I also receive @ CAPS11 @ CAPS12 ! They were very good! Then we just took a little walk around the @ CAPS13! Then we went to sit and relax for the couple @ CAPS14. Then I fell asleep! when we woke up we were pretty much at @ CAPS15 to board ! I was very @ CAPS16 to finally get to @ LOCATION1 and enjoy @ CAPS17 all the time ! I learned that being patient really matters! It was the time that I was really patient
Be patient! Patience is a good learning ability. The three steps to be patient, to be calm, not to complain, and to wait a bit if you have to. My mom and I went hunting with @ PERSON1, my step dad. We had to be quiet so a deer could come. We sat there being silent. I think it was the quietest I have ever been! We were all sick of being silent, but we had to be so that money could come. It was very cold and I was dressed warmly but I was still able to. There was a small heater in the shead we were in. We couldn't complain about being cold or tired. Or just waiting, so we all just sat there without complaining that it was fine. When I was about to ask if we could go in, a ten pointer came out of the woods to find something to eat. We waited patiently for the man of action to approach. @ PERSON1 loaded the pistol and pulled the trigger. The male jumped up and fled. Blow purged! We got out of the head and looked for a blood test. We had to wait a bit to find the deer but he was angry. The right way to be patient, to shut your mouth, not to win and to wait. A good skill to learn is to be patient. Be patient
Being patient is a very manual thing for me, but one day I learned my lesson. It was a @ DATE1 and my mom woke me up at @ NUM1 she said we had a lot to do. When we got in the car I had no idea I was going to have to be painted all day. First, on our way to the @ ORGANIZATION1 market, we got stuck in a traffic jam for about @ NUM2 minutes to an hour. When we finally got to the @ ORGANIZATION1 Marketplace, we must have stood in line for about @ NUM3 minutes. I told my mom I was ready to go, but she said I had to be patient and being hospitalized was a bad thing. After we left we had to take my grandmother to the doctors, it took them almost two hours just to call her by her name. then another @ NUM4 is needed to be verified. After that we went to buy some clothes and shoes and the mall was very crowded and busy. We were at the mall for about four hours and most of the time we were in line. Finally, we got home as it was time for my mom to start cooking. I have learned that I have to work at being patient because that is part of life.
At a @ CAPS2 on the left, you'll have to be patient. Being patient means understanding and tolerating. Someone who is patient struggles without complaining. There was a @ CAPS2 in life when I was patient. Yay! Yag! My mom is taking me and my friends to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. I called a lot of friends and told them if they wanted to go. Meanwhile, we packed water bottles and jumped into the can. We were all looking out the window. OH MY GOD! Watch these great roller coasters. A friend of mine shouted. There we were at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2; the first ride I saw was the @ CAPS3. The tallest and fastest roller coaster out there, they only lasted NUM1 seconds. So we were all talking about it, then we decided to go. Wow! The line is huge. We all said. I shouted it was ok I heard it was an awesome ride let's all be patient. Meanwhile, we waited and waited, until we were finally the next to ride. We did the ride and then all of a sudden the ride started we didn't know it and it only lasted NUM1 seconds. We waited about two hours but it was worth it. In conclusion, I really think that being patient is a good thing in life, even if it takes hours. I have learned so much just by participating in @ LOCATION1, we should all be patient because no matter where you are you will always have to be patient.
I remember one time I was impatient was when I called and told me she was going to send me @ NUM1 $. @ CAPS1 I asked her when she should send it and she said @ DATE3. Today was @ DATE4, which means I had to @ NUM2 days. @ CAPS1 the next day had cameup and the ??? a truck came by and I thought I had money, but it was not yet @ DATE3, @ CAPS1 I said "@ CAPS2". @ DATE1 came, I was still waiting so I tried to go until the day can go through "@ CAPS3 it!" So @ CAPS1 it was @ DATE2 they had my favorite game on sale "The Bully" the deal had a yellow sticker as @ NUM3 and no tax at all, @ CAPS1 I was angry and @ CAPS4 went home House. My dad woke me up and said "its @ DATE3" I @ CAPS1 got up to have breakfast @ CAPS1 check mail, @ CAPS1 he bills, bills, bills and "my money" got me sent a ???. Finally I said I had the money so I bought ice cream @ CAPS1 I bought my favorite " bully " game. “Those were the days when I was patient.
Patience in @ CAPS1 : Understanding and being tolerant is what makes patience. To play in any sports team, you need to have patience. I'm saying because you might not always get the pass or score the point but are still important to their team, your time will come. One time I was patient was when I was on court @ CAPS1. It was during our match that the carman team - @ PERSON1 girls @ CAPS1 opposed the flush. A young flush woman not fouled (I haven't even seen her, actually I don't even know if that happens but you can't argue with the officials) she was shooting her free throws. It was taking forever! I'm surprised his photo was not taken. What was she waiting for? New @ CAPS2 ? I said nothing. I just stayed nice and patient! Eventually the girl shot (@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4), she didn't do either. Either way, I was so proud of myself, I felt really happy for myself. I just realized that the whole time I was standing there was no face, nothing said or thought of anything in my head ! I was just up for the first one, minding my own business and not knowing if it would be okay. Then, on the second shot (you can now steer), I just took the position out of the box. Sit down, but lower your hands and face the basket. I was really happy for myself and even said goodbye to the girl. Therefore, it is worth being patient. First, I got the rebound and my teammate got the point and I also got an assist. Second, I displayed the right way to act the other way around! No one is perfect, you'll have to wait and see who scores the next point!
It was my first game. I was ready to go in, the coach yelled big guy and I was by his side. Then he said at the next play that you were going to play. Then the assistant said no, I wasn't out loud. During all this time, I did not complain. I never said a word to anyone. I have helped other people. It was always fun. During that time, at least, I didn't complain and made it worth it for everyone. The whole time, I was on the sidelines. Never been in no once. I have been very patient. Not to say that I was not crazy. At least I exercised there. All the time I supported my teammates. I encouraged. I help in any way. I listened to them complain. But I gave my support. There I was so angry that I could have killed. I was ready but my coach said no. He has my time to shine. That stupid word kept me from no. But at least I learned something.
Hunting When hunting turkey, you must be extremely calm and calm, you must have a lot of patience. If you move even a musle, all turkeys will run away. Sometimes you will be sitting for hours and hours waiting for one hit. I remember when I was hunting with my dad @ CAPS1 sitting under a tree for three probable hours and finally a turkey came in unfortunately just when I had a bullet my dad scared them all but I still had the patience to stay there for another @ NUM1 hours. This is my example of patience.
One day two years ago I was going to visit the train @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS1 was a @ NUM1 hour wait once we got to the end of the line we had to go pack our bags all the way because my mom forgot the tickets so how we had to wait 9 / @ NUM1 hours to get to the start once we got there the gay told us we could tell him our name and he could find our ticks online my mom got really mad but we have to go on the @ ORGANIZATION1 train which was really fun. this is the time i had at @ CAPS2 pachiant for more @ NUM3 house shed in extreme heat.
In my opinion, being patient is when you are waiting your turn for something. And to be impatient is not to write your turn. In all of your life you have patience because sometimes you might just have to wait. I have patience and I know a lot of people who have patience. I was brought up to have patience when you do something don't rush because you can mess it up. Don't slow down too much because people will think when you don't know how. You can just go to your dough so that you can do it right and the way you want. People who don't have patience aren't always happy all the time.
Have you ever had to be patient before? I have and this story will tell you all about it. Last year on my birthday my uncle @ CAPS1 promised me a phone, but I had to wait for him to get the money. I had to be patient. So I waited and then @ DATE2 finally arrived, several months passed and I still hadn't heard from my uncle. I started to get angry with him because he had promised me this phone. I told my mom and she said he had always been like that and to keep my patience and if he had it a little late. I was thinking in my haad It's been almost a year! Then on @ DATE1 my uncle came over for my family reunion. Then he told me he knew I thought he forgot the phone. I knew he was right, but just then a little light bulb lit up in my head that he couldn't have forgotten. Soon it was time to eat and that's when he introduced me to the @ CAPS2 key. I was so excited I just had to jump in and give a hug. He told me that every time he promised me something he tested my patience to see if the wait was worth the wait and in this case it was. So whenever your patience is tested, keep your cool, everything will come to you soon. To conclude this story, I want to say that patience is important because without it you will never be able to expect anything in life. The @ CAPS3.
You will say that you got on board very quickly. Most people are because when you go out into the woods you can't do anything except look and prune if you make a noise you won't see anything your entire hunt. Hunting is only for patients, but it is a great reward when that doe, that buck, or whatever you hunt is a ritual in your eyes. There are times I was impatient and there are times I was patient when I was younger. I was very important, I would get up and go for a walk but when I got older I got more patient like when. I had my first stag, it was an eight point. The @ MONTH1 hunt takes patients but I like it and it's fun.
I was patient once when I had to do a few @ CAPS1 and my mom was on the computer. I needed the computer for my @ CAPS1. She told me she would only have a few minutes. So I waited, decided to watch an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants while I waited. At the end of the episode, I returned to the computer. She still hadn't finished! So I made bagel bites which are pizzas on a mini bagel. I ate @ NUM1 ... and so on, got to @ NUM2 and started to get full. But I continued to eat. I ate and ate. I was really hungry. I finally got drunk, so I decided to quit. I went to check if Mum was finally done, but she hadn't yet. I went out to play sports with my friends. We were there for about @ NUM3 @ CAPS2 got tired and finally all got home. As I walked through the door, I looked at the computer, it was still in use. I went to take a bath because the baths are soothing. I spent time in there because it was so warm and soothing. I came out. I went upstairs to change. I went downstairs and surprisingly my mom was gone ! I went upstairs but she came in and said it was time to go to bed so I woke up early to do my @ CAPS1. It took a lot of patience because it was hard to wait that long.
I was patient once. We were a way to see the point. The family had been with us. We were all in the car and vans @ NUM1. I was like and the @ NUM2 van and the car and @ NUM3 in the car. It was like an hour's drive @ NUM3. I was in the car with my mom and sister @ NUM1. We have been and took for about an hour. First I was on the foliage then I just had a goodbye family chat for an hour I was so patient. And all I could here was for my mom to be patient, we went. I'm like no no I want to be there @ CAPS1. She likes that we have all day. Then we stop to eat something. Then we were there.
I once had to be patient when we went to @ CAPS1. It was in a minibus with my mom, dad, little sister (@ NUM1 months) and aunt. We were in the van for about @ NUM2 to @ NUM3 hours. By the time we got to the hotel it was @ NUM4 ocklock @ CAPS2 time and at @ LOCATION1 it was @ NUM5 or @ NUM6 am. I was very tired of being patient, I'm not a very patient person so my mom was very proud of what I did with the baby crying and being stuck in one place for hours. It was very difficult but the result was great!
Being patient is difficult. I hate waiting. For the days to come, the mail or the packages, the people, whatever. Patience requires efforts that do not have. I have never really been patient. I don't know many people, who are either. There is my mom who "pretends" to be patient, she is not! I think one of the least popular phrases is " be patient " ! I stiffen up and get frustrated when @ CAPS1 is hospitalized ! When @ CAPS1 is waiting to call someone, I'm tempted to call them a hundred times. I'm patent when I want to be (which I never do), when I want to be and when I don't know if I'll be impatient in about three seconds because @ CAPS1 is done with the page writing and the time has not yet expired.
When I was @ NUM1, my mom started giving my @ DATE1 gift. She was going to do a blanket. Unfortunately, she couldn't find the blanket. I have to be patient. I had and it wasn't, so ???. My @ DATE1 was almost @ NUM2 months ago ???. She ??? found a time for ??? that she ??? find ??? in @ NUM3. I have been patient and every year on my @ DATE1 and on @ CAPS1 I ask if it's over but I'm not. East ??? Can I be patient a bit ???
One time I was patient was when I was fishing. We were fishing on a cold night and no fish were overwhelming. I was just @ CAPS1 being patient planting sunflower seeds . My father was angry and I was always @ CAPS1 in the process of listening to the games backeasard celtcs . We only caught small fish that night, nothing to eat or keep. We left at about one in the morning and went to get the boat from the tralor and I was in the dark and cold. I finally had to get in the water, put the boat in and tie it up. On the way back, a Bentt Traler Popod tire awaits you eight kilometers from your home. I was always patient but my father was not. We pulled over and when we got out to look at the tire. We didn't have a spare so we went home on our rim. he is the most patient I have ever been. At @ CAPS2 this writing sample, she could have explained what a millennium is. It would make things clearer. She could also stop using I to start most of her sentences. That would make it more instening. In the third sentence, she put were instead of was. It would make her smarter and get a higher grade. In the second paragraph, I'm not sure if I said @ TIME1. or @ TIME1. If she said if it was morning or afternoon, that would make the story clearer. If she fixed all of that, it would be a good sample.
When I was patient, I was seated at a rest. And I ordered my drink and Mike was the first. Then when we got our food they said it would take about five more minutes so I sat there fifteen minutes later she came back and made the wrong food so I was losing my patient's food . so I just relaxed. She came back with my meal on time. The maid so I was very happy. And I was really hungry so I ate it real quick so when I was done they gave me a free descont because of the mixture they had with my meal. And my mom bought me something from a store for such good patients that I had. And that's when I was very patient.
We were going to @ CAPS1. Me and my cousins were so excited! We were waiting for it to climb the horizon line. After eating, my cousins and my ??? directed towards the horizon line. The horizon line gave you the whole thing ??? cedar tip. “ I'm so excited, ” said one of my sisters. "yaa me too!" said the other. We were walking towards her. It took a really long time. When we saw the line, we fell for it ! “ It will take so long, ” my sister said. I was so surprised my cousin @ NUM1 years old she ??? ???. “ Wow that looks really high, ” my cousin said. "@ CAPS2't, worried we have @ CAPS3 with us. She will take care of us," said my younger sister. Finally it was our turn. There were @ NUM1 little kids behind us. Wanting to keep going so badly. " Why @ CAPS2 don't you go ahead "said my cousin. I was shocked that my cousin had so much patience. Usually she started to want everything first! I was so proud of my cousin. We had a great time there. Hope we come back!
Patience is a hard thing to have, but there are rewards to having it. I had a teacher who nobody remembers, gave us our report card in music class. So after a few weeks, I made a bet with him that if he didn't bring us our ballot the next day, he owed me a raffle bag. Weeks passed, then months passed, until finally. It was the end of the year. And he still didn't have them. Once the schools restarted and it was halfway through the school year, the teacher in my group walked in and gave me two packs of swittles. I then remembered the deal we had made and said ?? yes are only supposed to give me and he said to me "the second is? be too patient.
Patience is precious. Every day I go to basketball practice to watch all my friends play. I am training @ CAPS1 because a few weeks ago I broke my ankle while playing soccer. It takes patience to sit in a gym and watch your friends have fun for an hour and a half. Every @ DATE2 and @ DATE1, I sit on the bench and watch the team play a basketball game. I have a choice of @ CAPS1 to go to games, but I have patience. Thus I'll go. It is very boring to sit there, but I am doing it so that I can watch and play @ CAPS2 year. You now know that patience is a virtue. It takes a lot of patience to really do anything. Do you have patience? Patience isn't when you sit somewhere for a while and get mad at someone. It's when you are calm and wait.
The only time I was paitent was on @ CAPS1 last year. Some of the reasons I was a pacifist were to be alone or, as you know, to be silent. The @ CAPS1 isn't that hard, but when you need to have patience is when it gets tough for you and me. Pacents is the key because you will have to use it for a long time! But let's get back on track, okay. On the @ CAPS1 when you are done you have to wait until your classmates have finished. So, during this free time, you can read a book or check your work. Pacents is also important because when you take the @ CAPS1, you can't just run into it. You have to take your time and know that you are on time. This is where the pacents come into play ! Sometimes when you're done with the @ CAPS1 you can just sit there and think about what you did today, which is why I'm saying it's because of other people ! If everyone in the class doesn't have a rhythm, you are very likely to fail @ CAPS1. You must have a quiet and silent room! Now, if everyone in the room is quiet, then you can and will do good. When I have the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS8 rhythm when I'm done because I care about others, I used to work with the @ CAPS1. I understand that you no longer have the @ CAPS1 but it is to be patient ! When I get my test results this year in seventh grade, I hope I did well because my classmates and I all had patients ! And remember, this is the key to success !
One day at school, @ PERSON2 was in line for his lunch when suddenly @ NUM1 children appeared right in front of him. @ PERSON1 told the kid that you know you have to go to the bottom of the line on the right. "@ CAPS1 we don't. Said the kid. Then a few minutes later a girl named @ PERSON4 (who @ PERSON2 likes) was walking to the back of the line but @ PERSON2 said she could cut in front him. So she did. Once @ PERSON1 and @ ORGANIZATION1 got up to find out where they had food and they were waiting to pay for it, when the kid @ NUM2 walks away from @ PERSON4 elbows can't remember his @ CAPS2 student number to guess he was a new student. So they must have done it. A @ CAPS2 student is dialing the he paid for his food. Eventually they crossed @ PERSON4 sat with friends, but @ PERSON3 had @ CAPS1 to sit because his friends were outside. So @ PERSON4 saw him and asked if he wanted to sit with her, so he did. Fially he was done @ PERSON4 asked if @ PERSON1 wanted to go out during recess and he said sure, but one of @ CAPS3's friends did hadn't finished eating, so they had to wait for him. When she was done, she got out, it was done, that was what @ PERSON1 was waiting for the bell to ring to enter. He was angry but he got to hang out with @ PERSON4 the whole time.
The last @ DATE1, while I was in my family with my oozing dad, I taught my brothers, my friends and I how to the goods. It's not really the case, I tied the first one. Using all of my step dad's steps and being patient with myself, I prepared myself in the water. Out of the blue [literally we were on a lake] I improved my skills just like @ CAPS1 ! No I could do anything! When the water level came to an end and I brought my boat up to the cabin. I insisted that she cry over the water at the bell. But when we got out of the lake, and I had done a few laps in the lower one, it was up to here to decide if she was going to try to skill for sure. We sat there for what seemed like an hour awaiting his decision. But, in the end, she decided not to try. I was very proud that day because I didn't try to persuade him to push him to try it. I was very patient with her. And although her decision was the wrong one in my opinion, I will not be proud of myself to this day, for what I have done on this boat.
When I was @ NUM1 my mom wasn't patient all the time and was so bored ! But one day she was going to take a shower, but people kept going and she got patient for a while and I went up there. I saw her and I hid. As I glanced from cover to cover, she was still there, almost falling asleep and she was still patient. Another one walked into the bathroom and I went quickly and I said “@ CAPS1, excuse me but my mom is coming, she was waiting. So I woke up my mom "mom, mom wake up go take a shower!" and she woke up and took a shower, after she got out "ahh" it feels good "it was better." The end.
When I was about seven years old And my mom was pregnant with my sister @ NUM1. It was the night before she got it. We were all asleep. When my mom started screaming we all went to her room, my dad asked her what was going on. baby. Then when my dad realized he forgot about us. So when he came home to pick us up. It was already morning, they took us to a room. They prepared my mother. Me and my little sister were waiting in the seats next to her. Then when they took her for an ultrasound, we had to wait. It was finally time to deliver her. My sister and grandmother, myself had to wait outside the exit room, we were so patient it took over an hour to get her out. when they sewed my mother, they took my little sister to clean everything. When we could see her through the window. I was to see her take her first bath, injections. And when they put those patches on her, I thought she was @ CAPS1. But when they brought her to our room my mom looked dead and my little sister @ CAPS2 was so beautiful. My mom said she was so proud that we are so patient while waiting for our little sister. My mom said she would call him @ PERSON1. And we all loved that name. I was so @ CAPS3 that day.
Patience is something that few people have. I'm in between, I can be patient sometimes, @ CAPS1 at other times I am not. To be patient is to be understanding and tolerant. It also means that you can go through tough times without complaining. Every year I'm not that patient, and every year we go to @ LOCATION1. We're going @ LOCATION1 for Labor Day, to cross the bridge. The rule is, if you do n't complain , you get fudge. I thought I wasn't going to have caramel, because I had pulled muscles in my legs and the night before the embers burned my legs. I knew that in order to get fudge I had to be patient. So I dressed, walked to the bridge, gathered all my confidence and patience, and began the mighty walk. Every year we try to beat our walking time on the bridge and I thought my legs would slow us down. So I said to myself "be patient" over and over again and then I accelerated past the first three miles in @ NUM1 minutes (because my legs were exhausted). I knew that to break a record we would have to walk two miles in less than twenty minutes. We were walking faster than I expected and I felt like my legs @ CAPS3 were about to explode ! I couldn't do it anymore. I knew I had to stop and complain, @ CAPS1 my legs kept telling me "@ CAPS2!" @ CAPS3 wouldn't let me stop, @ CAPS3 was: tolerate pain and be patient. I also had to be patient if I wanted fudge. So I increased the speed and accelerated to the finish line not only to get fudge, @ CAPS1 also to beat our record. With patience I got a delicious fudge and we broke our record. It was a moment that I will never forget as I had patience and kept going until I crossed the finish line. That's how I was patient, and I'm glad I was patient with my legs. I'm not very patient so thank goodness for the patience!
I was patient for a while! To be patient is to be tolerant and understanding. Sometimes when @ CAPS6 is in a bad mood I have @ CAPS9, please be patient when someone asks me a stupid question or gets on my nerves. One day (last year) I was feeling sick and upset, it was @ DATE1's vacation and my little sister @ ORGANIZATION1 wanted ice cream, but not the ice cream tank which ran every twenty minutes from the ice cream shop which was about seven @ CAPS9 ten blocks away. I was locked @ CAPS3 in my blanket when she jumped @ CAPS3 onto @ CAPS9 my bed. "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 I want @ CAPS9 to go get some ice cream. @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 !!!” @ CAPS5 I say meanly. @ ORGANIZATION1 small hob - goblen get off my bed OR @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 YOU @ CAPS9 A @ CAPS10 !!! I was younger and in a bad mood at the idea that crying is so stupid and amazed. Tears came to her eyes @ CAPS9 and I didn't realize at that time that she was little (several years old) and I didn't quite get it that I was not feeling well. I apologized and explained that I was ill. Immediately after she ran out of the room and ten minutes later, she came back with a hot cup of tea and @ ORGANIZATION1 said “I asked mum to make you some tea.” It made me very warm @ CAPS9. After I drank it @ ORGANIZATION1 asked me if I was feeling better. I said a little then @ ORGANIZATION1 put @ CAPS3 on my bed and started bouncing. I was patient with her and I knew she didn't quite understand yet. So I took @ CAPS3 and got her i took @ CAPS9 to the ice cream shop @ CAPS9 to buy ice cream. @ ORGANIZATION1 was happy and that made me happy. I fell extremely proud to have been patient with @ ORGANIZATION1 the day before she pissed me off. I know I was not patient with @ ORGANIZATION1 at the “start”, but by the end I was.
It was a @ DATE1 @ TIME1 and we were standing @ ORGANIZATION1. We all wanted to get on the boat and tube. We took care of the boat and we are all ready to go, we tried to start the boat but there was nothing. My @ CAPS1 and my cousin took off the backs of the seats and drilled through the back, there were water boat routes the birage pump had stopped working. My step dad looked at them and said he was going to be rewired. He soon re-wired the boat and it hadn't worked, all the kides were starting to get upset. All the adults said we have to be patient. Everyone had now calmed down and moved away. Very quickly we heard a boat start that sounded like the one from my @ CAPS1. Later that day, my mother told me “ patience is a virtue ”.
I am constantly moioly patient because of my younger sister. Sometimes it's easier than others to be patient with her, but most of the time I'm able to handle it. I think this is a great example. A cold @ DATE1 @ TIME1 I was in my mother's room and I saw her put on makeup. I asked "@ CAPS1 did you manage to do your makeup with @ CAPS5 ?" @ CAPS2 replied "with patience and years of practice". The next day, when I had received an allowance, I asked my mom "@ CAPS3 mom, can we go to @ ORGANIZATION1, later ?" @ CAPS2 responds "@ CAPS4, @ CAPS9?" I replied "@ CAPS5, I can wear makeup to train". "@ CAPS6." @ CAPS2 says. When we get there, there are @ CAPS5 a lot of choices to choose from ! I asked my mom to help me select the best! After our departure ; it's time to come home and practice! Unfortunately my first makeup lesson didn't go very well, but I asked my mom for help and @ CAPS2 said "@ CAPS8 I know you'll get it soon!" and i was wondering out loud "@ CAPS9?", @ CAPS2 almost said like a whisper "because anyone can pay someone else to do their makeup and hair, but hardly anyone can or will only take the time and patients to learn it on their own. "
When my @ CAPS2 and I entered the queue at @ CAPS1, @ CAPS6 heard impatient moans and signs around us. Almost every line was extremely long and the whole store was packed. I moan with everyone, annoyed by the long wait. My @ CAPS2 continued his happy hissing and didn't seem to notice it. "@ CAPS2 this will take forever!" I cried. "@ CAPS3 isn't that negative. It's not that long. @ CAPS4 replied. @ CAPS4 saw my dazzling gaze and laughed. " @ CAPS5 about @ CAPS6 playing a game ? " @ CAPS6 a continued a spy game for @ NUM1 minutes or so as the line slowly progressed. After @ CAPS6 finished our game, @ CAPS4 continued chatting, then checked his list to make sure @ CAPS6 had everything while I was playing a game on her phone. Soon @ CAPS6 was next and I smiled in relief, and thought it was a good thing @ CAPS2 had us busy ! As @ CAPS6 walked out of the store , my @ CAPS2 said, “@ CAPS7, when you're patient you get food !” @ CAPS6 both laughed and went home.
Every year my whole family and I take a trip to @ LOCATION2 at the beach @ LOCATION1. Everyone in my family who goes is me, my mother and my father, (???). my little sister, my three cousins, my aunt and uncle and my grandparents. We all stay together in a large hotel, which usually has @ NUM1 rooms. Of the whole year, we only stay two weeks. So I have to be very patient for the remaining three hundred and fifty-one days. While we are at it, we fish for sharks and stingrays, hang out on the beach and swim in the ocean or in the pool. So it's definitely worth the wait. I'm still having a great time and now I'm patiently waiting for next year.
I remember everything was as clear as glass ice. It was two summers ago when my mom, two brothers and I went to point @ PERSON1. The drive took about an hour and a half, maybe two hours. I was really excited to participate in the new ride at point @ CAPS1 - the @ CAPS5. With nothing else to do but listen to music and look out the window, this car ride became an eternity. Of course, once we got there we still had to do a lot of other rides. We usually start at the front and work the hack, doing things in order. I didn't mind since we mainly used large roller coasters with a few acceptances for rides like @ PERSON2 @ CAPS2, @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 and @ ORGANIZATION1. My mind was very distracted from the Maverick with the madness and fun I was having at the time. Unfortunately, it became more difficult to keep my patience once I got to @ CAPS5 as the line lasted almost an hour and a half. Guess the line was to be expected considering it was a new ride. After waiting so long, we finally got to drive it. The @ CAPS5 was incredibly epic. In the end, all my patience paid off and I had a great day.
I will write about a time when my sister was a patient to go to the dentist. My mom once said she was going to take my little sister to the dentist. My sister was so happy. My mother also had to go to other places. First, we went to the costland mall to get an evening dress. After that we had to go to the shoe depot to get me some shoes. Third, I went to my hair done. Finally, we were on the way home but I told my mom that my little sister had to go to the dentist. When we got to the dentist we had to wait @ NUM1 min. I told my little sister @ CAPS1.MG all day that you have been patient. I couldn't do that.
Why wasn't my uncle there yet? Go on! I said there was a trick bet in my back, falop used in the ?? and the only thing I had to call for help with was my cell phone. Where was uncle @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1 all I'll quickly look back to see what was wrong : I was at my uncle's house waiting for him to hurry so I could go hunting. I don't wait. Opening of ?? very quiet door and ?? with my @ NUM1. Guage, I then ran to work and into my tree stand. We had this stadium for so long ?? could remember. What I see now - was a bad thing. The scale was? and we felt like it was going to break. The top tilted and broke several times in different places. We kept telling ourselves that we were going to rebuild it, but we never got there. So after I climbed the ranks I left the? by my side and I waited. The hunt took a lot of patience, but I didn't need it. There, standing on the horizon of the tree, was the biggest male I had ever seen, I almost said it was so beautiful. By loading a stud in the barrel, I aimed ?? Boom I shot zzz +++ ! I missed the chance! The stud tilted to the side. I grabbed the gun so I could put it on ?? ?? sown and even the edge. The gun landed elbow ?? I even turned around to see the stud come down. I turned ?? if I were facing the ?? and I tried to stand up but my leg was twisted. Then with a big crash !!! The stud fell into my ?? were stuck under my back I tried to move but my back hurt too much and my ?? were starting to bleed. I was lucky not to break my neck and so my esd problem was not patient at first. But I learned my lesson and wanted and was patient enough to wait until my uncle was within range of screaming. I got in trouble and learned the hard way to be patient
So one day, in fifth grade, I was running around playing cat on the playground when ' pushing ' I pushed the slide one end of one ??? or are they in pain then ??? i went to the doctor and waited two hours and stayed patient by not moving my arm at all watching other people come in and out finally they called my name they told me my arm was broke i couldn't put a plaster in there for us i went to the other doctor across the way i waited @ NUM1 minutes and got a blue cast about a month later i l had it removed I went back to the x-ray room but then said I had to throw it out again this time I got it ??? and finally to take it off and that's when I was patient.
The time I was patient was when I went to @ CAPS1.BI @ CAPS2. My dad went there and he did a bunch of workouts, he stayed there for about @ NUM1 months. In the end, if they were successful, they received a prize. So there were a lot of people. We had to dress really well. We had to face all the people who were getting rewards that we didn't even know. The worst part is that they made speeches. Then after what seemed like hours, my dad got up ! I was so happy he got his prize! Then we have to go. It was then that I had to be patient.
Go! Coach @ CAPS5 yelled. The @ CAPS5 football team and I were running sprints to warm up for our game today. The day @ CAPS5 was planned, first football then the friends birthday party @ CAPS5. I could hardly wait. That's when I felt a rain fall on @ CAPS5's head. Before I knew it, I felt another, and another, and another! Suddenly it had started to rain. The @ CAPS5 team and I rushed under a nearby awning. @ CAPS2! The thunder almost shook the ground. Finally, the referees arrive and announce: "the match has been delayed". I signed and collapsed on a picnic table. I now knew @ CAPS7 would be patient if I wanted to get through it today. There we sat under the awning as the rain poured down on the root and thunder erupted. I crossed. @ CAPS2! @ CAPS2! @ CAPS2! More thunder came. It took @ NUM1 minutes without thunder for the game to resume. Before I knew it we were already at the @ NUM2 minute. Even the slightest clap of thunder and we would need to start over at @ NUM3. We were now at the @ NUM4 minute. We listened intently until we heard an @ CAPS2 ! From the frustrated far north, I say "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 my!" The @ CAPS5 team has started counting the minutes again. Finally, after the longest @ NUM1 minutes of life @ CAPS5, there was no sign of thunder or rain. The game was back! The @ CAPS5 team and I sprinted in the field. We played our hardest game but unfortunately lost @ NUM6. We left the field with our white socks and splashed jerseys. With mud. Each of us was soaked. @ CAPS5 mom gave me the "@ CAPS6 up" look and I quickly ran to the car. “ I told @ CAPS5 myself. As I was running through the wet grass, I heard trainer @ CAPS5 yelling behind me :“ @ CAPS7 is having fun at your party @ PERSON1, and @ CAPS8 for being so patient ! ” I smiled and replied“ @ CAPS8 coach! ” That day I realized that being patient was a good quality for @ CAPS7. A lot of people appreciate it when you understand and don't comply during hard times.
On the way home from a doctor ??? .I was getting bored of being ??? I didn't want mom to get any more upset. So I tried a big one to be patient. Every now and then I played with the seat. @ NUM1 minutes passed and I was getting more and more patient. Buy I always keep + roln. A time came home, I went myself relax
One time I had to be patient was when my dad was waiting to receive the money for our chiuahuce @ CAPS1. It was @ DATE1 and my dad sold his guitar to his uncle to make money for the day he didn't have it. A day has passed and still nothing. When my mother came to get hers ??? I went to swim practice trying to be patient and wait for my dad to get the money. Around @ NUM1 hour my dad called saying he wouldn't get the money until @ DATE2 @ TIME1 ! I was angry, but still tried to be patient. A few days passed and soon it was @ DATE1 again. I was so excited. We finally got @ CAPS2 which I had been waiting patiently for a week and was fed up with. So when I was him, my patience was worth it. It was the moment when I had to be patient for something right. It had really paid off.
Being patient is what you need to do in order to do anything in the world. An example is school, how do you use patience. One way is to be understanding with your teacher because they are there to help teach you for life. If you are not patient and understand your teacher, you will not get anywhere in life. Another example is with your parents. You have to be tolerant of them, they have been tolerant of you. If you don't have patience with your parents and listen to them, you won't learn all the life lessons they give you, without their skills you won't get anywhere in life.
I once knew a girl named @ ORGANIZATION1 and met another girl named @ PERSON1. They had been inseparable until high school. @ ORGANIZATION1 had made a lot more friends and was starting to become very popular. @ PERSON1 called @ ORGANIZATION1 everyday to see how she was doing and or if she wanted to go out. @ ORGANIZATION1 kept lying to @ PERSON1 saying she was busy and always telling lies and firing her. But one day @ ORGANIZATION1 had a really bad day and when she tried to tell her new friends about it and apologized for the way she was acting. @ ORGANIZATION1 had learned that @ PERSON1 was truly a true friend and was patient with @ ORGANIZATION1 during bad times. It shows that if you are truly patient, only a good thing can happen.
I once had trouble getting an @ CAPS1 on my report card and my mom said I was being punished. I asked him how long I would be punished. So I went up the stairs to read a book. An hour later, I went downstairs and asked. How long am I grounded? She said I don't know how many times should I ask you to say it. Sow, I was bugging him all day. She said I'm running out of patients. I said can you just tell me she said okay. She took out a sheet of paper. I said what is it? She said I counted how many times you asked me. Twelve times " yikes " ! I said twelve days and it's final, I said okay. I think I'm reading a lesson today? Don't bother your mom all day and do better in school!
One beautiful sunny day I went out and was driving my pleasure and all of a sudden my mom yelled at me and said she was going to go get my new good in @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, and she said I couldn't go there @ CAPS5 I just sat waiting, waiting, waiting and waiting. Then I decided to play playstation @ NUM1 (@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4) @ CAPS5 I had been playing for two hours in the strait, then decided to go watch @ CAPS6 murder (@ CAPS7). After that I returned to play on Playstation @ NUM1 (ps @ NUM1.), Again. played for another hour. Then all of a sudden I hear beep, beep, @ CAPS5 I'm looking out the window, and it was my. @ CAPS1 ma. Then we talked about the new qlad, then I hear a beep, a beep and it was my. my . new @ CAPS8 !. Then I ran out, took it out, and rode it for about @ NUM3 strait hours. This is how I had the patient for about @ NUM4 to @ NUM5 hours. I was proud of myself after I finished riding my new @ CAPS8.
Patient I was patient when I was on an appointment @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2 to wait in the waiting room. My teacher tells me to wait a bit because the teachers are talking to someone else. When I have a @ CAPS3 teacher say not to open it then I have always been patient. When someone tells me to wait. I am also patient when I wait for buses, planes, trains to come. I am patient when I miss the wait sometimes. This is how I was patient.
I'll tell you about a time when I had to use patient. I had to use patients while I was waiting for my friend to fix my x-box @ NUM1. My friend was taking forever when he tried to fix the x-box. All I did was sit on a chair and watch him. He finally fixed the x-box after about seven or eight hours. Once my friend and I started playing the game it broke again. So we had to bring the game to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and ask them to watch it. I had to have patients because if I hadn't, I would have been really bored. After @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 looked at the system, they told us they should take it and then watch it. It took me almost four days at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 to fix the system and send it back to me, so I had to have patients for the system to be delivered. Patients are a very needy thing in life. Now you know everything about a period in my life when I had to have patients.
"@ CAPS1 activated". Said my little brother. The @ CAPS2 line veers forever. "@ CAPS2 is the last time we are on @ CAPS2 ride". The ride we were on was Space Mountain at @ ORGANIZATION1 landing at @ LOCATION1. As we were queuing for the ride there was a sigh that I have and @ NUM1 min of water from point @ CAPS2. It was hot and I felt like I was walking smiling. The line wouldn't go any faster. My older brother was happy for some reason. No one could understand that we were queuing in @ NUM2 weather. I was as patient as I could get, just stood in line, hoping to pay myself, we could make order. The first hour has passed and another sigh has arisen at @ NUM3 point time @ CAPS2. We have all gone mad. The path to the promenade seemed silent. I know anyone could hear a pin drop like a drop or someone's ?? hit the ground. Everyone being patient. Finally, we waited @ NUM4 hours to only make one trip from @ NUM3. It was the first time that I was this patient.
One time I was patient was when I was in the car going north to @ LOCATION1. I was in the car for eight hours, my cousin @ PERSON1 was driving and my @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 was sitting next to her. I was in the alley with their dog @ CAPS3. My cusin @ PERSON1 was talking all the way. I tried asking to stop and go to the bathroom and get some food but they are " botton " so i waited and waited an hour with a friend so I tried asking again.
One sunny afternoon I was so expected because. I was going to see my favorite band. When I am at school! My mom picked me up from my house, I was so excited it was time to go. My father dropped off my brother at my grandmother's (he was only at doy so he couldn't go). I ask "@ CAPS1 we have another two hours before we get there, then another hour so we'll see the place here." mom said "@ CAPS2, can I have my dvd please." I side. I've been in the car for two hours now. Then we went whenever my mom and dad wanted to go, not where I wanted to. Then it was time to go see. The @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 ! When we arrived I was a little sleepy but that didn't stop me. When they've only played two songs, I want to sleep on the set. I waited all day to see them and went to see. It was a time when I was patient to see my favorite band.
I remember the time when I had to be so patient, it wasn't even funny. I had to be patient to get my new cell phone. My mom told me I was going to have one at the start of the school year. I waited and waited until the school year started, but my mom told me I would have to wait another week because she didn't have the money for all the school supplies she bought. 'she had done. So I waited another week. I was so excited when I remembered my parents were planning a trip to @ LOCATION1 this weekend so I had to wait another week. It was the next @ DATE1 when I was at my cousin's house and my mom walked in and surprised me with my new phone and I was so happy I finally got it. So I guess you can get some cool stuff when you are patient.
About a year or two ago we drove to my grandparents' house. They live in cold water so it took about @ NUM1 hours. All my relatives on my father's side were there. All the presents were under the tree and I couldn't wait to open. Parents were just talking nonsense so I opened my big mouth and said "can we open the presents now" we said open the presents but the adults had to start. They are the slowest gift openers ever I was about to tear the gifts from their hand`s and open the gifts I don`t get that thought because I was patient. After I finished I said, "yes" of course thought my little cousins were to open next. Let me tell you they`t fast at all either. After that I finally managed to open my gifts. In the end it was worth it I got an x-box @ NUM2, and more @ MONEY1. It was then that I was patient.
The patient is a very difficult thing to do in life. It is one of those things that sometimes it is impossible for people to do, even for small children. You can tell when someone is patient is when they are polite and take their turn without complaining. Sometimes people don't like to be patient, I know I don't like @ CAPS1 very much. People who are not patient tend not to be @ MONTH1 ??? granted others are waiting. But people who are patient, sometimes they tend to be boring or silent, don't talk much even when they talk, do they ??? talk when people bother them. And they don't scream like someone else at all . It is good to have patience because you will grow up with a ??? (illegible part) good family good friends and a ??? So in conclusion, this is why it is good to be patient.
A time when I was patient. It was when I went to the story of the book and I won a book. I was at the bookstore and wanted a book called tayler swift at @ LOCATION1 as a schoolgirl and my mom said if you are patient then yes, and I was so happy because she knows I love tayler swift book and his life. As soon as I got it, I started reading it. My mother said thank you for being patient I was welcome I said thank you for buying it. I told my mom if we could go to the bookstore and she said no today and I keep asking and she said no and I keep asking and she said maybe. So I was and the car was listening to the radio and we when at the mall and there was a bookstore in the mall and I ask if I could look around and my mom said yes and she said find the bok you wanted I find it and she drinks it. It was a time when I was patient. One thing I'm learning is to be patient if you want something and don't keep asking.
A time when I was patient. I am patient when I go hunting. I know that at some point the back of a life might walk within earshot. And if so, I'll be ready. The first time I shot a deer was with my baw. And I remember setting there being as patient as I could be, waiting for a deer to come within range. Then I hear the leaves crack. There it is the deer I'm going to cry ??? How you remove it. As I shot I could feel the hovering arrow launch my bow. Then the arrow hits the deer with a thud and the deer flies away. I wanted there in my tree to be ready to go and blame my deer. My dad and I followed him about soft and it was there. I was so excited everyone screamed. It was nice to know that all of my patients and my hard work had paid off. Thanks for reading my story. Hope you took advantage of it.
Patience it takes a lot to have patience. My sister once tried to hate me but I didn't let her get to me @ CAPS1 I have patience @ CAPS2 I am doing so I watch TV she does the task @ CAPS3 can you move around in front of the tv and she moved she sat next to me and keep touching me it didn't bother me at all she asked me again and again "@ CAPS4 I am @ CAPS5 you" I have said '@ CAPS6' i go to antil i do done i said so you don't mind putting my face out @ CAPS2 i'm really mad so she tried her best trying to tear up my work at home so i said i don't care she had a smart comment and i keep watching tv so i was so patient with her she said i was going crazy so i ignored her she got it angry and kept saying, you hear, I come out and I said I can not let her get to me @ CAPS1 I went into the house and i sat down and told her you can't make me mad so you might not stop so she said girl whatever and i was so ready to say somethin but i dont 'was not going to give him anything to feed disabled.
I am writing about someone who was patient. My mom was patient when she got her money that day. She wanted it to come but it did so she was mad for a minute but the next day it came. And I said I'm telling you mom it's coming this day. did i get when the money yes the bee ??? You did. It's a day but I haven't done where to do when. And was patient in not calling people and asking where his money is and things and the next day there was no one at home so I had to then we want the @ MONTH1 they have the money and got all ??? We ??? The mall where I was searched happy me and my siblings.
I remember when I went to @ LOCATION1 to visit my mother in law for @ CAPS1 and went fishing. I didn't really go to do it because I'm such an impatient person. The cove we were going to fish in was right behind his house. I grabbed a fishing rod and went into the "yard". I threw my fisherman's lips into the water and waited. After maybe @ NUM1 minutes or nothing (except my sister who grabbed most of the stuff.) It finally started to unravel. Excited, I stood out of my seat, knocked it over and grabbed the real one. Twisting and turning the handle for what felt like an eternity, I lifted it. The fish was small compared to what my sister caught seconds later. My mother-in-law rejected the fish. After another @ NUM1 minutes, I got frustrated and went swimming. After an hour of swimming I went back to my rod and decided to be more patient. I waited for my line to start moving and got up and twisted the reel faster then ?? I had caught the biggest fish of the day. I sat down and waited a full hour for my line to move. I then caught another fish. Happy, I dropped my cane and told my mother-in-law. My patience led me to catch the biggest fis of the day and learn something new.
Patience is when you can wait a while without complaining or give up the wait and that patient. An example of being patient is let's say you line up for @ NUM1 hours to get tickets to see your favorite band play. Now to wait @ NUM1 hours in line is to be patient to get the tickets. While I'm complaining or whatever. Being patient is very respectful of yourself and others around you. But I also think everyone could use a little patience. I think people should think about patience more often. If everyone in the world didn't have patience, the world would be a crazy mess. Example : @ CAPS1 would also be waiting for them. Everyone would wait to be the first. It might just be crazy. So I'm glad that there is patience in this world and people have it.
I was patient when I had an appointment with a doctor. My mom and I had waited almost an hour for them to call me. Twenty minutes later, the nurses call me. She says sorry for your wait. Thank you for being patient. Then after my mom took me to get something to eat for us to wait @ NUM1 minitus later gives us are food from the drive through. Sorry, thank you for your patience.
It's a story about what patience means to me. Patience is when you have a problem and you don't complain about it. For example, I had to give my mom @ NUM1, but I didn't have the @ NUM1 written at that time and there my mom didn't complain, she waited until she had patience . Patience doesn't mean you keep begging. It means that you are understanding and tolerant. If your dad said he was going to give you pizza, be patient and wait for that pizza. When you have patience, people will have patience with you. For example, if you were watching TV and didn't want to get up, people will have patience and wait for you to get up. Patience does n't mean you keep asking. For example, I was at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 begging my mom for candy not knowing if I had patience and waiting for her response, I would get the candy, but I didn't. This is my story and what patience means to me.
One person I know who is patient was my old teacher named @ PERSON1. He was a very patient man, even though we annoyed him. If we didn't understand a question he explained a million times that he was still patient. Even when we had attitudes with @ PERSON1 he was still a patient man. I think @ PERSON1 was determined to be patient with us as he had to pray as he was always patient with us through thick and thin. @ PERSON1 was the teacher and the most patient person I have ever known ???
Patience, what is the first word that comes to your mind when you hear this word? Waiting for? I know this is the main word in my mind. Here is a story where I was very patient. Every kid dreads the meap test, it was @ DATE1 and we need to be completely silent. It's hard enough to be still. But it's harder when you're next to your friends and you're a girl. We had to do meap writing, writing is the worst for me. But when I was done I felt really good and calm to everyone. This is the story where I had to be patient.
The patient can be a very difficult thing for me to have sometimes. For example, when I go to a restaurant when we are waiting for our food, I get on board very easily. Back when my ankle hurt from a soccer injury. A few months later it still hurt in the same spot. @ CAPS1 my mom made an appointment with my doctor. When I went to the doctor, she felt a lump or a broken ankle and said, "I don't think there is anything wrong, but we won't be sure." @ CAPS1, she sent my mom and I urgently to @ NUM1 with a note saying I needed an x-ray. After about twenty-five minutes of driving, we were there. When the nice lady checked us in, we waited in the x-ray waiting room. My mom texted my sister saying we would be in awhile. I had to wait because we waited there for a whole hour! Obviously, this was a time when I had to be patient as I was already nervous about a possible ankle fracture.
To be patient is a wonderful thing to be. Here is an example of my patience for my birthday. My birthday was coming up and I was extremely happy. I always looked back on my days, so I had a personal calendar to count it down. After that, I made a lot of birthday lists. I went to the stores to see what they had. For an example, I saw these beautiful shorts that had a matching belt. @ NUM1 days before my birthday I wouldn't eat. I also went to @ LOCATION1 and saw all the wonderful cakes. The day came and we went shopping for whatever I wanted. I conclude ??? I was patient.
Once I was patient was when I had to be patient to have a difficult task without any help. Not a single one from me. It was so hard. I had an hour to finish it. I needed three hours to finish. It was so difficult that even a collage student couldn't finish it. @ ORGANIZATION1 was the toughest test match I have ever done.
"@ CAPS1, how much longer." I complained at the airport, "@ CAPS2 has been waiting for about two hours now." "@ CAPS3 will only be a few more minutes sweetheart." replied my @ CAPS1 in a stern voice. "@ CAPS3 better just take a few minutes because I really want to go to the @ CAPS5 world." I complained again. As you may know by now, @ CAPS2 is in an airport full of people. @ CAPS2 had to wait six hours for our flight to take off for @ LOCATION1. @ CAPS3 took a lot of patience that I thought I would never have. In the first hour of waiting, I was really really bored. I had nothing to play with other than my gameboy @ CAPS6. The gameboy @ CAPS6 is a square-looking object that folds up. There is a screen at the top and controls at the bottom. It was my only pleasure that I could use to occupy myself and not fall asleep. I was very bored. But luckily I found a @ CAPS8.V. that they had at the airport. @ CAPS2 went to @ LOCATION2 to watch, but the only channel @ CAPS2 could watch was the news. I didn't like watching the news at all so I played my gameboy. I played it for about an hour. I have '@ CAPS8 said anything to my @ CAPS1 in the last two or three hours. I didn't want to bother her @ CAPS8, so I left her alone. When the next hour passed, @ CAPS2 finally boarded our plane. @ CAPS2 waited a total of @ NUM1 hours and @ NUM2 minutes. @ CAPS3 was a painful but memorable experience. When @ CAPS2 got on the plane and found our seats, my @ CAPS1 told my brother and I that she was very proud of our patience. By now I understand why my @ CAPS1 and my dad don't @ CAPS8 like to fly to places anymore.
@ CAPS11 was @ DATE1. @ CAPS11 was almost time for @ CAPS1's birthday. @ PERSON1 was going to be six years old. He was helping his @ CAPS6 bake his birthday cake. After they finished making the cake mix, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS6 put @ CAPS11 in a cake pan. She put the pan in the oven for @ NUM1 hours. Can't wait for my Sufer Yammy chocolate birthday cake to be made! ' said @ PERSON1. A few minutes later, @ PERSON1 asked if their cake was ready. '@ CAPS3 @ PERSON1 said @ PERSON1 @ CAPS6,' @ CAPS4 still has about @ NUM2 hours and @ NUM3 minutes your cakes are ready "" @ CAPS5 that @ CAPS4 will take forever "moans @ PERSON1" You must use your patience @ PERSON1 "she said." @ CAPS6 what is patience? "@ PERSON1 asked" patience waits for something without complaining @ CAPS11 "explained @ PERSON1 @ CAPS6." @ CAPS7 you can do something @ CAPS9 time flies faster . Like playing a game, riding your bite, playing with your friends or playing in the sand boy. "" @ CAPS8, "@ PERSON1 said," I'll do something else. ' @ CAPS9 @ PERSON1 came down the stairs to play his video games. When he was done playing his video games, he checked the oven to see how much time had passed. There were two hours and thirty minutes left. @ CAPS9 @ PERSON1 decided to go out cycling. He put on his helmet and got on his two-wheeler. He went for a walk on the neighborhood trails. He saw his friend and joined them on their bike ride. After their bike ride, @ PERSON1 asked them if they wanted to go play in the sandbox. They all said yes. @ CAPS9 they went to the backyard and played in the sandbox. @ PERSON1 and his friends all created this huge sand kingdom. @ CAPS11 had large castles and @ CAPS11 had a trench all around @ CAPS11. @ CAPS11 has occupied the entire sandbox. @ PERSON1 went inside to ask how long was left on the oven. "@ CAPS6 how long was left on the oven ?" asked @ PERSON1 "Only five minutes left," said his @ CAPS6, "you should take this time to brush off all that sand. I see you and your friends are covered in @ CAPS11. And when you're done you can invite them over for a piece of cake. When @ PERSON1 and his friends finished ridding them of the sand, they all came in and held a piece of cake. After everyone finished their cake, they all said, " @ CAPS11 is the best cake ever ! ""
"@ CAPS1 activated, @ CAPS2 !" I screamed. We had just gotten our tickets to my favorite amusement park in the world; @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. “@ CAPS5 down, @ PERSON1,” my @ CAPS2 told me. “I'm coming,” she said. I'm usually not hyper hyper, but I love roller coasters. It's also nice to just delete @ DATE1 and @ CAPS1 up to @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. I live at @ LOCATION1 so the commute is not that short. My @ CAPS2 had just finished giving our tickets to the man. “@ CAPS6 your day at @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4,” he told us. “ @ CAPS9, @ PERSON1, what do you want to drive first ? " My @ CAPS2 asked. " @ CAPS10 about @ CAPS11 ? " I asked my @ CAPS2" @ CAPS12 not? " she answered. By the way, if you didn't know my name is @ PERSON1. But that's not important at the moment. What is important is to get on the @ CAPS11. My @ CAPS2 and I stood in line for about an hour. Seemed to take a while, but before I knew it we got tied. Now I know the @ CAPS11 isn't the biggest ride, but it's still pretty big. The @ CAPS4 is, I was a little nervous. Everyone gets nervous before their first ride, and as we went up it all started to get smaller and I started to get more nervous. The @ CAPS11 ended up being awesome ! After the @ CAPS11 we rode the mantis, the @ ORGANIZATION1, the wicked @ CAPS16, @ ORGANIZATION2, the @ CAPS17, The average @ CAPS18, the @ CAPS19 @ CAPS20 @ CAPS21 and the @ CAPS22. “@ CAPS23 right @ PERSON1, choose last ride,” said my @ CAPS2 @ CAPS24, it was easy. We hadn't done my favorite ride yet. “ @ CAPS25 is going on the strength of @ CAPS26, ” I said. We stood in line. The sign said the wait was two and a half hours. @ CAPS24, I took the tour, and it is totally worth it. The wait was finally a little longer. The wait was four hours and I wanted to leave after three hours. I waited, however, and while I thought it wouldn't be worth it, I waited. It was totally worth it. The wait was terrible, but it was worth it. I really enjoyed my day at @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4, and I'm glad I waited for the fastest lap.
??? ??? ??? was around the middle of @ DATE1 my family and I were going ??? @ LOCATION1. ??? / middle @ LOCATION1. I was so excited I ??? days ??? with all my ??? (part not readable) and accessories.

I'm going to write a story about patience. Patience is when you wait for someone to do something. An example of this could be if someone else is fixing something for you and you've really waited for it to be finished so you can move on with your life, but it's the kind of thing that takes time, can - be a lot of time, but if you want it done right, you will have to wait. Sometimes it won't be a person that you expect, but an inanimate object, like a TV show, that cannot be rushed, even if sometimes you want to push it around. However, with a human, if you push them to do something (which can happen, @ MONTH1 ends up being worse and even pausing about ten seconds after doing it, @ MONTH1 ends up happening faster. can also waight for nature too, like sunny day. When it @ MOIS1 has been raining for over a week. You can also wait for the power to come back during the storm. For me, I really wanted the power to come back on running during a thunderstorm because there is nothing to do !!! Patience is also waiting for your ??? as when you are bored
When I was patient, when I broke my thumb, I was patient because I wasn't complaining, I wasn't crying. I wasn't really doing anything because I didn't even think it was broken. I wasn't really bothered. Then I waited at the doctor and had it checked, the doctor didn't think it was broken because I almost hit him with a punch, but he x-rayed it just in case or. When he came back with the x-rays he said it was broken he was very surprised that I was surprised everyone was.
This last @ DATE1, my family and I went to @ CAPS1. When were we in flagstaff we went to ??? It was basically a great ski slope. When we went to the top ???. I was afraid that I ?? go follow. When we got to the top I could see the flag pole and somehow ??? .I got dizzy and I didn't like heights, I started to end it. I was happy to stand in line to get off. When I got off I fell better and still felt like I was going to come back up. ??? I love my mother and ??? That day was the worst day of my life. I was happy the next day. When we went to @ ORGANIZATION1.
Sometimes it is difficult to be patient, especially when you have to be tolerant of small children. Well I have to do that sometimes when I go to visit my little cousin, @ ORGANIZATION1. @ ORGANIZATION1 is eight years old and annoys me. She asks stupid questions and does stupid things and I don't like her at all. My mom says, "When you grow up you will both be best friends", @ CAPS1, okay I don't think so. Whenever I visit her, I just have to put up with her and be patient. Right now I have to take care of her, but when we grow up we might become friends, but maybe not.
Once when I was patient when we went to Green Bay and it took @ NUM1 to get into our @ CAPS1 and when it was finally the time we got into the @ CAPS1 and it was @ NUM2 over there ie @ NUM3 our time and I was a little upset. The next day we went to play toy and my sister was crazy and my mom wanted to have a van and we tried a white van and me my brother and dad like white but my mother and my stupid sister didn't like like the white dodge van and we tried the silver van and my dumb mom and sister loved it but me brother and dad hated it oh and we got the dum silver van and it took @ NUM4 to get the van du du and it was stupid to come home. The @ CAPS2
Patience is the way to be one ??????? patience waits a while for something, like ??? IF you wait a long time without getting angry while reading, you are what everyone else is patient with. If you keep this habit, you will have a great life which ????
The first time I learned patience was when I was my mom said she would play with me @ NUM1 I wanted it so badly but had to wait to get it so I did and i waited and waited and waited so if i thought it was a whole month and nothing happened i was so angry but i didn't do anything so we went to wal mart and she bought me a part @ NUM1. I was happy. Later i requested an xbox (stirl seven) my mom said wait i waited @ NUM3 months but still nothing. @ NUM4 month nothing, @ NUM5 month nothing, I was so angry but a whole year went by, I had @ NUM6. I was awesome to have my own room and @ CAPS1. I have an xbox @ NUM7 to age, it's great.
Oh I have a great story on patience! One day, I was at my @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2. There were my two brothers my little sister, my @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2, and myself present. My, @ CAPS2 was ready to serve ice cream @ CAPS4 all of a sudden, my siblings started screaming, I go first, I go first ! Lathan ?, asked my @ CAPS2 ? I responded by saying, I'm not part of this! I think you @ CAPS6 how long is this going to last since it was @ CAPS4 that was freaking me a little bit, I'm sad, @ CAPS7 ! Get in line! They were like ok. So patiently everyone is in line and has chosen the type of ice cream they have made. And what a choice we had vanilla, strawberry, mint, cookie dough ice cream. Everyone settled in and enjoyed their ice cream cone.
I was patient when I went to the docteis to get ??? ??? I didn't complain about it. I had to wait @ NUM1 hours. Then when I walked in it took about @ NUM2 hours. Then they did some testing and then at the end I finally made it home. It was then that I was patient.
Once I went hunting. We arrived in the woods @ NUM1 or earlier. When we got there, we found a place to sit on the floor. We were going to stay in the woods until dark or we kill our deer limit. When it was or @ NUM2 ½ hour until dark we saw a dow but when we moved the gun to fire it it worked. We don't move or talk . Then more deer came. But they were really small so we let them go. When they had about @ NUM3 minutes left until nightfall, a good sized dow arrived. It was too far away so we waited for him to get closer to the rifle pole. He fell but he was still alive, lying down. We waited like @ NUM4 or more minutes and then he died. It was one of the times I was patient.
There are many ways to be patient, such as when you are waiting in the lunch queue or when you are in line to leave the room. Here was a time when I was patient. It was time for this trip to go skating and I was telling some about it and wanted to go right away but I didn't say it because I knew I had to be patient. Then we got there and I wanted to come in and skate but they had to tell us the rules so I didn't say anything. Then we went in to skate, but the queue was long for the skates, but I didn't push or shake to make my way, I waited patiently. Then I skated and ate then left, @ CAPS1 how patient we are.
Patience, can you be patient? Some people are, some are and some are not. Some time I can't. Well, hearing is a matter of patience. Once at school in the queue, it was long. It would shake things up . I wanted lunch so badly that I was not patient. But for some reason my friend was patient. I told her why are you so patient? She said because everyone is going to be able to eat something. I said yes it's true. So I tried to be patient and before I knew it I was sitting next to my friends talking and eating my food.
I was so bored "I was so bored, but I know it would pay iof. I was on the run ??? and it took / heavers. In this sense, I went to the bathroom, I had lunch, I played with my most sellfon, I slept then I soller then I have @ CAPS1 ?? when is it us then ??? ??? ???.
I was patient in gym class today for my shill test, I was very successful in getting @ NUM1 on @ NUM1. We have @ NUM3 biols in my class so it was quiet the wait too when it was my city it took half a minute to do it. We wasted all of our holdings on shill will and I was waiting to play dodge ball. It starts because we couldn't play dodge ball. So I pretty much wasted my invite on the shill test and it's starting, it's going to test my story, the end.
I had to be patient when I really wanted a @ CAPS1 bike crank and had to make money for it, so I went to @ CAPS2's houses to collect leaves until I showed them some excavator paths. In @ CAPS3, I had the money for my @ CAPS1 bike. It was hard to be patient but it paid off in the end.
A day of dreadful patience " can we go now @ CAPS1. I'm so bored that I complained. I waited for a response but I guess he just decided to ignore me. We were here at @ LOCATION1 waiting for those sloths to load his truck. Impatient guys. "That's it, I'm going to go talk to these guys and see what the whole heist is. Wait here and don't touch anything. @ CAPS1 said. So I sat here bored and hungry, waiting for what seemed like hours. Eventually my @ CAPS1 came back and told me it could be another @ NUM1. The things impatient men resort to. We were sitting here and getting pretty impatient. We decided to go for a walk for a while. After collecting some food, we returned to the truck. City dwellers are just plain stupid. A forklift driver failed to jam his forklift truck in the trailer. That's when my @ CAPS1 had it. He got out and all he heard was screaming and screaming. FINALLY ! After my @ CAPS1 yelled a bit, we finally hit the road. That day, I learned that something I definitely don't have is patience.
The time I had @ NUM1 be patient was when I was at my first soccer game. I wanted to come in but had to wait. I waited an hour to enter. The team was tied in @ NUM2 at @ NUM2 and it was @ DATE1 and we were still winning. The coach had an injured player so he set me up. I ran so fast I tackled the guy with the ball he dropped and ran for the touchdown. If I hadn't been patient, I wouldn't have won the game because the coach wouldn't have told me that was the moment when I was patient.
Once, I was patient is when I went for a haircut and she told me to come @ TIME1. But when I got to @ TIME1, she had like @ NUM1 people in front of me but I didn't care because I had nothing to do after that. So I was just going to sit there and be patient and I had my best friend with me so I wasn't bored and we were just sitting there talking and texting our little friends. So the lady who was about to cut my hair came to me and said I'm so sorry, but I told you at the wrong time and said oh it's okay I can wait . And when she was done with their hair, the ladies came to me and said they were sorry. So she had @ NUM2 nobody left and by the time she was done she was getting along like @ NUM3 - @ NUM4. And that was when I was patient.
For me, the patient is one of the most important traits in a person. Being patient with someone is very important. It can make friends for you, it can get you a girlfriend or boyfriend, and it can give you some of the best things in life. Once, patients offered me a hockey stick. About a month ago, I broke my old hockey stick during an away game. After the game I knew I needed a new hockey stick so I went to the rink pro store where I was playing. " Do you have steam @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1 @ NUM1 ?" " I asked, wondering if it would be easy to get. "@ CAPS2 buddy, we just ran out." @ CAPS3 the seller gives me a little shrug. I knew if I wanted the stick. I should look harder. When I got home I looked on the internet to see if there were any stores nearby with it in stock. No chance. Guess I'll have to order it online. I said to myself. The delivery was not quick. It took about @ NUM2 weeks for it to arrive. It was worth all the time and effort.
I have patient until the @ DATE1 vacation arrives. I try to do my best in school until @ DATE1 comes along. Example @ CAPS1, last year I was on the honor toll @ NUM1 times. During @ DATE1, if I have to make a return or patient @ DATE1 , then I will and will not leave @ CAPS1 at the last minute. Then I will wait for the resumption of school, which will be a fresh new year. I will also wait until @ DATE1 again. But in between we have breaks and days off, I think we still have enough homework over the years, let's start we go to school @ NUM2 days a week. School can be a lot of fun sometimes eg @ CAPS1 I look forward to field trips and school activities. But we have to be careful that the principal doesn't take away our privileges, for example @ CAPS1, if our behavior is bad or we get too many deductions, she will take it away from us. This means that all my patience will be @ CAPS1 nothing. It really wouldn't be fair because most of the time it's my classmates who are causing the problems.
At a time when I was patient, it didn't happen once, it happened all the time. The time I'm patient is when my mom is talking or getting her hair done at the barbershop. Today I'm going to talk about the time she did her shopping. When my mother does her shopping, she brings all the women in my family, my cousins, my aunt and my grandmother. Either I go to the mall with them, I stay in the car, or I stay at home. I'll talk about when to go to the mall with them. They shop for at least eight hours and at most ten hours. They don't go to a mall or stop, they go to at least two malls, three at most. They also go to a lot of malls, for example just fashion and things like the rainbow. They go to a hundred places for at least eight hours, my feet are starting to hurt and I'm hungry and tired, but I'm not complaining because I'm patient. Now we're in a mall, I'm going to be carrying bags and going to a lot of women's clothing stores like victoria @ CAPS1, @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2. So shop for jewelry, makeup perfumes and all the famous ladies' items in the world. In addition I get lost because they leave me. In conclusion, I am very patient for my mother no matter what.
I write about a time when I was patient. Because I was about to go to a party in I had to be patient but I had n't done so I got mad I just couldn't wait. In I also not someone who is patient. They just couldn't wait, they really couldn't wait, but I waited, waited, waited, got mad, I couldn't even wait. I was actually waiting for my aunt to come get me she didn't come @ CAPS1 I called my mom she said she was going to take me to the party I was patient she didn't come @ CAPS1 I'm not going to the party in I Was Crazy. Because my mom didn't come to pick me up, @ CAPS1 I called my grandmother and she came to pick me up. It was the only time I was patient to learn.
You have to be patient when you go on a trip. I was patient during my trip to ??? PA the last @ DATE1. I had to be patient until @ NUM1 hours before my family and I arrived. The next day I had to be more patient as we went to a fun park. There I had to wait in very long lines, '@ CAPS1 is really hard to be patient. Is @ CAPS1 difficult for you to be patient. It's history when I had patience.
It's about three o'clock @ CAPS1 the clock tells me, but I can't fall asleep because my @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 and I are going fishing. It is eight hours @ CAPS1 now my @ CAPS2 was supposed to be there at seven, but my grandmother just kept saying he would be there, then I think but I was a little inquiet.Maintenant it's ten o'clock @ CAPS1 know. I'm just pissed off im about to cry but my grandma said he would be there I said "@ CAPS4 he won't come into my room so I realize he He will be there, he will be there. So I heard the door open. This is a moment when I should be patient.
I remember a time when I was @ CAPS1 I was home it was Christmas time The first one got up and I just wanted to open all my presents and presents but I had to wait that everyone come down the stairs and @ CAPS2 mom to get the @ CAPS2 camera that we open introduces my brother and sister, what do you want first ?? The older one goes first a rule my brother made up then finally it was my turn I just took the gift at random and tore the paper not to even look at the gift because it was my turn I had been @ CAPS1 all this time was the time when I was @ CAPS1.
To me, patients mean doing your best to wait for someone or something. I remember a time when I was patient. Me and my @ ORGANIZATION1 went to the water park and wanted to get on this water slide and there were a lot of kids and adults in line so we waited @ NUM1 and then we were finally in the second line. The children in front of us offered to stand in front of them, but we refused them. So we waited while the lifeguard told the boy to hang on because it was his first time going down a water slide. But the little boy fell from a tube that hit his head and all drowned because he couldn't swim. It was scary but we still went and had a great time.
Clunk ! I have @ CAPS1 in my seat as the rental car crashed into another pothole. “@ CAPS2 are we” asked in a dismal voice. "Ohio" replied my mom's friend @ PERSON1. We were going to @ LOCATION1 with my mom @ PERSON1 and me @ CAPS3 @ PERSON2 during spring break. We would stay in the flowered @ CAPS4. While we were there we were visiting my dad while he was working in @ CAPS4. I was going to be a memorable trip, but I knew the drive there would be the ultimate test of my patience. It would take us @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 days to reach our destination. The @ NUM3 day would be the most difficult of all. It was the day we were going to drive through the mountains. I can usually pass the time when riding in the bends, the ?? the @ CAPS5 ??. However, when we made it to the top of the mountain @ NUM3 everything got hectic. First of all my @ CAPS3 (who was sitting next to me) started screaming because there was no guardrail and we were in the lane near the edges. Second, my @ CAPS3 started grabbing my arm like his life depended on it. Finally, and worst of all, my bladder started to rise! Everything is in place to make our pleasant ride through the mountains, a roller coaster that I will never forget in a moment. All the time, I was thinking to myself. "I'm going to go crazy ! Just stop it. I pulled into a rest area with a toilet. If I hadn't been patient on this hike through the mountain, I would have gone crazy. I would have been sitting down. in an asylum I will always remember this hike through the mountains.
Today was the first day that I was patient. I could not believe it. I was so proud of myself. This is how I was patient. I was waiting for ice cream in the line and this teenage girl walked over to the counter and said "@ CAPS1 you I have to be somewhere in ten minutes if you don't move that line I'm going to have to talk to him. waiter All the guys said "I'm so sorry but you'll just have to wait until everyone in line in front of you gets there stays before you. " "@ CAPS2 are you kidding me" she shouted as she stopped and that's when I knew how ridiculous I looked when I was hospitalized, so I stood in line until I got up at the counter and said, "Deal with a lot of people like this, because you handled it very calmly. And he said yes, there are a lot of people who are like that here, it's really sad. So @ CAPS2 would you like to order ? " I told him my order and I went home on my way home, I felt so proud that I'll never hospitalized.
One time I was patient was when I was waiting for my gymnastics competition to start. I had to wait two hours with my team. We warmed up and stretched and talked about who we think would win the tag team trophy. We asked our coach if it was almost time to start. He said it was going to be another hour. So, we talked a bit more and practiced some floor skills. We had a pear tree contest and did everything we could to pass the time. We asked our coach another half hour later and he told us it was going to be another half hour because they had to bring in another judge. Finally an hour later the judge got them and the coaches had their meeting and we stan ?? The encounter. It was a time when I was patient.
I will write about when I was patience. One day I asked my mom if I could have a phone, she said if I was patient I could have a phone so I was patient. Time went by goodbye and her family were sad, yeah you see when i had the patience to have a cell phone i got one. Have you ever been patient with your family? Tell me if it worked or if it went wrong with your family, if you are it will probably work for you. And that's what happens when you are patient.
"@ CAPS1! Has it happened before ! ?" I shouted, running home from the bus stop. She was standing from the mailbox, holding a thick wad of envelopes. One of them, I hoped was the letter. "@ CAPS2 again honey," she said, "but there are a lot of bills to pay." I wanted to scream in exasperation, but remembered what @ CAPS3 said, " just wait long enough and you'll get what you want " I trudged inside and let myself fall on the couch. This letter meant so much to me. He was saying what advanced classes I would be in. It doesn't seem so important, but only the elite could get in and it meant the world to me. I would be challenged my parents would be so proud of me and I would get @ NUM1 dollars from grandma. See, you take a test at the end of school and you wait all @ DATE1 for the results. A good system, eh ? No ! Very quickly other things distracted me, swimming competitions, tennis, books, and I learned that it helps to be patient and time flies a lot faster. @ CAPS3 was right, I guess. A @ DATE2 @ TIME1, the @ DATE1, I was on the porch reading. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the postman. He dragged in his bag and took out some mail, put it in our mailbox and left. I jumped up from my chair and ran to the mailbox. I quickly studied the mail, until an envelope caught my eye. I opened it and of course it read @ PERSON1 was selected for the following advanced courses : @ CAPS4 studies @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 ! My patience has finally paid off!
The time I was patient was the time I was @ NUM1 on @ DATE1 it was a snowy night and my mom and dad were buying a new car it took so long I was so hungry that mom and dad were chatting with the car dealership my brother and sister were playing @ CAPS1 when my mom and dad were done talking with the car dealership, they looked at the car they wanted and one of the employees got me brought my brother and sister a box of cookies and milk while my mom and dad were looking at the cookies, we were still hungry but I showed the patient's. My mom and dad found the car they wanted, picked a van with an @ CAPS2 inside, paid for it and we left when we did, my dad took us to @ ORGANIZATION1.
I'm always a patient person until I sit there for hours, then I can oh patient person. My mother is also patient, especially when it comes to the appearance of her work. A lot of people have been very rude to us with her.
One day, just a few months ago, me, my brother and my mother were writing in line to put in school supplies. We were number @ NUM1 and they just called @ NUM2. It was around @ PERCENT1 and we had to stay there. It had been so long since the new battery I had just put in my @ NUM3 died. Took about NUM4 hours to get inside. Then there were even more lines! We barely had our things that day, but because we were patient, we did.
I didn't know where we were. Then my dad told me, we were at this place called Buddies. I have never been there until this day. Then the waitress put us at a circular table. Then she asked us if we would like something to drink. I told our waitress that I would like a dietary pepsia. My sister had a fruit punch. Like always. My mom and dad had mountain dew. My brother had cherry pepsia. I don't know why we all drank different drinks. It took @ NUM1 minutes to get our drinks. My father was not that patient. He knew food would take forever. Finally, our waitress came out with our drinks. She apologized for the wait. Then she took our order. The wait was @ NUM2 minutes. My father was very impatient. I was the only patient at our table. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. I told my dad to be patient, the food will be ready in a few minutes. So we waited and waited. Finally, the food came out. We ate all the food, got the bill, and then left. It was then that I was patient.
I will write about a time when I was patient. My family and I were making decorations one day for my @ NUM1 @ CAPS2. I was so excited and nervous. I was ten years old, so that was a big deal for me. We all had the cake ready which was decorated with beautiful yellow and white frosting. There was also a picture of horses running @ CAPS4 and "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3". @ CAPS4. The party started at @ NUM2 am. I was in my pretty pink floral dress and I was putting on banners. I kept asking @ CAPS4 what the time was, and my mom was just saying be patient. I had to wait. I was a very impatient girl. I was so excited I couldn't wait. I remembered then that I was supposed to be patient, so I was. I played games and read books while waiting for the guests. Then before I knew it, the doorbell rang and my whole family came running with gifts and curds. I guess all this waiting really paid off. I also received some really cool gifts.
Every day at school i have to be patient to get my food like pizza, salt, shortbread with milk which is bad all the time but i check my milk. I had to be patient to get my gun.
Elkhorn jr. High school, @ DATE1, @ PERSON1 colbonthorne had pretty bland days he absolutely hated school he just wanted to come home, @ CAPS1 his teacher told him to sit down and do his homework so he tries to killing time by touching erases toys on the board. after about sixty gum peaks he looks at the clock and reads, @ TIME1. He complains to his teacher and she says ''. @ PERSON1 if you are not patient, I will send you home! '' @ PERSON1 exclaims, '' @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1, in detention after school '' then @ PERSON1 sits down for fear of being restrained and does his job, all day, without complaining '' finally ''. The teacher says when the @ ORGANIZATION1.
I waited, couldn't wait to watch the silent audience. However, I couldn't see very well because the stage lights falling on me were quite blinding. I was standing next to my best friend @ CAPS1. On the other side of the stage were our competitors @ PERSON2 and @ CAPS2. As I looked forward I thought about how I got here and why I was here. I was looking out of the small classroom window as @ PERSON1 continued to talk. She said there was a competition for the whole seventh grade. We had to pair up and write a story about whatever we wanted. @ CAPS1 and I looked at each other and the shock is yes. Later that day I rode my bike to @ CAPS3's house and thought about what to write. @ PERSON1 also stated that whoever wins will be able to enter more writing contests. I was so excited I almost jumped up and down because I love writing and competing. I jumped off my bike and ran over to @ CAPS1 already shouting ideas. Finally, we decided on something to write about. It would be a story of adventure and how a plane crashed in the middle of a jungle. In the end, we had written ten pages. I went over my acer and typed the ten page paper. After all the spelling and grammar checks, we printed our story and returned it. The results arrived at the end of the day, it was tied between @ CAPS2 and @ PERSON2 and @ CAPS1 and me. So our writing was given to the state for another compition I ronaly @ PERSON2 even and my pair won again! I really hope we are not tied for the national competition. So there I was on stage, still watching the audience thinking about how I got here. I was so tired of waiting. @ CAPS1 told me to have a patient so I did. After twenty minutes of judging, the president came over and declared that @ PERSON3 and @ CAPS1 won first place. We jumped up and down and won the trophy. @ CAPS1 and we have found that hard work and patience can really lead to something great.
A @ CAPS1 I was patient to wait for a game to arrive. I waited @ NUM1 years for this to come and the @ CAPS1 finele came. I started @ CAPS1 as if it were any other. @ CAPS8 the @ CAPS1 just kept @ CAPS4 so @ CAPS5 the time I @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 I just sat on the porch the rest of @ CAPS1 @ CAPS8 it never came so I just went to @ CAPS9. The next @ CAPS1 I came to @ CAPS7 I checked the mail @ CAPS11 it was empty so I stuck to the trainer and I watched TV I looked at the front @ CAPS12 and it was a package that was just @ CAPS13 that was my game and that is the story of my patients.
I was at a @ CAPS1 wing match once while waiting to get tickets. It was very long and boring. There were a lot of people in this game. As much as I just wanted to go to the front row and get the tickets, I didn't because that would be rude. I felt it helped me develop my patients a bit more. Also, I wouldn't want people cutting me off in front of me online. I have learned that good things come to people who wait.
One time I was patient was when I was sitting at home for hours on end waiting for my grandma to pick me up and go get my friend. I believe you should have a lot of patience to go further and wait for what you want.
There were many times that I was patient. Maybe like waiting for a doctor's appointment or waiting for your teacher to stop teaching so you can finish your homework. Maybe wait days for your teacher to stop teaching so you can finish your homework. @ MONTH1 will be waiting days for your teachers to come and take your tests. But today I'm going to tell you about when I had to be patient to have my first dog. @ CAPS1 It was last year when we went looking for a dog to adopt. We couldn't find the correct one. @ CAPS1 took @ NUM1 weeks until we saw the cutest chichuacua. He was only one year old. We would rush through the papers for fear that someone else would consider adopting her. When we shot @ CAPS1 in the lady said we also had a back. After the paperwork we had to wait another week because they had to fix it. My mom went shopping at a dog store they told us we can pick him up on @ DATE2. We were so excited. Instead of @ DATE2, we thought we could get it back on @ DATE1. On @ DATE1 we got it back @ CAPS1 took @ NUM2 years of patience for my sister and only @ NUM3 years for me. A year later, we returned to adopt or simply look for another dog. We did not find any, but we have waited and whether your patient will offer you anything for it. We are always patient to maybe have another dog if our parents allow @ CAPS1.
I am patient at school most of the time. When I don't understand something and my teacher or someone else is busy, I will wait that long. I need them, until they're alone helping someone else. In all of my classes, I am patient most of the time. In art class we made a clay box and I was a little late because I had finished my project which had to be done the previous week, so when I started working on my box, I did everything I could remember from the art teacher's demonstration. It was the beginning. So when I needed help I asked a friend who was done if he would help me catch up, they said yes so I was getting help from them. When someone else asked for help. So she helped when. I cried, it took about the whole hour but, I cried and I was patient with them. At the end of the hour, they still weren't done, so she said she would help me for the next few days. I said okay, then I said, I'll see them the next day. The next day in art @ PERSON1 helped me out and when she took a break or worked on her own thing I did my best and waited patiently for her to help me again. @ PERSON1 was almost done with her gift but I was still waiting so I asked someone else until she finished her project. Finally, when she was done, she helped me with the rest of my boy. At the end of the hour I'm done with it. Then we started a new project the next day which was simple. It is not the only time but it is the longest time that I have been patient with someone.
I can't really tell you about a time when I was patient because that something that I struggle with, no matter how much I try to be patient, it just seems impossible, but it doesn't may not be the case. I'm not trying hard enough, who knows. An example of my impatience is that I am in a store and I have five dollars and something I want is ten dollars that I will not save for the ten dollar item. I'm going to turn around and most likely buy some candy. My parents try to take my money and hide it so that I can't spend it but I always end up finding it and spending it because he doesn't want to and until they return it to me most of the time. time. I am grounded but the article is worth it because I get candy. Another example is when I want to do something and my mom says no, I always hide it and get in trouble. @ NUM1 words.
Patience is being able to wait for something. For some, patience is difficult and for some it is easy. For me, I agree with patience. How patient I am for this game that I pre-ordered. It comes out @ DATE1. When I'm not patient, that's when I want me to log into the computer. I was also patient to get my second class rank, well that's all I have to say about patience.
One time I was patient was when I was getting my injections. It was just me and my dad. I had to get the vaccine because I was sick. It was still cold outside because it was @ DATE1. We went to @ ORGANIZATION1 for kids. At first I was at home preparing to leave. I put on an orange turtleneck and jeans with sneakers. I didn't want to go because it was after @ CAPS1 and I had a lot of new games. It took us @ NUM1 minutes to arrive. My dad filled in the information and then we sat down. In the middle, we start to watch TV. I was really bored because they were nothing but informants. They made us wait over an hour. I am starting to feel hungry and very upset. They finally called our name. In the end, it was time to get my shot. The nice lady gave me a juice. Then she told me that I was receiving photos @ NUM2. I got my photos which took a long time I was frustrated I got my photos before I left they told me I would come back for more photos. I was still hungry so we got @ CAPS2.Donalds. In conclusion, I was very patient when taking my pictures. The information I received was as painful as receiving my injections. They made us wait a very long time. I was sad to have to wait but glad it was over.
I have known patients when I went to @ LOCATION1 @ LOCATION1. It was a bunch of hours @ NUM1, we were in a small car and we were a bit caradable because we didn't sleep very well last night even though I brought a book and my game @ ORGANIZATION1 us we were still bored enough. Everything I did I looked at the trees after my drums ran out on my @ ORGANIZATION1. Dad was seen on the road, mom finally and the license plates to see travelers. Once he entered @ LOCATION2 I started to fall asleep but @ CAPS1 kept me awake because she had just finished it and was explaining everything. So I started to read my book. Even though you could hear, Mom, @ CAPS1 and my stomach growl, we didn't stop. We had to get to @ LOCATION1 before @ NUM2 pm as that was when the hotel reception was closed. At @ NUM3 we were walking through the state of @ LOCATION1 and then arriving at @ TIME1 at the hotel, we were so excited we fell asleep in @ NUM4 minutes in bed.
What does it mean to be patient? It means that; “You are understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulty without complaining. @ CAPS1, being a patient person is difficult. Once it was difficult for me to be a patient person, I didn't complain though. I was delighted to go to a water park on my birthday. I wanted to party and swim, but it was almost in NUM1 weeks. I didn't want to wait any longer, but I knew that being patient would make my experience even better. I was tolerant, understanding and patient. The week dragged on. I wanted to complain and pull my hair out because it felt like the earth was spinning @ NUM2, @ NUM3 times slower, but I knew I couldn't! When the thought that I was going to the water park stuck in my brain like glue, the problem was clear. If I didn't think about it, the time would pass again. I had to be patient because I didn't want to annoy anyone with my complaints. When the day came, I had a blast. Being patient always feels good!
Be patient. Being patient is good and bad. Good things have happened to me. I @ CAPS1 that I had to do was be patient. Here are some good things that are happening to me. One time I was patient was when I was trying to be a part of my dance studio's dance team. I was so cloudy that I never tried anything before. I had to wait and wait and wait for my dance studio to call my mom. One day when I was at a friend's house my mom called me and said "@ CAPS2 you were on the dance team." I was so happy. I couldn't wait to learn a new dance. Then I got to see everyone at my dance competitions. It will be so much fun. Another time I was patient was when I broke my arm. I had to be really patient. I had to be very careful with my arm. I had it in a cast and then waited to take it off. Now I have no more plaster. I was so patient that the doctor said it healed and I didn't need a cast anymore. If you are patient, better things will come.
I once went to @ CAPS1 world and we were waiting around @ NUM1 hours to start this rude stupid. I was them because I had my @ ORGANIZATION1 so I played it, but for an hour I got bored. I took it out on my sisters and that was seeing them get angry. Then I got bored with it so I just sat on the road.
In my own words, patience is when you just need to be calm and quiet. And not all of them hyper and boring. Patience is just controlling yourself. And don't be rude and disrespectful to others.
One day, I was at my sister's football game. My mom dropped us off at the game because she had to go to work. When I got out of the car she asked if I had my money with me. I said no then she said you're just gonna be hungry. I said @ CAPS1. @ CAPS2 when the game starts. I'm really hungry. @ CAPS2 I checked all my packages, it just happened that @ CAPS2 found @ NUM1 dollars. @ CAPS2 I went to see the length of the line. It was @ CAPS2 a long time it was almost in the street. @ CAPS2 I sat down trying to shorten the line. But the line had gotten much longer @ CAPS2 I ran in the line. I must have stood in line for about @ NUM2 minutes. @ CAPS2 when I finally got out of line I stood by the door and watched my sister clap. @ CAPS2, she came to see us and asked me to leave fries for her @ CAPS3. I said no because the line was too long. @ CAPS2 she said please ! @ CAPS2 I got back online and it moved a lot slower. When I came back she said, what took your time at @ CAPS2. I said look at the line. @ CAPS2 is one of the times I was patient.
I think patience is like someone or someone waiting for someone to come out of the bathroom so the other person can go to the bathroom. As i am not in patience because i want to go to a store now but they said wait for your patience. All my family are not patient but my friends are.
One time I was patient was on the @ LOCATION1 car ride. It was a @ DATE1 hour car ride but I stayed patient, didn't complain. Most kids would say we're already there, but I didn't. Also, when I had hungry supper, I sat there and didn't complain. Finally @ DATE1 we got there. It was a time when I was patient.
One day I was told we were going to @ LOCATION1. We got there by this big, fast boat called the Jet Express. So we had to wait in this big line. The boat was delayed so we were told it would be late. I know I didn't dress warmly and it was very cold. We were the first people in line so it was a thing to do, but I was patient, not complaining or anything. When the boat finally arrived I was so relieved and my mom also thanked me for being patient and not complaining. It turned out to be a very pleasant and fun day.
When my friend was taking his meds, I waited for him to be ready, I sat down to wait for him. I got down my phone loud @ PERSON2 ping pong and lift. I was looking for @ PERSON1 and waiting for him to finish.
One day @ DATE1 my uncle took me to point @ CAPS1 to go on a @ CAPS2 roll, the @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. The queue was so long we waited at least @ NUM1 hours. Time passed slowly and we finally got along. After we went to the thrill @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6, which took about an hour and a half.
Patience. "@ CAPS1" @ CAPS4 the stomach was growling. "@ CAPS2 I'm hungry" I cried then @ CAPS12 stopped at @ ORGANIZATION2, because @ CAPS8 was on the way home. Moments later, @ CAPS8 finally made it to the reader of @ ORGANIZATION2. The cashier said "hi @ MONTH1 I'm taking your @ CAPS3." @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 shouted "@ CAPS5 I get a famous bowl and a piece of honey @ NUM1 @ CAPS6 wings." The lady @ CAPS7 "@ MONEY2 @ NUM2 first window." @ CAPS8 drove to the first window @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 saves the lady from an invoice @ MONEY1, @ CAPS12 gave her @ MONEY3 and said "@ MONEY3 is your change, go to the second window." @ CAPS9 @ CAPS8 could drive up to the second window @ CAPS8 had to wait in the car in front of us. @ CAPS8 sat there for @ MONEY1 minutes and they finally left. Then @ CAPS8 walked over to the second window and waited. @ CAPS13 minutes later @ CAPS8 was still waiting. So after @ MONEY1 minutes. I said "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS8 go get @ ORGANIZATION1" @ CAPS12 calmly @ CAPS7 "@ CAPS10, @ CAPS8 will sit here patiently." I mumbled "but I'm starving". @ CAPS8 sat there and waited patiently for over an hour. I ask once again "@ CAPS5 @ CAPS8 please go." @ CAPS12 said "@ CAPS10 I paid for the food and I will get it." @ CAPS13 minutes later @ CAPS8 finally got the food after two hours. After sitting there @ CAPS8 received free food. Even though @ CAPS8 got free food, I'm still pissed that @ CAPS8 stayed there all this time.
It was a scorching day @ DATE1 where I decided to go mountain biking @ CAPS1 I but on my helmet, boots, goggles and gloves. I walked to the door and got out to my dirt bike, started it and took off. Like a quick ' zoom ' I got up one of the ramps and landed but was going to speed up into a corner and ' wam ' I fell and the foot went into my leg. My dad ran up to get me and put me in the truck to go to @ CAPS2. When we arrived my dad had to check in after which we were seated. There were a lot of people there, men, women, children and babies. An hour passed and we were still sitting there, then two more and then finally they called my name. the nurse took my dad and I to a room and said "the doctor will be in a little while." “ Very good, ” replied my father. An hour passed without a doctor. We were starting to have the edge @ CAPS1 my dad turned on the TV. Then finally at three o'clock after we entered the room the doctor came in now it was @ NUM1 pm and we were exostids. The doctor took me for an x-ray when we got back, the doctor said I rubbed my bone and pounded me and said not to do it for a week. When we got home I lay down on the sofa and fell asleep right away. This was the time when I was patient for six hours in the @ CAPS2.
One time I was patient was when I was waiting to get into my basketball game, I was playing for the destroyer. So in all games I always had to wait for @ DATE2. So in the @ DATE1 game of the season, I participated four times. In the first @ DATE2 I walked in for about a minute. the I entered for @ NUM1 minutes in the @ DATE1. I was happy but I still did not start. then we got into the playoffs which i only had in two minutes the whole game. At one point I was going to stop, but my teammate came up to me and said don't worry, you'll start with everyone. Over the next few months, I waited patiently. Then we went to tournaments and then we split the team with older people on one side and younger people on the other. Then I finally got into the starting XI. I was so excited to have made the playoffs and then we lost in the championship game. It was a time when I was patient.
Patient help has passed through your life. If you are not patient, you will not know where to go in the future. @ Uncle CAPS4 must have been patient for a month. He was just throwing a shit @ CAPS5 for a phone call. Finally someone shouted, be patient, they will call. He told us that being patient was the hardest thing to do. He had dinner why they couldn't call the next day. He said ended up forgetting here and there. He said he was trying to be as patient as possible. @ CAPS4 under was expecting a patient ??? America's Next @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. They added him that they would call him if he entered. They quickly did it because the phone was assaulting. A woman kindly said "@ MONTH1 I speak with sanders @ CAPS3 please" @ CAPS4 uncle replied "yes that's him! I have @ CAPS5 for a month! The @ CAPS4 family kept on going to tell me to be patient! So now I haven't lifted anymore! " " There you are ! So keep training ! Someone else will call you to give you the details ! " " @ CAPS6, you are so "then he hung up the phone," I'm in! " @ CAPS7 has been the happiest day of our lives. @ CAPS4 uncle with a lot of stuff. In reality, all that kept him down was his patience. He told us that @ CAPS7 was difficult but @ CAPS7 worked fine and the end. Here are the future tips. Always and I mean always be patient. You won't get anywhere in your life if you aren't. The patient is an important @ CAPS8 in your life.
A time when I was patient was when I counted. I didn't just count to ten, I counted a shipment of coins consisting of pennies, nickel, dimes, quarters and more. It took me two hours to finish counting my money, it was like forever. Counting lots of coins won't change the world, but it does take a lot of patience. I still remember when I finished counting the money. I was proud of myself and couldn't think I could make it as I admit being a very impatient person. Patience is important because nothing would ever be finished without it. I don't think I will be able to count my coins again, but as they say, " Patience is a virtue ".
Sitting in the car waiting for @ CAPS2 mom to get out of the house and get in the car. When she got in the car, we were gone. On our way to the ??? For the @ CAPS1 party I got pretty bored after about a few minutes, when I got out of Midland I thought it would pass really fast but I was wrong it was slower than ever. which made it worse was that small @ CAPS2 sisters screaming in back.So we stoped a witch felt like forever.I station preety much never talked all the way there - there that I was trying to be patient but I do it could take it. I managed to calm down after about an hour of girl-to-girl screaming. They finally fall asleep . It was probably like @ NUM1 minutes ago when the girls finally woke up. They started screaming “Are we there yet?” @ CAPS2 mom and dad keep saying “@ CAPS3” happened on hat day. Thought I was preety patient on the way back but on the way back I could ju st sleep. At the party I was patient until we could open the presents I panicked. I hope next time none of this will happen.
It is difficult to be patient. First of all, it's like waiting in a ??? a and line that could take forever. It can take a long time to be patient on this line, but it can go by quickly if you have something to do. You can bring a book to read and read as you go, or be patient and ???.
Once, when I was patient, I got to a place that I still love to go to. This place is called @ CAPS1 point. I always look forward to this place and once we get there I am very excited. A small inconvenience to this place is called waiting. Another word would be be patient. To be patient is to wait for someone or something. You have to be patient everywhere at point @ CAPS1 as on the way, to find a campsite, and also in the queues. But in the end, it's all worth it because there is a lot of fun in being patient.
I remember when I went to @ ORGANIZATION1 and saw a little girl who was patient. When I got to @ ORGANIZATION1 I was so excited because it was my first time going to @ ORGANIZATION1. It was so colorful and loud. I did a few rides and got hungry so my family and I went for some cotton candy. I was eating my food when I saw a cute little girl. She stood in a line like a small angle. All of a sudden I saw a bunch of teenagers cut themselves in front of the little girl. She was so patient that she stood right behind the teens cutting in front of her. The queue grew in a matter of minutes. I went for walks and when I came back the poor little one was still there. More and more people had cut in front of her but she said nothing. All she did was mumble to herself. I couldn't stand it! I wondered how she could just let them cut like that. If I were that little girl, I would have lost my patience @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 some time ago. I was so amazed at the patience she had. She finally rose to the front line and @ CAPS3! The closed sign came out. I couldn't believe my eyes, she didn't even get mad. I watched until the end. She finally made her way to the @ ORGANIZATION2 and @ CAPS4 booths and did the exact same thing! I couldn't watch it anymore. I left with my family and thought of this girl. In the end, I hoped to have great patience like her just thinking of her surprises me!
I know a time when I was patient. My friend @ PERSON1 was coming back to the football field after getting a grant @ NUM1. We were going to hang out. It took two and a half hours before he got theirs. When he was there we were both patients playing the game or doing whatever others wanted to do. As the day wore on, the sun looked like a tanning booth. The grass was as dry as cacti, but the day was getting on. Finally, when we went, our own way. We knew we had patience.
Once, while I was patient, my friend @ PERSON1 went to the mall around @ NUM1 in the morning. @ CAPS2 was supposed to buy new school clothes. When @ CAPS2 arrived the sun was really shining in the sky, the birds were chirping and it was as hot as a day @ DATE1. When @ CAPS2 were both walking, hardly anyone was there but @ CAPS2 went to a store called ???, there were so many people I thought I was at a concert. @ CAPS2 had to wait in the longest queue, it was so long that people were almost at the gates. So @ CAPS2 waited and waited. Finally @ CAPS2 was at the head of the line and the cashier said “@ CAPS1 you have probably waited in the long queue for about @ NUM2 hours. I'll give you a @ PERCENT1 discount folks. @ CAPS2 went shopping and @ CAPS2 was rewarded for their patience.
A time when I was patient was the last @ DATE1 when I went to point @ CAPS1. I was about to queue to ride the @ CAPS2. I was begging to the line and then saw a sign that @ CAPS3 was waiting two hours from that point. But I wasn't that close to the sign, so for me and my family and the other people who were in the same place as us, we probably had to wait at least two and a half hours. Well it was a hot day and I was wearing black which probably wasn't the smartest @ CAPS4. So I stood in line for only about an hour, I just couldn't stand standing in the hot weather anymore, but I really wanted to rivet this rine so all I could do was wait another hour and to be patent so I was about @ NUM1 minutes into the ride then the queue looked like people had left for me it was a good cause so I was in the front and j was glad I had been patient enough to wait so long. It is a line that I was paitent.
One day at @ CAPS1 I had to sit for two hours because I had to come and remove my stitches. And it's got a lot of people, we're staying there for a very long time because there was only @ NUM1 doctors and this lady took so long. So it was my turn to come in but I had the scar that it hurt but then it was okay and it didn't hurt for nothing. And then I went home.
Some time ago my best friend @ PERSON1's grandfather passed away. They were not related by blood but they were very close. At the funeral I saw @ PERSON1 and his sister @ CAPS1 forcing us to smile. @ CAPS1 went to talk to my parents. Then @ PERSON1 started to cry, that she would not see her grandfather's gravestone because they were moving to @ LOCATION1. She was changing the subject, on the good times she spent with her grandfather. I laughed and smiled with @ PERSON1. My parents later said we had to go to church. I gave her a hug and told her everything would be fine. She smiled, ”a lot of opposites. "@ PERSON1's eyes filled with tears," I don't want to move to @ LOCATION1. "@ CAPS2 weeks later she did it with her family.
My to say that your patient is. Your patient when you stand in line for something is patient. Waiting for your turn is to be patient once, I was patient while waiting on the bench to play but I couldn't play until the fourth queiter with @ NUM1 but you know what I did , I had patience. A lot of people have patience, but some people just don't have a way when they don't care and start screaming and screaming. Like popstars, a lot of popstars and other famous people think they can cut in front of anyone because their rich, but if they weren't rich they would cut pop stars and movie stars have just need to have patience. I'm not saying all popstars and movie stars didn't have patience when they were little, they never act like that.
I was patient when my mother goes to the store, she will go to the store and look for a basket, she will take all day in this store, she will come out of this store with a full basket to the basket I will be patient then she will go in a new store do again
When my family once went to @ LOCATION1, we all had to be patient. There is a merry-go-round where you climb up a log and then sit down and it takes you up a hill. You wait to get to the top, then you hurtle down a hill. Well this was one of everyone's favorite rides so there was a long line. We had to wait half an hour to ride it once. So, to do something, you need time, so you have to be patient. If you are not patient, you will probably want to do what you wanted to do.
Patience is the ability to be tolerant, understanding, and to face difficulties without complaint. Patience is not something you are taught at my school. There is no book you must read called patience @ NUM1, there is no movie called patience is the key. None of this exists, even if you live in a world where a necklace can be turned into a camera, or a cell phone is a gun. I just got my first undercover mission and it's not at all what I expected. So far all I've done is sit on a cold bench next to the dynamometer at a county fair. What people really don't understand is the patience it takes to be a spy. Of course there is an occasional car that explodes, not today, not for me. I have the clock here in my hand so " Tic, tac, tac, tac ". @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2, there is action. Subject (The person I am monitoring is on the move and, oh, too bad, all the subject has done is put away a three dollar bag of popcorn. I start to scribble a picture in the dirt, with my foot. I'm about to cancel the mission. Seeing that nothing happens when all of a sudden I find a clue. There in the dirt right in front of me. see a tiny computer chip. I pick it up and spray it with my finger to print a telltale mist. A fluffy purple cloud of vapor surrounds the chip. Of course, when the purple cloud disappears. I see the subject's fingerprints are on the chip, I take out my laptop to insert the computer chip. @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 are the words that stay on the computer screen like I refuse to leave. I sit there waiting bored. I remember patience. I tell myself that if I am able to defeat twelve armed robers with nothing but 'a tablecloth, I'm sure I can sit here and be patient. At least twenty minutes have passed now, but I feel like I have twenty hours. The computer is still writing on the screen, @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1 was successful. "@ CAPS2 !" I say out loud and people start to look at me, but I don't mind. I click on the square on the screen that says “ open ”. @ CAPS3 a little message opens that says "@ CAPS4 me to the pallor of ice cream." I close my laptop and start to walk slowly towards the ice cream truck, observing everyone and everything around me. A man wearing a yellow shirt and a lady wearing a purple scarf on her head are the only two people standing near the ice cream stand. I approach a little closer and realize that the man has a gun. I pull mine out and with a few loud roars they were both handcuffed of course they were both working with the prime suspect. I could never have completed my mission without being patient.
I remember a time when I was patient. I was so patient that the doctor gave me a suction cup. I was patient because the doctor was looking for a needle to stick in my arm. He told me to wait a second, but I didn't wait a second, I waited hours. My mom couldn't wait any longer, she was about to take me home. I told her to be patient and it would fill up like time was passing faster. She said she was going to try, but if it didn't work she was leaving. She waited patiently and the next thing you know, the doctor came back into the room and said thank you for being patient. He was still looking for the needle and then came back into the room and said I had found it. It was in the other doctor's room over the sink on the dresser, after I got my bite the doctor thanked me and my mom for being patient and not being gone. after thanking me he gave me, he gave me a sucker and shook my hand. My mom and I left and went to the store and had something to eat.
So you want a story about patience and scarcity. So the story begins with me at the doctor's office so I wait. I was going to sit here for a few hours so @ NUM1 @ CAPS1 I'm going to read something. So I'm reading and all I'm here is screaming oho wine so I ??? no Yes. But not crazy. I make the kid stop crying and mom stop screaming, so I was happy. There, my dear sister arrives and yells in my ear, I was really pissed off but not angry so I just had another one ??? then my mom says it will be another hour. I was so angry that I screamed. It's true and I was pre-patient
I was patient when whey was going to lunch and I held their pay and we had or had lunch and avir @ CAPS1 was patient so wan we had or had lunch and I don't have a time when my fraed was patient for wan we were in the water fouten to obtain water and gray cam until the water fault to obtain water. He waet patient.
Without patience, a person can be very easily broken. Without patience, a person can be easily set off by something horrible like me. I have patience, but sometimes I don't have patience for a while. Without patience the whole world is out of control so most of the business ventures are trying to hate out there ??? as first as possible. While it was all patience.
When I was patient, I remember writing an article on Sea World when I was very little. I didn't complain because I knew I would have it sometimes my sister complained of being in a bad mood. We stood in line for @ NUM1 minutes for a role called @ CAPS1 drop, or something that I can't remember. Then there was a line at ??? for ???. We waited @ NUM2 minutes plus time for everyone to exit.
I once had to be so patient for a plane to come. We were up at dawn and had to wait for @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 hours. During @ DATE1 hiatus a few years ago me and my family when at @ LOCATION1. We thought about it a lot during our stay. When we had to get home, we had to look for a plain. We got up early to be able to pack our bags and get to the airport. When we got there we had to be patient as we re-checked the rental car and went through security. When we got access to security, we had to do anything for the plain to arrive. We sat for over an hour before the plain entered. When the plain arrived we had to do anything to get the plain cleaned up, the passes checked and everyone was bored. It was then that I had to be patient. And I have been patient for a very long time.
A while ago when I took a trip to Cedar Point at @ LOCATION1 it took a 1.5 hour drive @ DATE1 to get there, the reason we went was because of my dad's job @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. I stayed out of the car with ??? @ NUM1, wait for my suaisn family , wait was all I did until @ DATE1 burst out running in the park my dad points out the height limits (I only had @ NUM2 and "4. @ NUM2 "ft @ CAPS2 I was not tall enough for most of the rides @ CAPS4 my dad saw I was tall enough for the @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6. We are walking around looking for the ride and most importantly of his line. attention was drawn from the ride to the line, my mouth hit the ground with the expression "@ CAPS7 chance to get to this ride", my dad looked at me as my sister "where is mum and will be? ”I pointed my finger at by the fare being of course covard. So we just stood in line and signed, it was at least @ NUM4 degrees. We waited almost two hours and are finally got to the front we sat on the chair and a bar came up to us, I remember one thing put a quarter on your leg and gravity grabs it. nute @ CAPS8 we descend like a netour the quarter does not float @C APS9 ! At that split second, we were on dry land now, the ride wasn't really worth the wait, but hey, I'm not a covard.
During @ DATE1 my sister and I were going to go to the werewolf lodge with cosine grace and ancul rege. But then he had to resceganal because his plain was going to be late. Then he had to rescegunal decas his brock bown car. Then we hired a car. Then we had to pick up my uncle @ PERSON1 and we had a one way ticket. On one way, we were stopped by a cop and the cop gave us a speeding ticket. We finally arrived and it was the best two days of my life.
The story I'm about to tell you is screaming at the patients where a boy and his father went fishing and the boy is not patient. One day a boy and his father went fishing when they got there, put the corn in the water and said their trip was that the boy was not patient and he was doing of cunoking. So far, he didn't count anything when he got home, next to his father came and said "Sun, if you cost anything before you fish, it would be killing, not fishing". @ CAPS1 they went out the next day and since the boy was patient he listened to music on the left ie @ CAPS2 because he was patient. Well see what happened with the boy he cut a fish @ CAPS2 because patients remember "all good things happen now, that's patient!"
My mother is in the hospital! My mother was in the hospital! She was going to have a life-threatening operation. It is the story of a time when I was from a time when I was patient. My mom didn't feel well for two years. And when she turned to doctors for a " punch " it turned out that she was suffering from heart disease at NUM1 ages from the main artery block. So I had to wait for it to “get ready”. It took two hours, which seemed like an eternity! Then I was able to see her for five minutes, then she had to be taken to the operating room. The operation lasted five hours. I sat in the waiting room after school. I did my homework and read magizens. I was very worried about my mother. But then the doctor comes in and says no one can see her for a whole day! I had to be patient and wait until the next day. It was the time when I had patients and it paid off.
There was a boy who wanted to go to the gym so when he got there he had to give it a try. But he wanted a basketball player. As he dressed, other boys came out first and took the ball. Later when he came out he saw that they had it. So when he got over it, he was crazy and got the better of them. After the incident he came and gave it to them and said "I can wait." So when they finished he got it, he was so happy and proud that he finally got the basketball. When he got home he told @ CAPS1 mom and she said she was happy because he was finally patient. He asked, "what is it?" @ CAPS1 mom said "it's one thing when you understand and tolerant. The boy was very happy because he always took things and now he can wait to use something to be happy. This boy now lives happily with it @ CAPS1's mom in high school who patiently advances to the end.
One time I was patient was yesterday when I finished @ CAPS1 in front of a lot of people and drew for the next @ NUM1 minutes. I was patient throughout this time around because if it wasn't I might have been very loud and disturbing my classmates. I started drawing or coloring as some would say because instead of drawing a smiley face, I colored boxes on mathematical graph paper to make a kind of lime green and purple checkerboard. It took all the time and I'm still not done. It's a time I remember when I was quite patient.
Once I was a patient, it was at the doctor's, because when I was little and I was at the doctor's I ran around and didn't take care of it. I guess this time my mom didn't trust me so she sat with me wherever I went. Beware there were some girls around so I was embarrassed and I asked mum why you are following me and she replied because I don't want you running around. That when I told her mother that I was older now, I was not only a few years old, I became mute. She said @ CAPS1 is moving forward so I sat down next to a few girls and talked to them. That's when we got up and started walking around talking. I felt a little tingle in my head saying "your mom is still following you so I turned around and she wasn't there. So we went to the snack bar and we sat down, we ate and stuff, and I happened to look over and my mom was sitting at the third table away from us. That's when we got back in the elevator back to our home location and we sat down and to my surprise she was all ready there. That's when I told the girl that I would be back and I sat down next to my mom and said " were you following me and she said yes i mean no. so I had a conversation with her and we hit it off. Soon it was my turn to go see the doctor. This is the end of my story.
On time i was paid when my brother was driving fast i had to wait and wait for my brother to finish but he said i couldn't get on but i told him i was so i wait and i'm waiting but i had been driving him for hours finally he had taken it out of the gear and said now you can ride it. Now and I said my cool,
Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. Also a person who experiences difficulty without complaining. Once I was patient, it was when my little sister was born. I was patient then because I had to wait until she was born and then I could become a big sister. My little sister was supposed to be born on @ DATE1 twenty seconds. My mom wasn't even sweating that day. I thought she would be ready to go get her bags (which she packed the night before) and ready to have the baby. I certainly was. A week and two days later, my mother gave birth and was ready to give birth to my little sister. I have been patient during those nine days of waiting. I waited patiently in the waiting room with my dad and big brother until the nurse came out and said we could enter the room. When I saw the faces of my little sisters, I almost started to cry. I knew I was going to love her and that she would be as patient as I was.
I am part of the Sea Cadet Corps @ LOCATION3 @ CAPS1. We were driving in a truck that could hold five people, we put @ NUM2 people in it, I was the one stuck in the back with all the guts. Some sea bags contained a boat that was stabilizing in my back. I tried so hard not to complain about it, it took all my patience to go halfway until I had to move the trunk to my bay. who had the boot in and there the spirit on the other side. When I thought everything was fine and @ @ CAPS2 LOCATION1 began to sigh on a very boring song, I thought not my patient could bear to remain in the torch with her sighs. Finally, we were at the port @ LOCATION2. @ CAPS2 and @ LOCATION1 stop sighing and my patience has held up. But then there was the online cheating, there were @ NUM3 people in @ CAPS3 waiting to verify that I felt like my patience was going to explode and I was going to go crazy. But I didn't stay there patiently until it was the turn of the check-in, unfortunately the agent at the check-in desk was old and spoke very slowly, it was so hard to understand what he was saying . I was finally verified that my patience had survived !! Then I found out that my friend's connection was built up. Which it can be very boring. @ CAPS4 boy I thought, "here is another test for my patience. My patience was tested throughout the ace ride, the clean in line, and also throughout this training. But my patience was very strong and survived !!!
@ CAPS3 was about @ NUM1 an hour's drive from Freedom Hill and we had just left our house. Dad, mom, @ CAPS1 and I were going to see a buddy and @ CAPS3 was going to be a @ NUM1 and 1.5 hour concert. As we pulled into the parking lot the police guard pointed to the open parking spot for the jeep and we entered @ CAPS3. We went out and drank pop and ate sand as we had about an hour before the gig started. After @ NUM3 minutes, or maybe @ NUM4 minutes, we bought our tickets and found a place to sit on the hill. Once we were seated time stopped, I waited and waited until I think @ NUM5 minutes have passed. I expected my friend to take the stage anytime, but @ CAPS2 never did. After what looked like @ NUM6 minutes to me, I hit my dad with my elbow and asked him "how long has @ CAPS3 been since we sat down?" "about five minutes." @ CAPS2 responded. @ CAPS2 must be lying to me, I thought so I tried again. "How long?" “ Six now. ” @ CAPS3 wouldn't have been surprising if I died right there. I tried to fall asleep to pass the time, but it was just too much noise. Minute after minute, someone took the stage. “ The performance will start in @ NUM7 minutes. " @ CAPS2 announced. @ CAPS3 was heartbreaking. The wait was only half over. Finally, after @ NUM7 minutes of death and waiting, @ CAPS2 took the stage. @ CAPS3 was the best view in the world. @ CAPS3 was worth a long, long wait and I enjoyed @ CAPS3 even more. We did for the rest of the night.
A time when I am patient is gymnastics. There are many ways to be patient in gymnastics. Your mind and body need to be patient, and sometimes you need to be patient with the coach. Your mind should be patient when you want to do things but really can't. your body should be patient when it feels ready to do a skill, but your mind is telling you to stop and be patient. You have to be patient with the coaches because they always help. So sometimes you have to wait @ NUM1 minutes until they can finally help you. Patience is a very important life skill that everyone should have.
When I was in the Universal Studios and waiting in the long lines to get on the rides, I was patient. It took a while but I never got angry or impatient. My dad and I were in line for this dragon roller coaster ride that we were so close to being next that it started to rain and light up. A lot of people left so we ended up at the front of the line. We waited another hour or two but it never stopped. We forgot about my mom and my brothers so we left. I have been patient the whole time. We went to line up for one of the new rides they had just received and since it was new the queue was long. We waited a while. We eventually got on the ride and realized it was worth the wait so we went back.
When I was @ NUM1 I went to my first doctor's appointment it was extremely annoying. I sat in a chair next to my mom, shaping, constantly asking myself for @ NUM2. I was running around and when I finally sat down I said, "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 !! I couldn't be patient with anyone. So he walked out the door, when the nerve called the next one." And I was like "well, that wasn't long, just about @ NUM3 and a ½," @ CAPS4 it's only @ NUM4 and we got here at @ TIME1 "@ CAPS5 it wasn't long, ”my mother said. The next time I go to the doctor, I will be even more patient.
Being patient means being understanding and tolerant. A patient person experiences difficulty without complaining. I am writing about a time when my friend @ PERSON1 was patient. "@ CAPS1" @ PERSON1 told @ ORGANIZATION1 as he left to spend all of his @ DATE1 in the top pininusula of @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ PERSON1 had been dating since the start of the year. She was sad @ CAPS2 weeks had passed and @ CAPS4 was the start of a new school year. She had been patient all @ DATE1 @ CAPS3 to see him again. Finally the first day of school arrived she jumped over to him and he @ CAPS3 called a path. Confused few weeks late, she told him are you hopping on me or ??? He thought about @ CAPS4 for a long time. She had been patient while waiting for a response @ CAPS4 never came. Finally, she decided to jump on him, but she never did. So @ CAPS5 gabby and I did it. @ CAPS4 away from her outside she was angry but inside she was probably screaming today she has "moved" and is now dating a boy named @ PERSON2.
There was a day when I was awesome ???. I did everything slowly for which I redy myself ??? slow I walked slowly I spoke slowly. My mom was very patient with me, all she did was make me move faster, she tried to motivate me and help me get ready for school, she tried to motivate me. brought my breakfast and put all my books on my back. I thanked her all the end of the day for being so patient with me. It was the day someone was patient with me.
For @ CAPS4, being patient means not waiting if you've ordered something and it takes a long time to get to you. This is what children do. I have been patient many times in my life, but only one occurred to me when I thought of patience. A @ TIME1 I woke up at @ TIME1 to go take pictures for our passports. @ CAPS7 thought @ CAPS8 wasn't going to be a bush out there. The boys got it wrong @ CAPS7. @ CAPS7 started to dress. By the time @ CAPS7 was made, the clock reached @ NUM1. @ CAPS7 got in the car and @ CAPS7 was on the way. @ CAPS4 and my little brother turned up the music and started singing, I @ CAPS1 YOUR @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. My parents got so mad and made us stop singing by turning off the music. mom as our favorite song. @ CAPS5 our @ CAPS6.PS. Says "you have reached your destination. Finally, @ CAPS8 was getting a bit embellished here. @ CAPS7 walked into the waiting room, @ CAPS5 @ CAPS7 almost passed out from the number of people. " Just let yourself calm down, I mean how many @ CAPS8 long will it take for a serious voice in my head telling me : " @ NUM2 hours later . " My brother decided to place a bet with @ CAPS4. “@ CAPS8 you don't fall for @ CAPS5 it's your turn to take the pictures I'll do anything for you whenever you want for a week. You yourself have an agreement. @ CAPS8 took a while to go @ NUM3 overtime and I was about to scream. I then fell deeper and a sleep @ CAPS5, family @ PERSON1 your next. " The man had a long white beard and glasses. @ CAPS7 finally entered and ended with @ CAPS8. " @ CAPS10 I win @ CAPS11! I won the bet, with a big smile on my face @ CAPS12 you have to do whatever I want ". I was so happy I started doing my victory dance, while the man with the glasses and the beard looked @ CAPS4 like I was a maniac. @ CAPS7 took our picture and @ CAPS7 was off. Patient means to wait and wait without complaining. Everyone should be patient in their life, just like @ CAPS4
During @ DATE1 my dad, brother and I went to point @ CAPS1. It was really hot but we didn't care, we really wanted to ride the Millennium Force. We found the merry-go-round but first looked at the line it was huge. It shook almost twice the whole way, so we got to the end of the line and sat in the scorching sun for half an hour until we found ourselves covered in a tent that 'they came up, so that was kinda cool online. So we waited longer and longer until my brother started screaming and screaming at the top of his lungs : "I can't wait here anymore" @ CAPS2 he went under the ?? and ?? disabled. My dad told me to stand in line as he ran after him. So I waited an hour when finally it was time for me to get on the ride but my dad and brother weren't there so I decided to wait in the queue in front of the ride. When I got on they still weren't there, and well the ride took off and it wasn't the best ride of my life.
My dad is in @ ORGANIZATION1. He goes away for long periods of time. The only time he comes to visit us is at @ DATE1, near my birthday. But one year my dad couldn't come home when he was supposed to. He sent us a letter saying that they were guarding all the soldiers for an additional six months. I felt depressed the longest. But then I thought about it. Even though it had been delayed, he still came back with hope. So I decided to be patient rather than disappointed. Our family sent her a care packager. Finally, he came back. It was a difficult time, but she was patient and I thought about it.
When it comes to patience, you need to be relaxed. You have to be patient when doing the doctor. When you get to the doctor, you will always have finished exercising patience. When you get home you will be patient for someone. So remember to be patient in everything
To the diet to write at a time when I was a pacifist. Once we went to @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION2. My family and I were eager to go to @ ORGANIZATION3. But the line was huge. I was the only one who could participate in @ ORGANIZATION3. Because I'm in line to go to @ ORGANIZATION3. My family goes on different rides, the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 rid and the @ CAPS3 or even the @ ORGANIZATION1. As I stood in line at the rate wheel @ ORGANIZATION3 @ ORGANIZATION3 and the entertainment house later that was the same day I went to see the star in @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION2 and waited in the queue at the cashier and by the time I had stood up at the cash register, my family was getting a massage. was pachent at @ ORGANIZATION2.
RREEE! The bus stopped. We were finally here! It took a lot of patience for me to stay silent and not cry out to the world. I had to be patient throughout the trip so I had to learn a lot. On @ DATE1, I was with a bunch of other fifth grade comrades. We were all split into groups and unpacked and ready to go for our three day stay at @ ORGANIZATION1. I was so excited that my friends told me to calm down and be patient. I was feeling a little embarrassed @ CAPS4, I didn't care. I finally hung on and kept my cool. In @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2, I was stuck in front of how to do my ??? from @ ORGANIZATION1 and a friend of my group named @ PERSON1 gave me some ideas, @ CAPS4 I wanted to have it @ CAPS4 ??? @ CAPS4 I stayed focused and listened to his ideas and have to say they weren't bad. I thought about ??? from ??? and i used it in my pamting. ??? now we are almost @ NUM1 feet tall ??? ladder I already took my ??? going up and down the awesome gets scary @ CAPS3. I was now helping to keep people at the top of the ladder. I was patient @ CAPS4 man they took forever ! I was about to yell at this guy, @ CAPS4, I was like "be patient". @ CAPS4 this on a kid named @ CAPS5, sometimes he just sat on one of the big word boards. I asked why he was doing this and found their answer hilarious. They said he was trying to be like @ CAPS6 and fly to the top. At the end of the three-day excursion, my patience grew to the size of a spider monkey. And whenever my patience grew to the size of a drop of water, the spider monkey in my head would try to find a way out to knock out the idiot. I learned to be patient with someone, even if they were silly and didn't move fast enough, I would stay calm and make sure I didn't let the spider monkey hit someone where it hurts the most .
One day I was looking at @ CAPS1. I was bored, there was nothing good. So my mom was on the computer. I told her that if I could continue she was fine. In @ NUM1 minutes. I waited until she finished. Ok now you can continue. Thanks Mom. You're welcome. I was very patient. This is the time that I had the patience to go on the computer
Once I was patient, I was a @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS4 ventured ! We were near the water park most of @ CAPS3 and it was fun. It seems clearer to me from my time in @ CAPS5 have the pool and on the @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7- my favoritende.We were quickly getting tired of the water park and decided @ CAPS17 to go to the rides! We were trying to decide whether or not we wanted to continue ??? ??? Or the “@ CAPS8! & @ CAPS9 : - I have decided that @ CAPS5 continue ??? and when we got there @ CAPS5 ??? was like an hour. So i.e. compete with long compound millet and after @ CAPS11 @ CAPS5 have been aligned. Concouontly @ CAPS5 manèges was ??? this??? ??? ??? @ NUM1 getting who announced @ CAPS13 we folded @ CAPS17 go and ??? ??? For @ CAPS5 Thunder @ CAPS15 @ CAPS16 the park was closing “@ CAPS17 bad we stayed in the water park @ DATE1 a long time!” I waited then @ CAPS5 will come back next year and went live and asked my soul mother, @ CAPS18 you can see I experienced parked
Once I had to be patient, it was my birthday. One year my grandfather and grandmother were late for my birthday. I had to wait a few hours. I sat down until they arrived. When they got here we were able to eat cake. After I open my presents. It took them about @ NUM1 hour to get here.
Where here at the point of the cedars. I was so excited I felt like I was going to be cyco " can we go on the dragster first ?" » @ CAPS1 why not it will be fun when we stand in line. It was an estimated one hour wait. “@ CAPS2 do you still want to take the ride”, of course, so I knew I had to be patient before I could ride. While we were waiting it was hot and when I switched to @ NUM1 I felt like it was one o'clock! but I knew when the time was right, patience would pay off. When @ NUM2 minutes passed the dragster was in sight and we were in the second row. Zoom! a car passed, a long blue dragster car pulled up and my name was on it. At @ NUM5 we climbed the hill and it was like a meteorite crashing into the earth. When it was over my patience paid off and @ CAPS4 still patient with the cedar tipped dragster.
I'm writing a story about a time when I was patient. When I was in grade @ NUM1, I went to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 at @ LOCATION1. I ordered with my mom and dad and waited. The waiter said about @ NUM2 minutes. Our food did not arrive after @ NUM2 minutes or @ NUM4 or @ NUM5 or @ NUM6 or even @ NUM7 minutes. Our food arrived after an hour and @ NUM8 minutes. During all the time that I waited, I was more and more hungry. I didn't start complaining or screaming, I just sat in my seat and waited patiently.
When I hurt my hand on the same meaping day, I was patient, I was patient. I fell down the hall and went to the office, patiently waited for them to call my mom. to come and get me. When my mom, she said she was going to take me to the @ CAPS1 room. Took a hard time finding a parking space when we arrived, I was patient even though my hand was sore. We finally found one and then went inside. My mother went to the police office to tell them I was there. We waited a bit, then a nurse came out and went to a room and talked, she said I had to wait for a bed to open for the x-rays. I saw a lady through the window, I knew it was for me, she opened the doors and asked @ PERSON1. She followed us to a room where we waited about forty-five minutes for a doctor to come and take us to the x-ray room. When they finished, we went back to the room and waited a bit. Before the doctor came in and told me I hadn't broken anything he gave me a brace and I went home, @ CAPS2 all that, I was patient.
I was patient when my birthday arrived. I'm waiting for my birthday at my father's this @ DATE1. My birthday was @ NUM1 on @ DATE2. I get a @ CAPS1® from my dad for my birthday. I was patient when my birthday arrived. I'm expecting my birthday at my father's this @ DATE1 my birthday was @ NUM1 on @ DATE2. I get a @ CAPS1® from my dad for my birthday.
"@ CAPS1 again @ NUM1 days I'll be on my way to Cedar Point. I wonder what we'll do when we get there for the first time? What will end up being my favorite ride? Maybe I can convince my mom to go on a trip @ NUM1 days ago ? " " @ CAPS2 mom "said @ PERSON1. " @ CAPS3 "her mom said. " @ CAPS4 we @ CAPS1 are going to ???? point now ? " " @ CAPS5 darling, our tickets are for DATE1 @ thy @ CAPS1 will have to be patient. " “ Ok, I'll do my best. " " Girl " ! As @ PERSON1 went up to her room she thought if she tried to clear her mind she might forget. So to do this, she called her friend @ CAPS6 to see if she wanted to come. @ CAPS6 said @ CAPS3 ! "@ CAPS7" rang the doorbell. "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS6 do you want to go play in my room?" "Where". @ CAPS10 that night @ CAPS6 went home and @ PERSON1 went to bed. @ NUM3 days @ CAPS10. More than a day for ??? @ CAPS10 that night @ PERSON1 went to bed around @ NUM4 to sleep well ??? the trip. But at @ ORGANIZATION1 suprice, she wakes up @ CAPS1 a few hours @ CAPS10. She was so excited she couldn't sleep! She finally fell asleep and they left early the next morning.
Patience is useful at times like waiting for a blood test or your ??? again. At other times patience is unnecessary, like in the army, in any army sometimes you wait to die at the hand of your enemy. Patience is usually good because if you rush you might hurt someone, miss something useful, or just something you enjoy.
One time I was patient was when I was at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and waiting to get in the dragster, the queue was long. We waited @ NUM1 hours and we were still in line to wait. Eventually we got on there and they said the ride would be closed for a while to check on something and it took them a whole hour to fix it. So we went to the other side of the park and we were waiting for the train to come and it came it took the train @ NUM2 minutes and when we got to the other side of the park the ride I wanted to do was turned the rapids, the line was really long, so we waited and waited and finally it was our turn to go up, it was fun, and then when it was over we came back. On the train and I went back to the other side. We went back to the dragster then the queue was long and we waited and waited and then it was our turn. That day was the worst day because I had to wait and wait it was the first day I had to keep my patience as long as I was about to lose my mind but we did. And we return this @ CAPS3.
Back when I was patient it was when I went to a pair and we had to stand in line for about two hours. I was bored just standing there, but I really wanted to go for walks and that's what was waiting for me in the queue. I was trying to wait for the online hole time so I could get my @ CAPS1 ?? keep riding because i hated standing there the whole time my feet started to hurt because i was ??? ??? there I finally got to the first row to get my ticket. I was so happy and it was a time when I was patient.
A time when I was patient: I am patient when my family, or my friends, or my teachers speak. I don't interpret them while they speak, I wait to make sure they are finished speaking before I start speaking. Another thing is to be polite, I am polite in class and at home I don't speak when it's not my turn. Another thing is, I'm really nice to people, I'm not mean to anyone, I listen to what they have to say. When I'm at school you sometimes have to wait your turn. Like having a drink, or having your lunch, or going in single file for a fire drill. You can also be kind and patient if someone hasn't finished, you can help them and that would be really kind and patient. These are the things I do to be patient.
Hi I'm @ PERSON1 And this was a time when I was patient. My mom and step dad were going to take me And my step sister to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1. CORN!! There was a twist we couldn't ask "are we there yet". So we had to wait a very long time. But when we got there we got there so it was worth the wait.
Patience is sometimes difficult to achieve. But that doesn't mean that you have to give up and keep trying and your willpower will be successful, you rush through life and get impatient and you have used and been successful. I will tell you a folk virtue story to explain patience. "@ CAPS1 year in the fall, a big race takes place. All the animals from @ CAPS2 come to. It is an extraordinary event. It is a tradition that @ CAPS1 year, a slow animal and a first around move to see who the champion is. At the time, the @ CAPS5 was the fastest @ CAPS2. @ CAPS11 signed up @ CAPS1 year and won @ CAPS1 times. The @ CAPS15 s' was entered to finish this year. @ CAPS11 was very important t in and himself and should be proud of @ CAPS12 because @ CAPS11 was pretty much slow and @ CAPS11 can't be a champion. "Runners get ready !" the announcer shouted. The @ CAPS5 and @ CAPS15 lined up. "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 !! "@ CAPS5 rushed forward kicking the air. For the @ CAPS15 waiting very slowly behind. @ CAPS5 ran like @ CAPS11 never won. @ CAPS11 never looked back . @ CAPS11 wanted to win. The trophy was rightfully his. Right ? I mean, @ CAPS11 was the fastest animal. @ CAPS15 continued his way slowly but surely to the line arrival. "@ CAPS6 @ CAPS6." @ CAPS5 stopped and looked around. There was no one there. "@ CAPS9 is that noise?" @ CAPS11 asked aloud. "@ CAPS6 “it came from his stomach @ CAPS11 was so caught up in the race @ CAPS11 didn't realize how hungry @ CAPS11 was.” @ CAPS12 a small handful of berries. ”@ CAPS11 decided. @ CAPS11 chose a handful , then another and another. Finally @ CAPS11 was full and a little asleep. "I'm going @ CAPS12 to take a little nap after anything @ CAPS15 isn't going to catch up anyway." @ CAPS11 lay down and ad ormi. @ CAPS5 didn't know @ CAPS11 was eating and napping all the time, @ CAPS15 was caught up? @ CAPS11 saw @ CAPS5 sleeping and decided not to bring him @ CAPS12 in case @ CAPS11 was sick and @ CAPS11 continued slowly very slowly up the hill to the finish line. @ CAPS5 woke up to the sound or to the cheers. @ CAPS11 stood up. The @ CAPS15 won! @ CAPS11 ran to the finish line but was too late, @ CAPS15 had already won. If @ CAPS11 had been patient, @ CAPS11 might have won.
In my thirteen years of experience, I have ridden many roller coasters, and when there are roller coasters, it normally takes two hours of waiting. In the @ DATE1 @ NUM1 I took my best friend @ PERSON1 to "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2" and we had just lined up for a ride called "The @ CAPS3". When we got to the entrance @ CAPS4 indicated a forty-five minute wait so we stood in line and the ride broke down for over three hours. Finally the ride was up and running, but @ CAPS4 took another half hour for testing and when that finished @ CAPS4 was a two hour wait in the back. We were at the front so @ CAPS4 didn't really affect us. We eventually hiked this ride and was totally worth @ CAPS4. Most lines later that day were small but it's still an hour. I just hope next time this ride doesn't break down.
I remember a long time ago when I was patient for a long time. I waited for about four months. I was waiting to receive the @ CAPS1 video game system. And I have been extremely patient for it. So basically what happened was there was this amazing, high tech new gaming system coming out. L '@ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS1. Everyone was eager to get it. Including me. The only problem was that they were all sold. So for Christmas, my father told me he would give me one. I was so happy. But we both knew it would take a long time before he could get one. So I waited, waited, waited. Then one night around @ TIME1, my dad woke me up. He said they were selling a lot of @ CAPS3. So we got in the car, drove to the top level, and waited a long time in the line. Finally, it was our turn. We bought the @ CAPS1, went home and installed it. The next day, I finally played my @ CAPS1: And this is the story of a time when I was patient.
My mom went to the doctor a few weeks ago before school ???. we went there as @ NUM1 and only went to @ NUM2. So me and my little sister played a game for fun. So we watched TV, played on our ipods, and told stories that we were so bored. So once it all got boring we just had to sit and wait and sit and wait for school but I just thought how much ??? it was??? to be??? we left then lie ??? ??? ??? ??? until the dear gets up and ??? fly cut to our seats. But it turns out it was someone else. ??? than me and ??? ??? sleeping. Then all of a sudden I feel someone shake me and say "lexi tayler" my mom called over and over until we woke up so now ??? are ready to ??? and go to the mall. So we went to spend the rest of that day at the mall. And that was my story about when I was a patient sitting at a doctor ??? ??? ???.
"@ CAPS1 can I have a puppy." "@ CAPS2" "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS1" @ CAPS4 in the @ DATE1 please be patient. " " @ CAPS5. " @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 came down the stairs to sulk, she's thinking of a brilliant plan to speed up @ NUM1 days until @ DATE1," I'm going to make a long chain of paper at @ NUM1 links. " @ CAPS8 days or @ NUM1 days she ripped a link. She tore @ CAPS9 then @ CAPS10 and even @ CAPS11 years old. Before she knew it it was @ DATE1 the first. @ CAPS7 got out of bed, ripped off the last link and said: "@ CAPS1 can I have a puppy but I have been patient." "@ CAPS13 you see", @ CAPS1 told him. Your dad and I have been thinking and it's a big responsibility so @ CAPS4 next @ DATE1. "@ CAPS14, I will be patient."
This is the story of a vampire named @ CAPS1 who attends regular college. It was the first day of school and @ CAPS1 was lining up for her schedule and later combonaiton. And that line was really long. @ CAPS1 was late the first day and had to step back. The person in front of him kept complaining and @ CAPS1 became ??. It will take forever! complained the person across the way. “@ CAPS3 shut up man. I don't like it more than you but you see me complaining? ” @ CAPS1 exclaimed. Everyone in the gym stopped talking and looked in his direction. It was not a good sign. @ CAPS1 stopped talking and just stood in line. After @ NUM1 long minutes of listening to music on his ipod @ CAPS5, he was @ NUM2 people away from the front row . Then something bad happened. "@ CAPS3 it's not my schedule !" said a blonde girl. The person who distributed the schedules had to call everyone back to see who had their schedule. So @ NUM1 more minutes passed until he finally got his schedule. If @ CAPS1 hadn't been patient, he wouldn't have held the @ NUM4 minutes online ! Fortunately he brought his ipod @ CAPS5 !
Once I was patient, I was waiting @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 whole months for my little brother, @ PERSON1 who is @ NUM3 now. @ CAPS1 felt like @ NUM2,000 years @ CAPS1 was ??? long time I couldn't wait but had to be patient to wait. It was due on @ DATE2, but instead it was issued on @ DATE1. When I came to ????. Finally at @ NUM5 am on @ DATE1 my brother @ PERSON1 was finally born ??? @ NUM2 long months. The ??? a while I used ???
I remember when me, my brother, my father and my mother were at a standstill. I wanted to do so many rides but they all had great lines. So we waited for the rapter which took an hour just to get on the ride but when we got on it felt like it was even longer than the queue it was @ NUM1 hours because of how ??? it was. We walked around and saw the ??? force he had a ??? ??? on it so we queued was much longer than the rapter it was like 3- @ NUM1 hours. But when we got to the top of the stairs it was so much fun because we waited so long and my brother stopped because he was so ??? in me. the ride was fun but when we were done we had to leave ??? was like mom. We only wait on the rides but it was fun and ??? It was a time when I was patient.
My friend and others showed loyalty in a room called @ CAPS1 children's @ CAPS2. They come once a year. Everyone gets ready, learns their roles and we put on a show in a week. We have shown loyalty by believing in each other. When you're on stage in front of people, you have to support each other. When someone forgot to come in on time, you would help them by reminding them of the next time. When someone forgot their line, you would help them by saying it for them. We have been loyal throughout @ NUM1 days. The coin proves to be excellent every year by supporting each other.
I was patient when I was at @ CAPS1.R where I broke my finger almost a week ago.
I am not a very patient person ???. However there was a time in my ??? where I have been extremely patient. I was in @ NUM1th grade and doing something called ??? Ms. Bowos @ NUM2nd grade. Would we stay there ???. As you probably know, @ NUM2nd grades students aren't very good readers, but there was one girl who wasn't good at all. She needed ??? everyone's help @ PERSON1 would send the down in the ??? to help the girl ???. She struggled a lot and she would never praise she would close the book like it was on fire ???. But it was patient and each time she ??? every time she stopped reading. I would make her continue. Every time she took it out on the floor, I would ???. Finally, the girl saw that it did not accomplish anything ??? That, then, she just read. Now I had to be patient with how slowly she read. IP, she didn't know a word, I would help her pronounce it. The girl kept improving in reading until she no longer needed me. But I was proud of myself for being patient for once.
My own way of approaching the patient is when someone does something. You have to wait for them to finish. And if you rush them, they'll likely make a mistake or do something wrong. Being patient is very important. Being patient is also a very respectful thing to another person because you are not rude.
There are several times that I have been patient, but this one was not that long ago. In fact, it was yesterday when I was taking the meap. I'm just sitting there, done, just read and draw. It was absolutely boring, lame and the seconds seemed like hours. It was terrible, but I didn't complain, I just sat there and didn't do anything. And that was probably the worst time I wanted to speak but I couldn't.
The time I was licensed was when I was in school I was in math and getting ready to settle so I could go to my friends @ ORGANIZATION1 so I was waiting and what and what and what and what and what @ CAPS1 my classwork and @ CAPS2 the @ ORGANIZATION2 rang I was @ CAPS3 agen @ CAPS1 thare is a @ CAPS5 @ CAPS1 it was not a @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 against we had the meap so it was only a @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 in all classes so we only had @ CAPS11 @ NUM1 minits left until moms came out so i @ CAPS12 some want and @ NUM2 minits passed, then me and I manage. That's good @ NUM2 minits so @ NUM4 minits @ NUM5 minits @ NUM6 @ NUM7 @ NUM8 @ NUM9 @ NUM10 @ NUM11 @ NUM12 @ NUM12 on the left now @ NUM1 secents rims then it's the @ ORGANIZATION2 and what @ CAPS13 when was esent
Someone was standing in line for a hot and ready pizza because they are hot and ready, a lot of people were in line and everyone was screaming and getting angry because they thought the pizza was supposed to be hot and ready. Everyone was throwing tanruns. The children sat quietly on the small benches they had available and watched them make tanrums. The people who worked in the cedars were trying because there were a lot of people there and everyone was obscene. No one showed patience. They only cared about the pizza. Small hungry children were more patient than angry adults. They were all complaining and everyone was saying they didn't want to hear from you so you had to shut up. After he's there, he patiently waits for the tail, his mouth shut. He didn't bother to speak. Everyone was back to normal and everyone had a smile on their face and even the little kids got their pizza very quickly. Always be patient.
I asked my mother if I could have something to eat. She @ CAPS12 doesn't say @ CAPS1 so I wait wait then wait wait and wait, then I went up the stairs and waited @ CAPS2. I was hungry then I was patient the whole time @ CAPS3. I usually use @ CAPS4 for @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8, I do. Another time @ CAPS9 thanksgiving I was patient @ CAPS3 they were cooking @ CAPS4 and they @ CAPS12 weren't cooking @ CAPS4 yet so we waited for @ CAPS4 to be @ CAPS16 our stomachs were growling for @ CAPS4 so I @ CAPS13 A man patience @ CAPS3 I waited for the @ CAPS4 to be @ CAPS16.
Patience is a quality that some people have and others don't. it shows your character to people whether your patient or not. It can be difficult at times, but we all do it. For example, when I was in a restaurant that took forever to bring us our food, I had to be patient. I was sitting at the table after ordering, and I got really bored so I decided to color in with the pencils I had. After I was done with that, I decided I needed to find something else to do while I waited. My mom was talking, so I chose to do that. I spoke for a long time. Then our bread came. So, I ate that for a while, and then I got bored again. The waiter came over and told us our food would be available soon. So I continued to talk, I went to the bathroom. When I returned our food was there! So I sat down and enjoyed the delicious meal. When I was patient, I got a good reward. Good things always happen to people who are patient. If you are not a patient person, you can still try to be. It's not very difficult, just keep busy!
Once I was using the patient was when I finished my book. We have what is called teacher interviews where you tell the teacher what you have finished with your book. I have completed the @ NUM1 books titled "The Brotherhood of Holy Travelers" I have completed the last two books. I wrote my name on the board for the teachers' speech. The teacher continued to choose other people. I had to wait until I got called. Every day I went to @ NUM2 and @ NUM3 hours hoping that I would be called. But everyday, that wouldn't happen. I finished another book so I rewrote my name. But I still haven't been called. I put @ PERSON1 @ NUM4 which means I have finished @ NUM5 books. Finally @ DATE1 my name was called. I ??? to the teacher with all the @ NUM5 books. I got to tell him about my books and was very happy that I got my name.
I was patient in the dentist's office. When I went to the dentist, I had my bracts put on. When I was sitting there they told me they had to get my brackets and my wire. While they were receiving the supports and the thread, I was able to choose the colors. I waited about @ NUM1 minutes. Without complaining. Then they started to put the hooks on the glue. When they put on a stand I felt so weird and kido tasted like heated metal "@ CAPS1" I said. After they put on the brocades and then they put on colors. My mouth hurts like crazy! When it was all over I noticed it had been @ NUM2 hours ! I was surprised because I didn't know I was sitting there for @ NUM2 hours, but I was very patient and waited this whole time ! It was when I was a patient in the dentist's office.
One time when I was very patient, that was when I went to "@ CAPS1" ceider to the point .. I went to the point ceider with my aunts and cousins NUM1 @ @ NUM1. It was only the older girls who went there, because we knew that if we took the little people we couldn't get into the haunted houses, even if we went inside one of them. they. It was so much fun until we got to the lines. They were ridiculously long. I mean it literally took us about an hour and a half to ride the roller coaster. My cousins and I were talking a long time. We were at the back of the whole game called "The Dead Zone", it was very terrifying but fun at the same time. What a strange feeling. We finally got into the place and we still had a long way to go, stairs to climb, bars to go through, it was terrible. But we complained, not me. I was patient unlike my cousins. We finally got to the top floor and can you believe it we still had to wait. Then, my cousins have music to take us, but not for long. Then we looked and realized how far away we were, and started talking about how scary it would be to fall. Then we continued to talk. But soon after, people said " were going to wait a minute to check and make sure the @ CAPS2 coaster has no mechanical issues ." That's when my cousins left. We tried to calm her down. So we all sat down and waited. Finally, the line moved forward again. Then we hit the top of the roller coaster @ CAPS3. We finally got to see the roller coaster @ CAPS2, guess at that point it seemed like time was passing maybe because we were excited. We were finally on the merry-go-round, one of the funniest rides in the whole park called "La mauerie". Guess it was worth the wait. The ride was about @ NUM3 per hour, it was choppy, there were drops, it was fun. We've been a little patient, but have we had enough patients to recover, I don't think so.
One day when I was shopping for an offroad motorcycle helmet online I was told that the shipping was in three days and for me it was not very long. When day three arrived and I was waiting on my porch for my helmet to come, my mom told me my helmet was stuck at @ LOCATION1 and wouldn't be there until next week. after she told me i thought you just had to be patient because the next week i just went to work with my dad. after my week was over i was sitting on my porch waiting and almost fell asleep when a truck from @ ORGANIZATION1 came over and gave me my brand new helmet.
Once my friend was waiting for me to stay in there for an hour. I was taking my time, he would wait even if he couldn't. I got out of the bathroom.
When it was @ DATE1 @ CAPS1 and I couldn't wait @ DATE1 then I open my gifts. My mother and father give us my sister and my second sister and me. give us some money so we can go and buy what we like. My daddy mom and dad and my mom and my mom dad and mom give us money. like my mum and dad fix, and I remember I bought some cute cuformin boots and I could wait to open the boots on @ DATE1 and I was @ CAPS2 up and down and wondering if we could open a gife it's @ DATE1 @ CAPS1 and my mom and dad said no and i got mad. So the next day I wake up on @ DATE1 and it was on top of @ NUM1 in the morning and I look in the living room and no one was up so I have to wait for my patent to wake up and I could wait and time takes forever and it was a moment that I couldn't wait for.
I think patience is about waiting instead of rushing things. If you are patient things will actually come faster than you think, like if you want something and have to queue instead of running and finding something else and waiting. always help. Be patient with what you do, just be patient, even if you wait until school is even. If you are waiting for the same rod to come and sit, be patient, as it might get you out of trouble. Be patient what even your doing even if your waiting for a ride just wait, it's not a big stop a lot of rushing stuff, just be very patient.
“@ CAPS1 on @ CAPS2, where are you,” @ PERSON1 said in a frustrated tone. @ CAPS2 was supposed to go to @ CAPS1 at his home. @ PERSON1 had just got a new trampoline and they were planning on bouncing all day after school. @ PERSON1 was starting to worry but he waited. Eventually her mom came over and told her @ CAPS2 wasn't coming. That's when the phone rang. @ PERSON1 answered it and heard @ CAPS2 at the end. "@ CAPS5, @ PERSON1", croaked @ CAPS2. It didn't sound right. "@ CAPS2", @ PERSON1 yelled into the phone, "@ CAPS2, @ CAPS2 where are you." "I'm home, come over here. @ PERSON1's mother stopped by @ CAPS2 and let him out. @ PERSON1 didn't care about manners at this point, so he opened the door and walked over to @ CAPS2's bedroom. @ CAPS2 was lying in his bed staring at the circle with his very swollen face. He turned to look @ PERSON1, met his gaze, then looked at the ceiling. @ CAPS2 was also not at school that day. He went skiing in his family chalet. I was not patient when I was in the air. I was crushed and none of this would have happened if I had waited.
Once, I was patient, it was with my father. Our electricity had just gone out so we thought about waiting up to two minutes as it always happens. after a few days we ran out of electricity, i was sick. On the third day we called people and figured it out ??? before our power lines, they fixed it and we got our electricity back.
There are two reasons why I think patience is important. The first is that if you are not patient you can end up distracting other people around you. For example, if you finished your @ CAPS1 test earlier and keep telling everyone to bury, it's distracting. Now that you've cut everyone off they've lost their train of thought and now they @ MONTH1 have to start over. A few weeks ago my sister and I were walking my dog and pulled so hard my little sister fell and my dog ran away. We had to be patient and wait for his return. My sister still wanted to go and call my mom to tell her the dog had run away again, but I told her it would be rude to call as it would distract her from her job. Another reason why patience is important is that if you are not patient, you can get hurt. Let's say you were going down the stairs and your brother was in front of you and you had to come down quickly, but they were going down the stairs very slowly, so you were pushing them, they could be seriously injured. In conclusion, patience is always necessary and cannot be forgotten
"@ CAPS1, @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1" the clock was counting down "@ CAPS1, @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1" so close that I cried as the clock continued. My heart was beating like a racing car engine. I could hear my heart be boom, be godsend ??? my mind ran while i was going to do ??? jump in the pool, watch, play a video game. so many options, what should I do "@ CAPS1, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1" I could almost hear Pael calling me "swim, swim swim" what should I do. I looked at mrs. Sprowl then back to clock then mrs.sprowl then back clock and mrs.sprawl. My heart almost jumped out of my body in so much anticipation. second hand "@ CAPS1, @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1" so close i said so close just @ NUM1 second left then i can swim my pool. “@ NUM2” I almost jumped out of my seat and shouted “@ NUM3” @ CAPS2, @ CAPS2, @ CAPS2 “we have announcements,” Ms. White said. freedom.
I have been patient the whole time. I was happy on the outside, but inside I wish I had a better score
Child, my mother always. My being patient and well I couldn't do I am writing this about it. My mother is very kind, cool, rich and above all, patient. As many things as I did when I was a child, and a few more hours my mother calms down as if we hadn't done anything. it's pretty funny how patience she has . Long ago. I remember wasting grape pop on her new carpet !! Wow, how scared I got… I think I got my pants wet !! @ CAPS4 instead of hiding it like any other kid when she got home I cried at @ CAPS3 I wasted pop on your carpet, don't get mad " she responded in her soothing loving mother's voice, "@ CAPS1 urges me to clean it up. "I passed her a dry towel and I remembered this time a kid I can't reach the sink) @ CAPS4 without screaming she walked up the stairs and wet the towel herself- same. I stood down the stairs to watch the purple @ CAPS2 mess I made trying to help my mom, "just sit down," she said, holding my hand. At that time, mom got rid of the stain, I was quickly asleep on the sofa. My mom gave me a kiss on the cheek @ CAPS4, she didn't wake up !! The concert was adjourned as soon as she picked me up. "@ CAPS3 is that you ??" I say in my morning voice. My mother being a patient @ CAPS4. @ CAPS4 what's for breakfast ??. In a shrill voice. I'm going to get started, ”she said as she left my breakfast. I love my mom.
@ CAPS7 year @ CAPS4 went to @ ORGANIZATION1, it was about two weeks before school started. That day, the schools of @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 had just opened, so there was no queue. @ CAPS4 couldn't or chose a better day. Then @ CAPS4 got to the mantic, I didn't want to go, but @ CAPS5 mom said "@ CAPS1 will be bad, @ CAPS2 ? I said "@ CAPS3 fine, I'm going to continue the ride" @ CAPS4 is about to take off up the hill and just when @ CAPS4 got to the top the ride stops. ' I was panicked at first, but then I got over it. So we've been around for about @ NUM1 min or @ NUM2 and @ CAPS4 must have been patient. ' @ CAPS5 mom and dad are inside them. ' @ CAPS4 were sitting on bicycle seats @ CAPS4 were uncomfortable. So another @ NUM3 min stuck and now @ CAPS4 have stayed up for @ NUM4 mins. ' @ CAPS7 is where @ CAPS4 had to be completely silent and patient. Then the trip started and @ CAPS4 got to the bottom and finished the trip. They gave us a pass to allow us to cut the line on force @ CAPS8. That's all they gave us. So @ CAPS4 had fun the rest of the day, but that I learned in life that you have to have patience!
Once upon a time there was a princess named @ ORGANIZATION1. @ CAPS1 was invited to a royal ball where @ CAPS1 was expecting her handsome prince. When his car arrived , @ CAPS1 stalked people before going out. Finally, @ CAPS1 got out of the vehicle. @ ORGANIZATION1 walked the red carpet. As @ CAPS1 arrived, the more noise there was, the closer the princess finally approached the open doors. The beautiful girl walked to her throne and made the people of the village dance among her. @ PERSON1 sat for two hours. @ CAPS1 erred "will it appear?" and "will he love me ?" » @ CAPS1 doubted his luck. The princess grabbed the mike, “@ CAPS2! @ CAPS2! @ CAPS3 does he know where my prince is ? " " @ CAPS3 ? " complete silence fell over the crowd. Finally at the last minute. '@ CAPS4' an anonomyse voice crossed. I am the prince! A sigh of relief came over her. "@ CAPS5 I '. I'm very late ??? fought a dragon and a thousand knights. To come here to meet my love! Awwwww ! The crowd said softly. And he lived happily ever after. The @ CAPS6!
The only time I was patient was when my mom took me to get my birth certificate so I could play football. When we got there the parking lot was full, I mean the cars were so close you could barely get in and out without scratching someone's car. My mother parked through the streets the streets. When we entered there there were at least @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 people parked. People were standing so close to each other that you could tell their body temperature. The bench was full of people and they were parked like a dardine. It was hot and smelled of must. We chose a post with @ NUM3 and they were on @ NUM4. We waited two hours. My mother wanted to leave. When they got to our number, I was sleeping. While we were in there, I lost ten pounds.
I am not a very patient person. I always whine and complain. If patient means you stay somewhere for a set without complaining, then I guess there are times I have been patient, but only if there is a friend there to take care of me. My mom was in the hospital once for a long time, about @ NUM1 hours. My friend @ PERSON1 was there and we spent some time together. It was actually a lot of fun. We ate in the cafeteria. We stole milk for no reason and totally forgot my mom was there. I haven't complained once. Then we got yelled at and had to go back to the waiting room, but it still wasn't too bad. it was one of the few times i was patient, and i don't know if that matters since i was with someone.
"@ CAPS1!" I screamed as the ball went straight towards me. “It was @ CAPS1!” Said @ CAPS2. "@ CAPS3 I was already there." I answered. "@ CAPS4. @ CAPS3 is @ CAPS1." @ CAPS13 supported. "@ CAPS5 I said @ CAPS1, you ??? Moved and let me get it then wimp @ CAPS6 me. And watch the ball drop. I exclaimed. " @ CAPS7 I guess. "@ CAPS2 s 'is excused. It was during the volleyball trials where I had to be patient and work together. "@ CAPS9 is @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11 !" asked the coach of Team A. "@ CAPS12 teams up in groups of three! ”@ CAPS13 said ??? Mu two best friends som and @ PERSON1 were already with this new girl, which was pretty good. “ You wanna partner with me and do that? ”@ CAPS14 asked. "@ CAPS15," I replied. When it was our turn on @ CAPS11, we were going against @ CAPS16, @ PERSON1 who gave it to us. Katie totally missed the ball. The new girl, @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS16 all cheered. "@ CAPS18 ! Very nice job ladies!" ??? One of the coaches. It was the end of the second practice of @ DATE1. There was only one @ DATE1 left. It was difficult for me @ CAPS3 that I managed to keep it together and patient. The @ DATE1 of the trials, we got to know our teams. We all received envelopes and opened them at the same time. Me, @ CAPS16 and @ PERSON1 as well as other good girls made the A team ! So this is a time where I had to be really patient and stick together, @ CAPS3 I did and still succeed.
Once upon a time there was a boy name @ PERSON1. Hawell he was right and he was at the secretary of state and he ?? patient so he came in and took a number and got his paper from the woman. At the reception at ??? and ??? ??? and started ??? he went out and only on @ NUM1 she is counting slowly so he gets angry !! And the time ?? by and ??? is it on? and there is ?? in front of him and let go get there ??? secretary card and the person in front of him is standing, the lady behind the desk opened up and called @ PERSON1 and he greeted her with a ??? she took this pic and he got his license then finished
I was patient when my dog had to go to @ CAPS1 he was really sick because he had heartworms from my mom and just did what for about two hours. I wasn't as skated as my mom because I keep asking my mom what's going on. After the operation was over we had to do even longer until we got my dog back almost at NUM1 hours. After @ CAPS1 called us we went to get my dog and the doctor said he had to water until he could get up and move and everything was fine and we played in the snow all the way through by @ CAPS3.
AHH! Oh hi my name is @ CAPS1 I'll tell you how I waited @ NUM1 @ NUM2 @ CAPS2 to do something sweet. Ok i heard about this awesome but scary place called @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 ! Me and a few friends of mine @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 are planning to @ CAPS7 over there at @ DATE2. So far, me and them have only done the ordinary. @ CAPS5 up, @ CAPS5 in the shower, @ CAPS5 dressed, @ CAPS7 at school. Today @ DATE1, @ CAPS8 are going to my parents and @ CAPS7 online to see when it opens. @ CAPS8 found out in two days that the new location would open. It's near the living room and down the street from @ ORGANIZATION1. So @ CAPS8 drops him and he's nearby so @ CAPS8 is read so much to cry like a baby when you take his bottle away from him. Today is the day @ CAPS8 is on the road, but what @ CAPS8 has achieved is how many people will be there. When @ CAPS8 arrived there were at least @ NUM3 people waiting ! @ CAPS8 was in line and about every @ NUM4 minutes the line was decreasing by @ NUM5 people. Then finally about @ NUM6 and a half @ CAPS2 waiting @ CAPS8 were in the @ NUM7. It was just luck too, @ NUM1 people weren't patient enough to wait but @ CAPS8 were respectful. Then @ PERSON2 had to @ CAPS7 use the toilet so @ CAPS8, cross the street so he could @ CAPS7 then when @ CAPS8 came back @ CAPS8 found himself at the top @ NUM9! @ CAPS8 waited for another @ NUM10 then @ CAPS8 were in! By the time @ CAPS8 finished @ PERSON2 was crying (he's @ NUM11!) @ PERSON1 got his pants wet (he's @ NUM12!) And @ NUM13 and I didn't do anything, @ CAPS8 had a hell of a night but it was never would have happened if @ CAPS8 hadn't been so patient.
Patience is an important thing to have. If you help and respect others. If you are not patient, things will only get worse. My cousin is a big fan of @ PERSON1. She wanted tickets for her concert, but when the tickets were sold online, she didn't know anywhere else to get them. She didn't know anywhere else to get them. She saw on the news that they were giving out tickets the morning of the concert. She wanted to be on the front lines. Well, everyone too. She arrived at @ NUM1 am and there were still at least two hundred people in front of her. She had to wait several hours in line until she could see the ticket at once. Finally when she got to the front, she got her tickets. She was patient and didn't complain. Later that night, she got close enough to the fifth row seats to see the sweat on @ PERSON1's face which shows how patience can work. Maybe if my cousin had been so patient, she would have had the tickets. Patients will take you @ NUM2 a long way, especially if they're trying to gain respect. My cousin inspired me to be a patient person @ NUM2, and maybe I'll get concert tickets someday.
When I went to the game with @ LOCATION1, @ PERSON1, and his mom and dad. @ PERSON1 has downs syndrome. And he likes to watch the games. He likes to encourage them when they play. He also likes to give them five years after they've finished playing. I didn't laugh at him. I thought he was a pretty cool guy. He really likes to talk about " suffice that sports are cartoons." » I did not manage to make him win, he speaks. I don't think he walks and or makes funny noses. He considers each to be his country, which they are. When in line, he moves a lot. He screams as the @ DATE1 port has the ball and heads for a drop. When he gets angry when he gets angry, he doesn't have the ball and he scores. I @ CAPS1 him That we will get him @ CAPS2. He says yes I now that. He therefore likes to go to the feeling to watch. But they won't let the feeling be heard yet, so I @ CAPS1 to make him patient and calm down. When the game is over, his mom takes us to @ LOCATION1's house. We sat in the @ CAPS2 being round and taking. But she didn't get angry. Even now we had to get into an hour-long traffic jam. So after all that, I think it's patience.
Are you patient? Well, I'm still patient. I will tell you about a time when I was patient in school. One day, I had to register for school, there were a lot of people. I had to wait at least ten to fifteen minutes for each line. When I finally finished all my paper work, I had to take my photo ID. in line again and take more pictures. Then I went to get my other ID. I waited a very long time, about twenty minutes. My second ID card came out and it was messed up. The lady told me that when I start school, I will get the right one. It was a time when I was patient in my life.
A time when my patient was in the last @ DATE1. My friends and I were standing in line to get an autograph from the detained tigers @ NUM1 baseman @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. It was going to be exciting meeting the players ??????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????Then to the left. It was a day when I was patient.
I was patient when I went to the doctors. When I went to the doctor, my mother and I waited a long time for the patient. It was like years but it was alone for @ NUM1 hour then when the doctor called us back to the room we waited a long time and another half hour we waited. I asked my mom " why did it take forever ", my mom said " because their other people before us ". "Oh" I said ok then.
"@ CAPS1 day I was patient in a water park and got @ CAPS1 a water slide., But they were like @ NUM1 people in front of me. At the same time I'm hot so I don't know what, I the warm floor if you don't have flip flops. But, I really want to get @ CAPS1 that waterslide no matter what. So I'm patiently standing to get @ CAPS1 the waterslide. Then I thought to myself that it would be better to be angry if or i were to be fierce. But this is @ CAPS2 i will be patient about it. Hope i have fun @ CAPS1 this ride.
I was patient last year when I was when I took the ??? and it was not done. I hate to be patient and when I do it's boring. Patients seem to take forever. And then people start having headaches and then you get in trouble with your mom or dad or your teachers for talking too much. And that's why I don't like to be patient.
Patience is when you can wait a long time and not complain. I don't think I have a lot of patience. I think patience is like standing in line for hours and not caring because you are very skated, but it all requires patience games, driving, eating while waiting and even being in school , all this requires a lot of patience.
every school year, I patiently wait for the holidays of @ DATE1. It fell like a terify while waiting @ DATE1 but it's worth it.
Hi I'm @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I have green eyes, blonde hair, I have a good personality. Okay, so I'm going to tell you about a time when I was focused. Okay, that was @ NUM1 last year @ DATE1 I think. My mom and I were gone for a doctor's appointment. So we went to @ NUM2 after school started. So when we got there I was expecting like @ NUM3 hours of boredom. I didn't know what to do so I saw the fish @ CAPS3 I watched them for about @ NUM4, doing nothing then finally the women at the counter said, "@ PERSON1 so I knew it was our turn. So we went to the room that I laid down on the bed. I fell asleep by accident, but while I was sleeping they gave me a painful bite, it hurt so much. Then I woke up and it was the "when I was patient" moment.
Once when I was patient I got an @ ORGANIZATION1 the last @ CAPS1 I requested an @ ORGANIZATION1 and my @ CAPS2 said maybe. So I waited all year, I knew I would have one but I kept on waiting and you know what I got a bruise @ ORGANIZATION1 and on top of that @ NUM1 new goues with. But over time I was going crazy knowing I was going to get the @ ORGANIZATION1. But when I finally got it I was glad I was patient, the wait was worth it especially because I really waited for my @ ORGANIZATION1.
"@ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 !! “@ CAPS3 @ ORGANIZATION1 coming down the stairs. ” @ CAPS4 must get this cool new book ! It looks really, really good. Please please please! "@ CAPS4 needs to do some shopping before @ CAPS4 leaves." replied @ CAPS1 from @ ORGANIZATION1. "@ CAPS6 you are patient @ CAPS4 can get the book." persuades her @ CAPS1. @ ORGANIZATION1 who wants the book to be bad answered ok and they went shopping. First stop, they went to the gas station then to the post office, then to the car wash, then finally to the grocery store. At the grocery store @ ORGANIZATION1 helps her to do her shopping @ CAPS1. All day long @ ORGANIZATION1 has been patient and has not complained once. “Last item on the list is pasta for dinner,” @ CAPS8 @ ORGANIZATION1's @ CAPS1. "@ CAPS7, I can't find it." "I'll go get him." @ CAPS8 @ ORGANIZATION1 who was eager to have his book. @ ORGANIZATION1 searches all the aisles until she finally finds the pasta that @ CAPS1 wants. When @ ORGANIZATION1 finally finds her @ CAPS1, she is at the checkout. When the cashier has finished ringing all the items, @ ORGANIZATION1 and her @ CAPS1 go to their car and unload. When they get home, @ ORGANIZATION1 forgot the book until @ CAPS1 came to her and gave it to her. @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS8 his thanks and then realized that it is not difficult to be patient.
I was patient when my mom went to the doctors and she was going to have a baby and had to wait in the waiting room for @ NUM1 hour for ???.
Patience is something my family doesn't have. Here is the story. I'm doing the dishes, my little brother is crying because my little sister @ PERSON2 hit him. So sense @ CAPS1 is crying (my little brother). @ CAPS3 starts to cry (my little sister). So my stepfather is playing on his iphone. He will be shouting on @ CAPS1 soon. And what do you know he's doing. OK, do you think it's gonna get better? No false. I get @ CAPS3 to stop crying. But @ CAPS1 just doesn't want to so I call @ PERSON2 here and @ CAPS1 has to hit her then my stepdad starts going crazy because he's still crying now @ PERSON2 is a kid stepping on the stairs. When ??? had ??? calm. Now, just as I'm about to go crazy, @ PERSON1 (my older brother) comes in and takes @ CAPS1 down the stairs to calm him down. Thank you @ CAPS7, for @ ORGANIZATION1. Then I calm @ CAPS3 down. What a day, I guess my family has patience, not my stepdad.
We all have our times when we are very patient, and times when we lose any patience we have. Well yesterday I was very patient my sister @ PERSON2 has tons of fits and she is very bratty. I don't know what bothers him so much. She gets very mean and violent. Here is the story. We were walking home yesterday. Everything was fine. When we got home mom told us we had to clean up. Well our room was clean and I wouldn't let @ PERSON2 come upstairs to clean it . She screamed at the top of her voice and cried. @ MONTH1 I remind you, she is ten years old. She stormed up the stairs and was on the phone with her. " Friend " @ PERSON1. I told him to hang up because we had to clean up. Yet zazin she cried. So our sister, @ ORGANIZATION1 asked @ NUM1 to shut her down, hang up the phone and clean up. Then @ PERSON2 made us listen to the SMS of @ PERSON1 . I admit that @ PERSON1 was not very nice. So we told @ PERSON2 not to answer the phone. We weren't shouting, we were very calm and patient. She was still screaming, so we left her alone to scream. Then our mother came home. @ PERSON3 and I told our mom what happened. Then our mom told @ PERSON2 that she was being punished, that she was no longer allowed to talk, text, or even talk to @ PERSON1 at school. My mom also thanked @ PERSON3 and I for being so patient. So this is my story of how I have been patient. I'm not the most patient person, but I have my time, and everyone should be too. Life is so much better in the long run if you are patient!
A time my @ CAPS1 was patient today is last week and yesterday. My @ CAPS1 was so patient with daycas that I was late for school and he was a lay man qetider about toture but he was stopping so @ CAPS1 was willing to watch and not go past him or to blow the lowest horn on him the next time my @ CAPS1 was patient is when I was in a basketball game my @ CAPS1 was waiting for me on the south side and we wanted more time, so she just said I'm getting out of the building. The last time my @ CAPS1 was patient was when we were on the subway I ordered a cup and it took me about a mint to say I had my food. I was so hungry that I couldn't drop my tomey. So at a time when my @ CAPS1 was patient.
As we walked in the smell of the deposited mouthwash, the nose moved towards the reception, a short little lady with famous hair and glasses made us fall in love. "@ CAPS1 sit down and write ranill and your dentist will be with you shortly." @ CAPS2 the lady at the kle: li. We walked to the waiting room, my mom and my brother were sitting in the waiting bus and I, but in the little tan chali in the corner. My brother received papers and pencils while my mother and a ???. But I was wrong, fifteen minutes passed by my mother's side and my brother was still doing the same thing while I looked around in the room ??? I keep asking my mom when the dentist will come, but @ CAPS4 just told me to be patient. About twenty minutes later I was @ CAPS3 to lose, I couldn't ??? I don't know how my brother could sit there and color for twenty minutes. I wanted to ask my mom when the dentist is coming, but @ CAPS4 would just tell me to be patient. I got up and started to pace. After five minutes my mom told me to sit down and find something to do. But there was nothing I could do that would finally entertain me when I was about to go crazy with a little lady in the obor way. "@ CAPS3 for your date." @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 I got up and followed him into a small room, glad the wait was over
Being patient is quietly waiting for something to happen. Often times, you have to wait for a lot of things, like long lectures, birthdays, and orchestral concerts. Sometimes, no matter how patient you are, the thing you were waiting for doesn't happen and you have to leave without doing what you wanted to do the whole time (and it has happened to me many times). For long lectures, you sometimes want to leave. You have to be patient and wait until the end of the course. For birthdays, you really want to eat the cake. But, yes, you have to wait until your annoying sister is done blowing out the candles and making her wish. I'm in the orchestra, and we have an @ ORGANIZATION1 orchestra every two months or so. The first @ ORGANIZATION1 is an open @ ORGANIZATION1 and they are usually in @ NUM1. Last year it was @ NUM2. At the end of @ ORGANIZATION1, there is a cheese cake tasting station, and cookies, and domus, and all those good cakes. But first i have to suffer while playing through many songs, watch newbies play and watch honid video ??? videotapes my face, waiting for a mistake so that any annoying can laugh about it and call me an " epicfail ". But I still live. Playing the song isn't that bad, it's just a few pieces of paper with notes on and watching newbies can be torture, but at least I don't have to play. Video @ CAPS1 ? No pain at all. Who Said I'm Going To Spoil It All? All I have to do is sit in the last row and my mom might not even see me. My sisters maybe don't even care. And then soon comes the cheesecake, like @ NUM3 at night. It's the good part, but to get to the good part, I have to be patient. I'm not really looking forward to this year's @ ORGANIZATION1, @ DATE1, because that day I have one last cross country meet after school. Where the five colleges come together for a great neighborhood come together at a place called @ CAPS2 @ ORGANIZATION2. After this meeting, my parents have to take me to this @ ORGANIZATION1 in high school at @ TIME1. The @ ORGANIZATION1 closes at @ NUM4, as always, and I hope I don't have homework. But if I do, I'll just have to be patient. This day is like any other day. @ NUM5. I'll have to wait until the end of school, the end of the meeting and the end of @ ORGANIZATION1 to get home, but I can live. All I have in mind is to live the whole school year, patiently, without spoiling or seriously failing.
Even if you @ MONTH1 don't know @ CAPS1, there is patience all around us, you @ MONTH1 don't even know you are using patience as a line for a winch or to write something, but you do. are. Here is a story. When I used patience. One day on a hot day from @ DATE1 to a wider point we decided we were going to go to the water park. As soon as we got there we skipped the first pool. I waited for my father. After some play time we decided to go to one of the water wells @ CAPS1 was the park water well. @ CAPS1 was so big you had to take @ NUM1 flights to get to @ CAPS1 but after I got back I knew @ CAPS1 was worth the wait
My story is about a time when I was a patient was in (@ DATE1). I was waiting for "@ CAPS1" to come. I was patient because we were going to @ LOCATION2. I couldn't wait to go but remembered to be "patient". The less I thought about it, the faster the time went. Then it happened, it was time to head to "@ LOCATION2" when I was in the car on my way to go, I couldn't wait! More and more roads passed. We went from town to town; state to state. It was already the next day and I still couldn't wait. During the long drive I fell asleep when I woke up, we were already there. I had to be patient because driving from @ LOCATION1 to @ LOCATION2 is a long journey. While being patient, I got to see a lot and travel through different states.
Patience is something that most people don't have. In the story, patience was something I needed. If I hadn't had patience in the story, I don't know what I would do. This is my story. A few years ago I was picked up from school. My mom was supposed to take me home, but she wanted to go shopping first. When we were there she asked me if I wanted to come in. Thinking of all the reasons I don't, of course, I said no. I sat in the car when it was at least @ NUM1 @ CAPS1 outside. I was sweaty within ten minutes of waiting in the vehicle. My mother still hadn't left the store. There have been so many times I wanted to be angry, but I didn't let it go. I even saw people walk in and out before my mom left the store. It was at least two hours before my mom finally got out, I wasn't mad at her, I just understood her reasons and apologies for being late. Most of the time, I am not a patient person. In fact, I am never patient for situations like this. I was so glad I was patient for this story.
Sometimes on the days when I have the patience of @ CAPS1 to @ CAPS2, I have to control myself not to pick on someone or say something totally mean to them ! Like @ DATE1 in fact, we will be camping at @ LOCATION2. We always go for a hike of about one to two hours. And when we do we go to the lake @ LOCATION1 but right before that to get there we do an “adventure hike” so my dad calls it! It takes you through the woods and above or even across the river. But there are two ways you could take; a five minute hike straight to the lake @ LOCATION1, or a one to two hour hike through the woods and over logs. And on the days when I have the patience of @ CAPS1 to @ CAPS2, and just want to go straight to the lake @ LOCATION1, we still have to go around! And everyone hates the time we get to the lake, because I'm just gonna whine and whine some more! (@ CAPS3 sometimes I get mad at myself !) @ CAPS4 on the way home, more fun after swimming in the cold water of @ CAPS5 ! (@ CAPS3 my dad says it clears my head ! But it really isn't !) And by the time we get back we're ready for dinner, but dinner isn't ready yet. @ CAPS4 I'm in a bad mood… again ! And we still have to wait!
Two years ago my two year old cousin @ PERSON1 was adopted from @ LOCATION3. My aunt, uncle and cousin had to wait three years before they could even see a picture of her and start filling out some paperwork. The people in the orphanage weren't very fair to them. They almost left @ NUM1 people who had tried adopting a child a year later after my aunt and uncle tried to start. They had to go to @ LOCATION3 where they lived, which was @ LOCATION1, and wait three days until they could just see her. The orphanage made them wait another week to adopt him. Eventually, they adopted her and named her @ PERSON1. They did more paperwork, said they would still take care of her, and then went home. After that, @ PERSON1 didn't sleep at all for the first week or so. Since @ LOCATION3 is @ NUM2 hours ahead of @ LOCATION2. She slept during the day and woke up at night, they finally taught her to sleep at night. This girl took a lot of patience but was finally adopted.
The one time I was patient was the last @ DATE1 when we went to Cedars Point. When we went to Cedar Point there was a long line when we got to the front of the line the machine broke. @ CAPS1 we had to go to another trip and I couldn't wait long @ CAPS1 because I had to go to the bathroom @ CAPS1 I got out of line and went to the bathroom. When I came back there were more people in line @ CAPS1 I just waited.
My dad @ PERSON1 is patient every day. He goes to work and doesn't want to come home, but he doesn't go crazy like me because I want to leave. No he is doing his job and waiting until @ NUM1 when he can leave and go home. He still waits patiently until @ NUM1. My father has always been a patient person and I admire him for his patience.
I was at the big wolf lodge and we couldn't get in because kids poop in the pool and a big part of the pool was brown, we couldn't get in for three hours and it was very boring then we got out and there was a pool there the time of the hole.
Once when I was patient, I have been patient many times, but I especially remember when I was waiting for a friend to come home from school (I missed school) while waiting, I have does a lot of things. I played my xbox @ NUM1 and entered the computer. But while xbox i saw a friend of mine logging on. He lives @ CAPS1. Moures @ CAPS2. After he was online we played most of the day and then I went downstairs and looked @ CAPS3 because I was bored. Nothing was on so I went to the computer, still bored. So I tried to take a nap, it didn't work. After that I tried playing my Xbox, but after another hour (around @ TIME1) I got bored. I still played for about half an hour until I reset my account while listening to music and played a little more until he logged in. We played all day till night
My friend @ PERSON1 was patient last week in the lunch queue, he waited about @ NUM1 minutes. I got to the cafeteria before many other students lined up. He was behind the @ NUM2 and @ NUM3 graders. @ PERSON1 was patient in not cutting in front of them and did not comply. The queue was longer because there was a presentation and then it was lunch, the students of @ NUM2 and @ NUM3 haven't had lunch yet, that's why @ PERSON1 had to wait. I thought he had made a good wait @ CAPS2. When many students were filling the tables, I reserved a seat for @ PERSON1 next to me. @ PERSON1 finally had lunch and I saw him go to @ CAPS1 and the milk cooler and have an orange @ CAPS1. I waved to him across the room and he saw me. When he came to sit next to me I told him he did a voucher @ CAPS2, be patient and wait until his lunch. I was almost done with my cheese macovonis when @ PERSON1 said, "@ CAPS3 for protecting me a seat." When we were both done, we took care of our trays and walked down the hall to the gym. We were glad we didn't have to be in this loud and crowded cafeteria. In the gymnasium, other children were playing a little basketball game. @ PERSON1 catches a basketball. I waited until the grated @ NUM2 was done, I was patient, then the teacher told the younger ones to go back to class, when I got the ball I asked @ PERSON1 if he wanted to play in the whole world. It was @ PERSON1 and I played my favorite game.
Boom! Boom! I knew that my cousins were at the door because they all had a heavy hand. So I ran down the stairs and opened the door, it was them. Then we all got in the van you all read for fun my mom we said @ CAPS1 !!! "it was so boring in the van but I had to be patient. After we got in Ohio we pulled over and got some food. After @ NUM1 minutes we got in the van. When we got to ??? I thought we were all excited but I also knew that it would take time and patience. Then when we entered the park we weren't all straight to the crawler . half an hour to the right. It was going to take a lot of patients, so we waited and waited when we got on and off we realized it was worth it They did a lot of rides but the best was the diagster When we got to the van we all said it was fun. Then I realized that I was very patient
One day my friend @ CAPS1 and I were going to @ CAPS2 in Alabama. It was the most boring thing @ CAPS3 ! Just imagine driving a car for @ NUM1 hours while driving and stopping to use the bathroom. And to make matters worse, I had the smallest bladder out there, as I can imagine @ CAPS4 ! But we were able to count the waffle haoes because the further south you go, the more people like waffles. I'm not kidding there was at least one waffle ???. And a kind of ??? if we were n't just going to Alabama, we were going to @ CAPS5 in Alabama. So when we are finally ??? ??? still had to wait @ NUM2 more hours. But when we finally got there, we had a blast! And I have to admit that a good thing came from the experience ??? the rides don't bother us ??? ???.
I'll tell you about a time when I was patient. My cousin was at my house and needed help with his math homework. Since no one else was at home, I had to help her. We sat on the couch and I helped him. The reason I had to be patient was because he didn't know how to do all of this. So I had to sit there and teach him how to do it, and then explain to him how I got the answer. And did I mention he had three pages to go. It took almost two hours before we were done with it all. And that was a time when I had to be patient.
The father of @ CAPS2 recently lost his job. It was difficult. He has exactly @ NUM1 since @ CAPS2's dad started working. @ CAPS2 father constantly applied for jobs. But he didn't give up. He kept trying and trying. Luckily @ CAPS2's dad has a job interview at san @ CAPS1 in a few weeks. Hopefully he gets the job. Fortunately, @ CAPS2's dad was very patient. Even though he is constantly rejected, he still tries very hard to find a job. @ CAPS2's father is the model of @ CAPS2 I because of his incredible level of patience. Thank goodness I have someone to take care of me who is as patient as @ CAPS2's dad. Without the patience of the father @ CAPS2 the @ CAPS2 family could live. Well work or no work i will always love dad @ CAPS2. This would be true due to the great patience level of fathers @ CAPS2. For this main reason, which is why @ CAPS2's dad will always be @ CAPS2's hero and beloved number one role model.
Patience is a very difficult thing @ CAPS1 some people. I was at a big party once. But none of my friends or cousins was there. I was on board the whole time. I asked my mom if we could go home, she said "no". Then I sat down, waited and waited @ CAPS1 for a really long time. Then finally we came home. The next day my mother sent me to sleep at my cousins @ CAPS1. It was because I was patient at the party. I've learned that being patient isn't always a bad thing. You get good when you are patient.
Melay was a little girl, waiting for her parents in the bush of @ CAPS1. @ CAPS5 didn't know why @ CAPS5 had to do this. Her parents are in distress all the time now. @ CAPS2 must be something I've done, @ CAPS5 thought. Her sister was not as patient as @ CAPS5 expected. @ CAPS5 had to be doing something all the time. So when her parents didn't come and someone else did, @ CAPS5 was not happy. Some boys came walking along the road @ CAPS6 @ CAPS14 were hiding with @ NUM1. Melay thought, “These are boys waiting in the street. Is @ CAPS14 crazy ! " @ CAPS3 their parents told them to hide @ CAPS2 was always for a good reason. @ CAPS5 sat @ CAPS13 thinking about this when @ CAPS5 heard a big crackle ! " @ CAPS4, that was it ," thought @ CAPS5. @ CAPS5 turned to @ CAPS6, her sister was supposed to be and @ CAPS5 was not @ CAPS13. @ CAPS6 was @ CAPS5 ? " @ @ CAPS7 CAPS5 looked @ CAPS6 boys soldiers stood laughing. Was @ CAPS4 laughing at @ CAPS14 ? » @ CAPS5 took a closer look and saw that @ CAPS2 was his sister. "@ CAPS10 !" @ CAPS5 yelled. "@ CAPS6 are my parents, @ CAPS14 should be here now," @ CAPS5 thought. The boy soldiers were walking towards her. It was then that @ CAPS5 saw two more married and exhausted bodies. @ CAPS5 found out that @ CAPS2 were his parents. @ CAPS5 has started to work. Flee from tragedy. @ CAPS5 did @ CAPS2 a mile before @ CAPS5 had to go into hiding. @ CAPS5 hid in a bush. The boy soldiers walked around looking for him. Suddenly one of them shouted, “ @ CAPS13 @ CAPS5 is ! " @ CAPS14 dragged out of the bush and walked to @ CAPS4 seemed like forever. Finally @ CAPS14 has reached a version. Melay was yelling at himself, ”@ CAPS3 only I waited. @ CAPS3 only I waited. @ CAPS14 took her to a room and the boss raped her @ CAPS14 quickly shot her and dragged her to a dumpster. @ CAPS3 alone @ CAPS5 had waited.
I remember that hot day @ DATE1 WAS on my way to the @ CAPS1 / octhndontist. And I left school BECAUSE it was the second lost day, and I left school about forty-five minutes @ CAPS2. My date was @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4-thirty. So / @ CAPS5 @ CAPS3 the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 lifteen @ CAPS4 was about @ CAPS4 people @ CAPS3 and me. So / @ CAPS11 and @ CAPS4-thirly passed, so I went across the street and ordered @ PERSON1 @ CAPS14. After @ CAPS12 @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14. I bought the same gum, it was now @ CAPS15 on point. I'm still waiting, I'm going @ CAPS16 @ CAPS17, the front desk manager, how long will it take before I come in. She said she would check it out for me. She came back and said I could go on.
One time I had to be patient was when I needed help with my homework. My dad is very smart, so whenever I need help I usually ask him for help. Well i'm out of school at @ TIME1 my dad comes to @ TIME2 so if i wanted his help i would have to wait myself but i didn't get it. Even with homework that needed help in my backpack until my dad came home, I wanted homework that didn't need help. After my homework what I did all my @ CAPS1 so it was time to eat because I ate my dinner. By then, I had finished waiting for my father, more and more to help us like my dinner. He was the last to wait for my father to help him understand better.
Once upon a time there was a lonely puppy. One day he sent a letter to a random address and waited and waited and waited. A few weeks later, he received a response to his letter, it was from another puppy! They quickly became best friends and the pup learned that patients paid (ussaly). The @ CAPS1
On @ DATE1, my friend @ CAPS1 and I got on the bus towards @ PERSON1 at @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. @ CAPS1 and I were with our church group, and we were together until @ NUM1 am. We had been doing all kinds of rides all day and lined up for @ CAPS4. The sign on the front said " expect this @ CAPS3 is @ NUM2 hours ", but we were going to wait for it. I was then around @ NUM3, which would get us going around @ NUM4. We quickly found out that @ PERSON1 had also started a @ NUM5 pm and we were lucky to find ourselves right next to a haunted house. Around @ NUM6 pm we were all pretty bored so we played different hand games like slide and lemonade. Every five minutes or so we would hear loud obscene screams and still hear mouths running like they were in a race. Then around @ NUM4 pm we got behind the wheel and we all loved it. When we got down someone said "@ CAPS5, go to @ CAPS6", all the adults loved the idea. As we walked I could smell sugary treats and taste an elephant ear on my tongue. We didn't know we had to cross @ CAPS7. Caenevil was well filled with evil clowns and other creepy creatures. It was not a good idea considering that half of us were afraid of clowns. When we got to @ LOCATION1 there was a giant line, but it was only going to take forty-five minutes. The ride was over and the boy gave me a headache banging my head on my headrest so many times. On the way to the exit we saw a ton of other spooky directions. We later found out that we had been in line for five hours. We finally got on the bus and returned home. That day, I learned that I had a lot more patience than I thought.
A time I was patient was when we went on vacation. It seemed like I had waited forever to go to @ LOCATION1, in reality it had only been about a month. I was so excited, but I had to be really patient. Sometimes it's hard for me to be patient because I like things to be done right away, so waiting a month to go to @ LOCATION1 was really hard for me. The night before we left was probably the most difficult. I was so excited that I couldn't sleep at all. The day we left I was so excited and I was running around the house screaming. Finally, we loaded the car and set off for @ LOCATION1. We drove our car there so it took almost @ NUM1 days. But it was worth it, @ LOCATION1 was really fun and pretty. We also went to @ ORGANIZATION1 and had an amazing time. Had to be patient at @ ORGANIZATION1 as there were long lines for the rides so we had to wait a bit. I had a great time at @ LOCATION1 !
Everyone uses patience sometimes in their life. I have to use it every day. I need it for basketball. There could be a lot of different reasons someone should be patient. Well I have @ NUM1 in particular. My first is when people aren't paying attention. It frustrates me. When team members are having fun, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. gets upset. She 'll either tell us to hit that wide or she 'll make us run a couple laps around the gym. My first reason leads to my second . The second thing that irritates me is when people do not pay attention, they are lost and have no club on what is happening . There are a lot of people who put the time to understand . My second leads to my third. My third is when someone new joins the team. We just had to new people to join the other day and the season is half over. The new team member cannot shoot. She does not put all her efforts into it. It is just like @ NUM2 on to @ NUM3 or @ num4 person who is in good.looking done on my paper, everything that I have to be patient about. If I wasn't, I would be in trouble and that would mean I would be having poor sportsmanship. I deal with it and put up with all of this good. Over the years, I have learned to be patient. I learned to be patient too. I am happy to know how to be now or well where serais- I ? Probably not in any team or club.
I remember a time when I was a patient, it was quite difficult to wait for the doctor to call my name. But I suffered from it. Instead of getting mad at how the lady hasn't called my name yet, after waiting like @ NUM1 minutes. I just turned on my @ NUM2 reader and listened to my music while reading a magazine. Before I knew it, @ CAPS2 called out my name, "@ CAPS1" said @ CAPS2 with a smile on his face. So I got up and went to the room that @ CAPS2 pointed out to me. When I left the doctor's office and was about to continue, I thought to myself " maybe being patient isn't so bad after all !" "
Almost every time you need to be patient when you are at the doctor or in the hospital. What I do to pass the time when I'm at the doctors is playing espionage. I play it with my mom every time. There are usually a lot of people at the doctors when I go. There are magazines but I think they are boring. So I play I spy to stay patient. Otherwise I would be very bored.
@ NUM1. Last year I had to go to the doctor on my birthday. So after I got home from school, I immediately left. When we arrived we had to wait in the lobby. There were babies crying everywhere, we still had to go to the movies and go shopping. @ NUM2. There were still a lot of people in front of me. I started to get angry. Finally, they called my name. I was so happy that I didn't know what to do.
Once someone was patient was when a guy named @ PERSON2 was driving and a little girl named @ PERSON1 was walking on the sidewalk and it was a red light. She screamed out loud "go old man" continued the old man and she ran him into the store and she asked what was that and @ PERSON2 sales which was nothing. No one you tried to hit me you were running up to me, so I went. @ PERSON1 told @ PERSON2 that I was losing patience. @ PERSON2 tells him to learn how to control the entrance well.
"@ CAPS1 !" @ CAPS2 moaned, his voice turning into a moan. “You can't do this to me. I'm ten years old! " " @ CAPS2, calm down. I know you are ten years old, plus a very responsive ten year old boy. @ CAPS4 @ CAPS7 I told you before, I can't leave you at home all @ DATE1. Your dad and I have a job darling! “ @ CAPS4, can't you just hire a babysitter ? And @ PERSON3? @ CAPS13 babysat last year ! " The mother @ CAPS2 sighed. “ I know you liked @ PERSON3, @ CAPS4 @ CAPS13 just didn't fit the requirements I was looking for. Besides, you @ CAPS21 wanted to be a babysitter! Why not try to help @ CAPS16 ? " @ CAPS2 used her dazzling gaze on her mother as @ CAPS21" @ CAPS7 yes! ". This conversation had taken place two weeks ago in the fuller's kitchen. @ CAPS12, @ CAPS2's mother, @ PERSON1, took her to the only day care center in the county of @ CAPS9, @ CAPS10 and @ CAPS15 @ CAPS16. The name made @ CAPS2 want to gag. "@ CAPS12 remember honey, be nice and try to help a little. I love you!" @ CAPS13 called @ CAPS7 @ CAPS13 started to come out of the aisle. @ CAPS2 turned to face the small building. The sign above the building read “ @ CAPS10 and @ CAPS15 @ CAPS16. A friendly and loving environment ”@ CAPS13 had that gagging feeling again. @ CAPS13 turned to see if @ CAPS13 could spot the red, battered, @ LOCATION1 of his mother speeding up the poorly paved road. @ CAPS4 everything @ CAPS13 saw was a trail of dust. Awesome, @ CAPS13 thought @ CAPS7 @ CAPS13 walked in through the double doors which had a picture of a big smiling clown, "@ CAPS12, why don't you play with little @ PERSON4 ?" @ PERSON2 @ CAPS21, comforting the "little" @ PERSON4 in her arms, in fact @ PERSON4 was seven, which @ CAPS2 thought was old enough not to cry when someone yells at them when they asked to play "one" for the billionth time. "@ CAPS2 we need to talk." @ CAPS21 the middle aged woman, running away @ PERSON4 to the side, "honey, you must understand that children need patience and love. Damn, I remember you @ CAPS7 a kid ! Boy, were you an attention pig ! " @ @ CAPS2 like CAPS13 regretted having shouted. @ CAPS13 smiled and went to find @ PERSON4. Maybe he would always be ready for you.
I was patient to get my phone. I had to act in a very special way so that my mom could decide when I got my phone. It was a @ DATE4 @ TIME1 and I had to go to school but I was very patient for my mom to think it's time for me to get my new phone. When I got home I was acting like a nice little angel. But she still hasn't said it's time to have a phone the next time @ TIME1 @ DATE3 I acted the same but better. I still didn't understand, I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs. The next day @ DATE1 I cooked breakfast for my mom and was convinced it was the day to get my phone. No she just hugged me and thanked me with a smirk on her face she was waiting for me to cry out but I knew what she was trying to do so I said your welcome , although I felt intense. The next @ TIME1 I felt a little better and was ready to improve my patience so I dressed very professionally and casually, made my own breakfast and was ready to impress. I ate and walked to school. My mom was up when I got home and she said "@ CAPS1 I have to take you get something" I smiled so hard I felt like my mouth was going to drop I let go drop my backpack and we stopped at my friends house and wondered if my mom said "wait @ CAPS2" i was still wondering watching her walk into the house. She came out and gave me my brown shire which I left with my friends. I was so impatient and now my smile has turned into a fake smile. We got home and I ran straight to my room. I was doing my homework. @ DATE5 the last day of the week. I don't do anything other than mop all day. I was still patient. Then @ DATE2 and @ DATE6 I stayed with my friends. @ DATE4 my mom was up when I got up for school and she said "@ CAPS2 you can have your phone now and I hugged her tight and I ran outside impatiently for the to try.
Once I was patient, I was patient on @ CAPS1. I was able to open the presents at half past nine in the morning, I had to wait and wait. So for two hours I watched Telavison. I thought @ CAPS2 would be difficult at @ CAPS4, I passed @ CAPS2. This @ CAPS1 I thought was the funniest @ CAPS4 I lied to, I think it will be this year. That day, I had breakfast in bed. I actually had a lot of fun. I gave my mom some purfoom stuff. @ CAPS4, of course she doesn't use them. I bought him some candles, we got my dad a bright orange sweatshirt. We also offered him @ PERSON1.
Once my family and I were at point @ CAPS1 during @ DATE1. My sister really wanted to do all the little kid walks with me but I didn't want to. I wanted to do one of the fastest, highest rides out there. The @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. It looked really cool, so my dad and I ran to the entrance, but when we got them the wait time at the board was an hour and forty-five minutes. I really wanted to do this round but it really wasn't worth staying in that line. So when the line started moving and we were halfway there the signs said @ NUM1 minutes. I told my dad that maybe we should do this on another day. But my dad said we would be out soon and he told me to just watch the world go by and not talk. We only moved forward slightly and the time was @ NUM1 minutes so my dad said maybe we should do it on another day then we walked out of line to meet up with my mom and sister.
I was patient once when my dad told me he was going to give me a letter every @ DATE1 because he was too far away for me to visit him, he lives all at @ LOCATION1. He told me I had to be patient because I'm not really the type of patient. I guess being patient isn't that hard. In order for me to be patient I have to do something so I rest by writing stars and drawing, reading, going to any mother house to help with our animals. And when it finally arrived, I didn't even get it. Milk @ DATE2 so I had to wait even longer, I guess it was to do, just think about what to be patient about this.
I was patient once, really patient, but it's kind of like that. It was @ CAPS1 and my mom and I went shopping for some presents. So my mom and I went to the mall and walked into the target, and I already knew what I was going to get my brother, the new game @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ NUM1 was perfect. But my mom wouldn't let me buy it so I just bought her a target gift card for @ MONEY1 I had to hide it for almost a month, but I really wanted to know what my mom had for me and my brother, but she would. Don't tell me so I had to be patient. And when @ CAPS1 came, I was so surprised because my mom bought @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ NUM1 for me and my brother.
Once my friend @ PERSON1 was very patient, he waited @ NUM1 months for the xbox @ NUM2 @ CAPS1 vs @ CAPS2 game. He quietly waited for the game day after day. But one day after school it happened.
The patient player. Once when I was four and my sister two I was playing basketball and my sister always wanted what I had and we were always arguing over something so my sister came over and caught me the ball and when we were fighting my mom told me to stand and let her have the ball, she would go away. So I stood there patiently and waited. My sister got so bored she dropped the ball and walked away she did exactly what my mom said then when I was playing basketball again she ran and took the ball so I just went inside and played some video games.
When I had to go do my checkup with my asma or and in a familiar way like when I waited in the waiting room which had tons of stuff to do if the doctor didn't call you yet. So I was busy doing crossword puzzles and looking at the fish which were awesome because they had different kinds of fish. And then most of the time I had read my book because I am a reader and a writer at the same time but I had mostly read my book when the doctor finally came to call my name but I was still busy doing things. activities so he said he was sorry for the wait which took a while and I just said it went well and he saw everything I had done while I was waiting. And he said I was a very patient nice girl and after that I always wanted to be more patient while waiting for others in order to get good compliments which makes me feel really good with a smile on my face. lips. And since I see exactly this doctor I had an appointment with, he always gives me a treat or babysitters. But to me it doesn't matter as long as I treat others well, generally well. Because people would like to be like you someday to have patience.
When my mom @ PERSON1 and I went to @ ORGANIZATION1 it was really fun. @ CAPS1 because I wanted a lot of things my family couldn't afford, my mom was very patient. I guess she's just naturally patient. I just don't know how she does it. Anyway, all over the store it's pretty big. It is two floors! My mom was a little angry with me because I kept getting mad at her. @ CAPS1 even though she was really mad at me she tried her best not to show how mad she was in the store @ CAPS1 by the time we got home I was so tired , I could have slept for two to three days! We had everything we needed that night when we went to @ ORGANIZATION1. The next day we had to set up our nightstands. @ CAPS1 I really wanted my dad to set up our new bunk bed. @ CAPS1 my mom said he might not make it that day. I was almost literally asking my dad to put our bed up. @ CAPS1 when the time came i was fed @ CAPS1 my mom was mad at me because i wanted to sleep in my bed that night.
Once I was patient it was when @ DATE1 we went to @ LOCATION1. It was a long drive. It was long because he had a nagshion that went up to six flags and up to our hotel. I try not to complain and be patient as the ride took a day so that means sitting almost a day! We were lost in @ LOCATION1 for almost an hour walking up and down looking for our cusion which was also arriving. I had to search but there was no space for it. I wanted to go out and run, jump, but I had to be patient. It was @ NUM1 in the morning and I was tired. We still had to look for our hotel which was taking forever! At the hotel, I was unpacking my things and noticed that I was patient for almost a day, which I thought I could never do in a car. It was the time when I was patient.
Not long ago I went to the pumpkin patch with my mom, sister, grandma, aunt, uncle, @ NUM1 year old niece and baby cusin. When we were done, we went to the restaurant to eat. After @ NUM2 minutes of waiting for the waitress, she comes just to tell us that she will be with us "@ CAPS1". So we wait just half an hour to place our drink orders. When we were finally able to order our food, it took them an hour to deliver it.
Was I patiently waiting for my little sister to arrive that morning at @ DATE1 I was so excited. I'm not a very patient person so when it came to that it was so hard to sit still. Waiting for my turn to hold her was hard, but when she was in my arms it was the most amazing feeling of my life. it's always hard to have to leave her when she calls your name it's like i want to cry. I don't always come home with a little girl calling my name, but I love every minute I do. I'm still patiently waiting to see her again but it's hard if you know what I mean.
At the office of @ CAPS1. I had a meeting @ CAPS2. At the office of @ CAPS2 I was waiting in the room for her to come back. Then the @ CAPS1 asked me questions and my adoptive mother asked a question. Then she left it out, she went to the other @ CAPS1 and talked to him. Then they came back and said @ CAPS4 to you. here are the papers you need. The adoptive mother said ok @ CAPS4 you. Then the @ CAPS1 said to me : "@ CAPS4, you are patient @ PERSON1. I am learning so much", "@ CAPS5 to I will see you next time, okay." @ CAPS5, we said "goodbye".
Patient people are those who put up with life. If you are not patient, you will not do well. I learned this when I was little. There was this thing I wanted and I was going to conduct myself, but just before I got out the phone rang. My @ CAPS2 picked up : "@ CAPS1 oh hi @ PERSON1 not busy @ CAPS6 did not ! No!" and it went on for so long and every minute I got less and less patient, I finally broke. "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 '@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 !" @ CAPS6 said: "Wait @ PERSON1 I'm on the phone, I won't take you now!" and walked away. That '@ CAPS4 why the patient is important
At @ DATE1 my mom had a trip planned for us to go to @ LOCATION1 for two weeks. We were on our way to the airport and there was ?? trying to work through the traffic but couldn't. So my mom started screaming and I told her to calm down, we'll make it happen. So finally we got to the airport and there were a lot of people so we had to hurry finally we got to the airport and I taught my mother to be patient and you will understand where you are going. So finally, we got to @ LOCATION1.
When I was a patient, when I was in a dentist's office, I had six teeth pulled out. When we were waiting, I kept asking my mom "when are we going when are we going". When the said "@ CAPS1" I woke up in the room. I asked if I was going to be in pain and they told me you wouldn't fall for anything. "The doctor put a tube over my mouth and told me to close my eyes and breathe, not even knowing that I fell asleep because of the gas. I slept for two hours and when I wanted to get up from the chair they said "no, no, no" so I just sat and sat until @ NUM1 minutes later they let me out. I was on a loop and had to be put in a wheelchair. When I got to reception they let me take two toys and my mom gave me a wrestler. When we were about to leave my mom spoke to the doctor and they took forever. When we got in the car my mom took the wheelchair on the ride my mom told me that I couldn't go to school that day because of my teeth. She said not to look at me in the mirror but I did and it was weed. I had to wait three hours for fed ture and drinks so I was thirsty. When she said I could eat, I was happy. I'm still patient because the doctor said the adult teeth will come in a few months but it's been two years and nothing so I'm disappointed but now I have to be patient and wait for my mom to take me to have bcacies which will hurt a lot.
One fine day @ DATE1, I was walking towards the office @ CAPS1. I was not happy. I didn't want the son to get there. But he did. When we entered my mom walked over to the check-in lane where I just sat. When my mom was done she sat down right next to me and we waited. And we waited and waited. We waited about @ NUM1 minutes until @ CAPS1 came and called us. Just as we walked into her office a nurse walked in and checked my temperature, heat beats, eg. When she was done and left, we waited and waited. We sat there for @ NUM2 minutes before the @ CAPS1 entered. When it was done we checked and left and @ CAPS2 doesn't need to go back there anymore.
When I was and the @ NUM1 note and I had to put a mible setup, then I went to put the mible setup and it broke, then we went to the park and I had to wait for the shag, and after that I went to the ice cream maker and had to queue in a line of people and then when we got there we told them munem and axyer that we went to the ice cream. and then that's all that we have done that day when he returned home to build are mible mirne and art in this way went to the house plade outside inside the House
My friend and I were waiting to take the police @ CAPS1 again. The ride was cold shoateng the cat. Was it a water ride that we wated. More than @ NUM1 hours to continue if so. Was boring after that we continued. The cowrcscrowe it was fun.
A start @ TIME1 to @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION1 for a @ ORGANIZATION1 skating competition that I completed. I was waiting to know if I made it to the @ DATE1 part of the event. I had finished. It was seven o'clock in @ TIME1 when we left the rink. We went for a bite to eat and returned to the rink when we were done. My best friend @ PERSON1 was also at the same event I attended. I knew she would be going to @ DATE1, but I wasn't sure if I would or not. After an endless wait, they were about to call the people who had done so. I kept repeating in my head the number I had been given. They called @ PERSON1's number. I expected my number to always be called, but they never called it. I had not succeeded. I was disappointed, but there was nothing I could do about it.
@ CAPS1, @ CAPS1 is a huge past of life ?? While you have problems and obstacles, it makes you a good person. To have @ CAPS1 that ??? at ??? to do the job which has a long process you might have to wait for an example, i have to have @ CAPS1 all the time. for like soccer, hockey and all the active things i do you must have @ CAPS1. As you know, adults probably have more @ CAPS1 than teens like me. like i have to sit in my awning with my dad all day! As he does, that never happens. Now when I'm older and grown up I hope I have a lot more @ CAPS1 and can sit blind all day with my dad. I also have to say I'm improving with @ CAPS1, because my dad preaches and preaches to me about @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 I hope when I am an adult I can have some good @ CAPS1 like my daddy .
To be honest, I'm not a very patient person, but once I've been, I'm not quite sure how. I was waiting in line to pay for headphones. I loved these headphones, they were blue, my favorite color. So I waited @ NUM1 minutes then @ NUM2 then I lost track of time but I knew it was long. Then the cashiers had problems with the cash registers. So I waited longer and longer until some people tried to fix it. Then I had to wait even longer. Guess I stood in this queue for over an hour. I absolutely loved these headphones, but even though I wanted them, I couldn't wait. I have "@ CAPS1" and put the headphones aside and left the store. I was really angry that day. Two weeks later we came back, luckily the headphones were right where I had put them. Yes!!
One day my mother was very patient. We were outside of that talking to each other. My grandmother and grandfather called to see if we wanted to go to their place. Of course, my mother said " yes ". So I went to pack some things to take away because they didn't have anything. So when we got in the car, we turned on the radio and everything was fine. It was fine for five minutes until traffic was blocked in my sub. I was fine until I do a test called my cousins were there. I was so angry but my mom kept her eyes on the road. I kept screaming and telling mum to go faster, but she ignored me. It was as if it went from ear to ear. Then I got a text saying we were going to play soccer in @ NUM1 min. he asked me when are you gonna be here? I said "I don't know" of course my brother was already there because he passed the @ TIME1. It was a bad @ TIME1. I was still trying to tell mom to hurry, but I didn't listen. So I was going to ignore it. It didn't work because she wasn't speaking. So I fell asleep at @ NUM2. I thought I was gone I sleep forever, but I woke up @ NUM3 in one place. I was devastated. I screamed out the window and said "why". Then I went back to bed. When I slept, I felt the car go faster. All the traffic was gone, until we turned the corner and got stuck, in traffic again. I asked my mother how long I had not answered. So I shouted her again and she shouted back " here ". I looked out the window and there we were. And I got to play football. Then I heard my mother laughing in the house. I don't know why she wasn't speaking. Maybe she wanted to see her mom and dad. I never found out. It was when my mother was a patient.
Some time ago my friends and I created a @ CAPS2 game called "@ CAPS1 n go @ CAPS2". I had just taken an excellent sniper position. I had a good angle in all directions except one. The great thing about this place was that everyone walked past to get around in the woods, @ CAPS3 usually didn't require any patience. This is the part I got it wrong. I ended up waiting over twenty minutes until I saw one of the people playing. I aimed my gun and fired, @ CAPS4 by the rules, he was now on my team and under my command. We waited a while before seeing another player walking near us. Then my partner got up to shoot his gun at the other player and got shot. He didn't notice me when I walked away from him, @ CAPS3 I was safe. The only problem now was that I needed a new place for @ CAPS1 @ CAPS6 I found one quickly. Again, I waited over twenty minutes. Finally, I saw another player and got ready to shoot. When I finally got my gun from the ground, the person was gone. It made me see how long I have waited @ CAPS3 and didn't have a single person on my team. I got up and went to get someone for my team. I was looking for my patience and was getting frustrated. "@ CAPS7 anyone even here?" I whispered "@ CAPS8 ! Got you @ CAPS9 !" someone shouted from above. Then @ PERSON1 jumped from a tree. He told me he was looking at me all the time. He was waiting for me to get close enough to shoot. All the while, he waited with just enough patience to shoot each person one by one.
I once got a cool game @ CAPS1 it was so awesome. And my mom said we would have it on Friday. It was @ DATE1 and it was such a part for her to work. And she came home and said we were fine on stater day. I was a little crazy. Bat how cares. But yeah we got the game the next start day I couldn't believe I was patient
One patent holder in my life is my mother. Aicason my mom is patient because she always drives me to football events. Football practice friends at home and other places if I need to go. She also spends money on our football, our hobbies and other things that we need or want sometimes. She is never sure and is always nice when she is sad or angry and takes a long time to do things for us. Also, whenever we have trouble in school she helps us study, an example of most of these occurrences would be that she spends @ MONEY1 on our sports every year and that doesn't include extra stuff like equipment, uniforms and team stuff. An example of her driving in places she takes us is that she spends about an hour even driving us and driving my brother to places like cross country, football and basketball, she also helps us doing our homework @ CAPS1 because when I needed help with an exam she stayed with me for corily @ NUM1 hours. Also, whenever I do poorly in school, she just encourages me to do better but is always a little discouraged because she wants me to do good. She also supports me as a vegetarian, even if that means making two meals. In conclusion, my mom is one of the most patient people I know.
Once someone else I know was patient it was when my mom was looking for a job. My mom is very, very busy. She was president of a club called @ CAPS1- @ CAPS2 for about a year or two. But now that she is no longer president, she is less busy but still has an important position that requires a lot of work. But with either job, she wasn't just making money. So she decided she would find a job. She started looking for jobs online and in newspapers and the like. She couldn't find a job that suited her. She never complained about it even though she was having trouble finding a job. She continued to watch and to watch. She continued to search for about a year until she finally found a job with @ CAPS3.CC. She is now teaching a computer class for collage or the elderly. If she had liked, she would have ended up with a job that did not please.
I hate weddings. I love when people get married, but I hate ceremonies. They are so boring. Especially long @ CAPS18 weddings that take about two hours for people just sitting there after doing nothing I'm not the most patient person so that's probably why I hate long weddings. This is a long story of patience. " Do we have to go ? " I moaned the mother @ CAPS4. "@ CAPS1 is the marriage of @ PERSON1 and it is important." "@ CAPS2." Had to surrender by putting on the new @ CAPS4 dress and getting into the car. The wedding was all wapin @ LOCATION1. It usually only takes an hour to get there, but not this time. Our family was about a quarter of the way there when they found themselves in a heavy traffic jam. "@ CAPS3 activated !" @ CAPS4's sister screamed. I just kept silent. Finally, when the traffic jam cleared, a dramatic event broke out. The road we had to take was closed. You might as well take the short path. We had just entered town next to @ LOCATION1. When we got a call from @ CAPS4 grandma. "@ CAPS5 ?" @ CAPS4 mom replied. " @ CAPS7 are you ? The ceremony has just ended ", " @ CAPS8. It's bad. We are at @ LOCATION2, why? Has the @ CAPS9 reception already been received ? " " @ CAPS10, but I'm sure you arrive in time to be there, " " @ CAPS11. It's good. @ CAPS12. " " @ CAPS12. " @ CAPS13, like us, he reached the reception. I was so happy to be there even though I hate weddings. “ @ CAPS14 do you have @ CAPS16 ? ” @ CAPS4 mom asked as we got home. “@ CAPS16 ? I asked. “ @ CAPS17, guess I @ CAPS14, even the car ride was sort of @ CAPS16. ” @ CAPS18 ? You tend not to be the patient type. "@ CAPS1" I said and was proud.
A few weeks ago we had a garage sale and a mom to mom sale. I had to be patient with customers driving by or mum-to-mum selling when we had to wait for people to come to our table. At the garage sale, I made a lemonade sale. On both sales we made a lot of money, but we still had to take some stuff home and give it away. The sales were fun, but we had to go over everything and assess the price. So we just sat there but, sometimes I was happy because people had bought the stuff we had fun doing a mommy-to-mum sale and a garage sale! I think we made pretty god! We sold some things, but we still had some left to pack up and take home to donate. We had to do a lot of work but I liked it a lot!
A long time ago, when I was in third grade, I had a friend @ PERSON2 whose mother was in a bad mood. She never laughed and she never smiled. Every time I saw her I would smile at her and all she did was frown and keep walking. At first I didn't know she was cranky, I just thought she didn't like me or something. When @ PERSON2 told me her mom was cranky, I started laughing and laughing. He asked me what was so funny I told him I thought his mom didn't like me or something because every time I saw his mom I smiled at her and all she was. was doing it was frowning and walking away. It made my friend laugh, we broke down so much that we got into trouble in class. The next day @ PERSON2 and I were having lunch at school when he said <hey you're good enough at making people laugh>. I said <no i'm not my jokes are horrible>. He said <@ CAPS1 lets put them to the test and someone new at this school>. I said @ CAPS1 so we scoured the whole school looking for a new student, unfortunately we couldn't find one, we heard the bell ringing and we ran to our class. We sat at the back of the classroom, his only @ PERSON2 and me and an empty seat between us. We were excited because our teacher @ PERSON1 was going to show us a movie. @ PERSON1 got to the front of the room and the class today I have an announcement that we have a new student in our class saying hello to @ LOCATION1. @ ORGANIZATION1 walked through the door. @ PERSON1 told @ ORGANIZATION1 that she can sit in the back between @ PERSON2 and me. She sat down facing the both of us and said hello. @ PERSON2 gave me a look that said tell him the joke and @ CAPS3 gave him a thumbs up. I turned to @ LOCATION1 and said hello, I'm @ CAPS4, do you want to hear a joke. @ ORGANIZATION1 said yes of course. I started <@ CAPS5 knockshe said <who's there i said <booshe said <boo who? I said <oh don't cry, I'm here>. At first she didn't laugh because she didn't understand, but in the middle of the movie she said <ohhhh I understand and she started to laugh. @ PERSON2 turned to me and said <I told you>. @ PERSON2 had this crazy idea that if I spent the night at his place I could make his mother laugh or at least make her smile. I said <@ CAPS1 looks like a plan>. I asked mum if it was @ CAPS1 if I could spend the night at @ PERSON2's house, she said <yes just make sure it's @ CAPS1 with her mom>. @ PERSON2 asked her mom she said it was @ CAPS1. When I first got to @ PERSON2 the first thing we did was play video games. At dinner time we all sat at the table to eat @ PERSON2 and I was on one side and his parents on the other. When we started eating @ PERSON2 told me to tell his parents the joke I said @ CAPS1. So I told them <@ CAPS5 @ CAPS5> they said <who's there, I said <boothey said <boo who? I said <oh don't cry, I'm here>. Her parents started to laugh and laugh, and they continued to laugh for about five minutes. @ PERSON2 turned to me and shouted it was working, her mom asked what was working. @ PERSON2 explained everything to them. Her mother told us that her mother had recently passed away and that is why she was in a bad mood. After dinner we went to bed and fell asleep. The next morning, when my mother came to pick me up, she asked me how the night went. I said it was fun making people laugh. She said @ CAPS1 but the laughter isn't going to help you clean your room, I could tell that was dammit. FIN
Softball has to be one of the greatest sports alive; playing softball in college has always been a goal of mine. I love the dirt that sticks to your face, the sweat that runs off your forehead and the gallons and gallons of water you pour yourself all over the place to stay cool in the blisters @ CAPS2. While I love softball, I think the memories you gain from time spent with your teammates are the things you remember the most throughout your softball career. I have always had great memories through softball, lots of laughs, tears and frustrations so when I got the opportunity to play for a top notch team I looked forward to all the many others. memories that I would have. Hood @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 was the name of my team, I had played for almost four years with this local team. A lot of these girls were like sisters to me, they had treated me amazingly throughout my years playing with them. I felt like I had my film crew, I was going to play with these girls all through high school and we would become even closer. As my fifth year approached I couldn't wait, but when my dad got the idea that I might be playing for a team not so local, that idea was also very appealing. I was now faced with a big dilemma of staying with the team I knew so well and continuing to play with them until the end of high school; or playing with a team I didn't know anything about, playing with girls who might not like me, girls who were so much better than me, and who looked down on me. Looking at the pros and cons of the two teams, I decided no ; I would stay with the team I knew so well and stay comfortable where I was. At that point, softball was just around the corner and I started to reanalyze everything. Did I really want to stay and be comfortable? Or maybe challenge myself to become a better player ; maybe I could work pretty hard and get the scouts at college to watch me and hopefully get me to play for them later. So I decided to take my chances and try for this team. As my dad and I drove to the field where I was going to try for this team, my stomach was in a knot. I wanted this team to like me, I played in every way possible in my head, I could greet them so that I didn't sound snobbish or cranky. Time was passing quickly and I would have liked it to slow down; my heart felt like it was beating a million times a second. I was so nervous that my mouth started to feel sticky and taste weird, shortly after my mouth went dry, no taste, no flavor, just a sticky mess. The car was at a standstill at the time, my father looked at me and just said "ready or not, we're coming". Nervousness started to take over my body, my arms were shaking uncontrollably and I was guessing every move I made, I even had a hard time removing my seat belt. As I approached the field I felt the weather was slowing down, as I walked by I saw all the girls turn their heads to see what new fresh meat had arrived. My first thought was to run; This is it I didn't want to go, I was done I wanted home I was ready to start my year with @ CAPS2, I just couldn't take it. As I walked onto the field, they all developed a smile. Each of them told me his name, his favorite color and a funny little anecdote about himself. I found myself laughing during my entire essay, there were no awkward moments and I enjoyed my time there. I couldn't wait to go back, I had now made new friends, friends that I knew I would become close to. My year with this team has been incredible. I have friendships with these girls that I would never have discovered if I hadn't been there. These girls are like family, and the coaches even more so. Laughter played a really big part in the decision I made to play with this team, if I had just gone to give it a try, and if I hadn't had fun and laughed, I would have decided to play with the @ CAPS2. I had good memories with @ CAPS2, but also softball is about going out and finding new friendships; therefore, enjoy sports as well as people.
Some people like to make people laugh, I love that. I will do almost anything to have a good laugh. I'm going to make fun of myself, do incredibly stupid things, and sometimes hurt myself (not in a serious way). When I was little, I didn't really understand laughter. For some strange reason, I could never tell the difference if people were laughing at or laughing at something. I was a little "special" in certain areas when I was a child (I still am today). Still at the age of five, I loved making people laugh, and being special, I would do even crazier things for a laugh. Notice I was kind of a spaz, and a really big spaz. I was the most hyperactive five-year-old you could ever meet. For example, once I hit my head with a hammer, another time I was dancing in class with a pencil in my hand, stabbed myself in the head with it and needed stitches. One of the craziest moments however was a few days before I had to take pictures and wanted to go play outside, my mom knowing how "special" I was (I got it from). would not allow me. The expert persuasive child that I was at the time convinced her to let me out. Before I could even reach the street, I fell head first to the corner of the sidewalk, leaving a huge mark and completely ruining the footage. While this might make some people laugh, this is a story about laughing, not me as a spaz. Now that you know I love making people laugh, I'm "special", and a perfect spaz, I can continue with the story. Well I was in kindergarten and loved school because I was hanging out with my friends and playing with blocks, it might sound silly but I was in kindergarten. The only thing I didn't like about kindergarten was being bully. Surprisingly, I never had a bully except in kindergarten, but he was a bad bully. He was giving me wedges at story time and all the stuff (which was the best time to do it because the teacher couldn't see). I still know the bully too, but he's not a bully anymore, he's a good boy now, which seems strange to me. Either way, kindergarten has been a really good year for me except for one day (and every day I had wedgies). That's the day this whole thing is about, that's why I told you I like to make people laugh, why I told you I'm "special", and a spaz, all in there The story revolves around this day, * dramatic break * in kindergarten. It started like any other day in kindergarten. I woke up, went through my daily routine, hopped in the car, and headed for school. When I got to school, I grabbed my daily binder and tapped the education panel like a mall cop would tap the observation and report panel. I did all of my work and colored (which was basically all of my work). It happened at the break, so we ran around the playground and had a little snack. When we finished removing the last drops from our juice boxes, we headed for story time. We were all in the little circle (which looked more like a warped oval) listening to the story, just as I stepped into the story and lost my guard, I got an excruciatingly painful wedgie (for a five year old) ). The story was almost over and our attention span of five years was slim and we were getting all excited. The story finally ended and we were on our feet, and that's where my memory begins to fade. I made a really funny joke and the whole kindergarten class burst out laughing, me being a "special" spaz who can't tell if people are laughing at me or with me bursting into tears. I remember closing my eyes at the drinking fountain trying to hide my tears. One of the teachers tried to help me by telling me that they were making fun of my joke. It took me a few minutes to stop crying but a little longer to realize that they weren't making fun of me. To this day classmates still remind me of that day sure I can laugh about it now but it was in kindergarten I'm in ninth grade now and people remember it's a bit crazy for me. It was a negative experience back then, but it turned into a blessing in disguise. It made me become a better person, I can tell the difference between laughing and also being okay when people laugh at me (doing stupid things to make people laugh at me is actually my forte). So remember that sometimes being " special " can be the best thing about you, what makes you who you are, what makes you great, what makes you grow taller, what makes people laugh.
" LAUGH " @ CAPS1 I hang out with my friends, the only thing we do best is laugh sometimes for no reason. The thing we tend to laugh at is stumbling across trash cans, laundry or maybe even what we ate for dinner on @ TIME1 before. @ CAPS1 I am usually stressed out, the only thing I like is going out with my friends. they are usually good listeners. globally. Although they distract you. So with my friends you can count on having a good time whatever the occasion. @ CAPS1 I say trash I really mean trash I remember once in the hallway at school my friend was hanging on to my backpack because she tends to get lost in the hall a lot because I walk a lot faster so she, anyway, the class bell had just blushed and all the students were heading for lunch that we were. I was just about to cross the hallway and she told me not to do it, so I made no one stop ! so she kinda slipped into a trash can that was hanging on the wall in the hallway, she @ MOIS1 dropped it but I can't really tell? I was still walking and the sound effects were so funny I still laughed about it. My friend and I have a joke inside? we went out for lunch together. @ CAPS1 we saw a laundry buddy and I went crazy we made up a fun joke and said we should make our own aprons with lots of colors and rhinestones that way if we wanted to do all our laundry in same time time. We would take our clothes off there and put on our so-called aprons. And do our laundry like nothing has happened. @ CAPS1 our laundry was done, we said we could choose a new outfit because everything would be clean. yes we're weird but that's what makes us laugh more than anything is being stupid at a made-up story like that. Now about the food it's kinda like laundry but guess it's better? I remember @ CAPS1 I got to school the next day I just started talking about what I had for dinner @ TIME1 I think at that point my mom asked us if we wanted chicken @ PERSON1 and my sister as i was screaming and saying hell yeah ? so dinner was ready and @ CAPS1 we went to the site to the table, we looked at it and it was not what we expected? it was frozen in a box and it looked like someone had eaten the food before throwing it up ? it was so beautiful. All these things that have been named or talked about is how my life is almost everyday @ CAPS1 there is no drama i love my friend i dont think i could have asked better because all we do is laugh and have fun in a trash bin and whatever else but the one thing that matters most with my only friend is that @ CAPS1 we fight, we can't stay mad at each other, well now that I can't. So at the end of the day, I ask him, are we done with each other? and that we were just looking at each other laughing because that was all we could do because the reason was so stupid that there really was no need for it. but just for fun and fooling around. not just anyone else, but are we @ CAPS1 sometimes that we have really awkward days ? we invent the story of our laundry. talking about my life with my friends is nothing better than laughing because deep down inside you a friend will look back and say wow those the best day was @ CAPS1 - would be in trouble in class for talking too much .
Well I'm telling a story about when I had @ CAPS3 in town. When I was heading down town to meet a body, it was cold, dark, and just scary. So on my way there I thought I had gone too far, so I took the bus and thought to myself where am I? I was confused and like what the hell. Then I ask someone where am I, man said you were downtown. So I just called thenm and see if she was on the phone ringing then she picks up. Where were you i said she said down tonw i was like oh my god i know but no matter she was like where you were so i said some were downtown. Then she said stupid @ CAPS2 on the bus and got off more so I waited like @ NUM1, then the bus came in and I was happy. Then i called her saying i'm on the bus on the way she said ok @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 she said i was laughing and said ok i won't. When I @ CAPS2 there they laughed at me and I was like it wasn't funny I could have been snacked or raped or it could have been even more serious. Well thats what you @ caps2 they said i was like yes yes i know anything lol. Later that night it was like I didn't want candy so they showed me how @ CAPS2 at the store is so I was like going and the last words I heard were @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 ! I smiled. Well on my way to the store I was cold and listening to music then I @ CAPS2 at the store and look around then my phone rings. Hello I said it was that girl she said I just wanted to make sure you weren't @ CAPS3 I said I had this I am not going @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. @ NUM2 minutes later I walked out and looked around like I was ?? I was like oh no not yet i just started walking where i come from and i didn't see the pipe so i went the other way and i was like that so i am again @ CAPS3? Yes I am. so i didn't want her to know i was @ CAPS3 so i didn't call her and tried to find my own way but couldn't so i just tried to think then @ NUM3 minutes elapsed, she called. Sooo ... Darrio she said i answer what she said hannin @ CAPS3 eh? I laughed no why you said I asked that she was like I'm looking at you and you're going the wrong way, I looked back and started laughing. She came up to me and told me you were @ CAPS3 i said no i was just getting some air she was like yeah okay darrio you were with a smile i thought next time i would ask her to come with me I smiled. When we got to her house they laughed again and I just said okay I had @ CAPS3 and we all laughed for about @ NUM4 minutes then relax. Then I felt like it was hot in here then I opened the window they said it was cold so I was okay I closed the window and I am out for a minute. My phone rings I pick up the girl said @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 I was like I'm shut up I'm not on the porch she said soo ... said and we all laughed. Then that hole night was about to lose me and not know where I was going and yeah that's it.
@ CAPS3 I'm going to tell @ CAPS18 a little story. I remember a time when @ CAPS11 cousin @ PERSON1 @ CAPS3 I decided to make a snowman in @ CAPS11's house at @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION2. I tell him, I'm bored, @ CAPS1 does @ CAPS18 want to do? "@ PERSON1 replies," @ CAPS2 is going to make a snowman. "@ CAPS3 I agree that would be fun. @ CAPS34 start looking for a jacket @ CAPS3 gloves, but I stop it @ CAPS3 say, "@ CAPS1 does @ CAPS18 get them?" "@ CAPS5 is not cold @ CAPS20." "@ CAPS6," replies @ PERSON1. "@ CAPS33 didn't say I didn't warn @ CAPS18." We start our snowman by building the base (the bigger piece for the bottom). @ CAPS3 after about @ NUM1 minutes , base is almost done, but we notice we're cold. ”@ CAPS7 should we go inside?” @ PERSON1 said. “@ CAPS8, me @ CAPS7 mom will even make us hot chocolate.” @ CAPS9 we go back inside hoping for some deliciously hot hot chocolate. I see @ CAPS11 mom @ CAPS3 asking, "@ CAPS10 we have hot chocolate please?" "@ CAPS11 @ CAPS18 look cold, okay sure i will make it @ CAPS18. "@ CAPS9 @ PERSON1 @ CAPS3 I sit downstairs eagerly awaiting our hot chocolate by the radiator to get hot. "@ CAPS5 is ready !" @ CAPS11 mom is calling from the top of the stairs. We go down the corridor @ CAPS3 we rush down the stairs. @ CAPS3 to our amazement we find not only hot chocolate but a bag of crisps like @ CAPS28. "@ CAPS14 mom!" I said. “@ CAPS14 @ CAPS16 @ CAPS17!” Says @ PERSON1. "@ CAPS18 are welcome boys" says @ CAPS11 mom. @ PERSON1 @ CAPS3 I sit at the table @ CAPS3 start drinking our hot chocolate, while @ CAPS11 mom puts crisps on paper napkins for us. I start to eat the chips in handfuls while @ PERSON1 takes one, only one. I ask him : "@ CAPS19, did @ CAPS18 take only one @ PERSON1 ?" @ CAPS20 out of the corner of my eye @ CAPS34 looks at me @ CAPS3 slowly brings the chip to his mouth @ CAPS3 takes a bite. As @ CAPS34 did, I fell @ CAPS20 off the @ CAPS11 chair in a hysterical burst of laughter. @ CAPS11 mom hears the thud of me hitting the ground @ CAPS3 goes up the stairs to find me laughing. "@ CAPS1 is @ CAPS9 funny ?" she asks. I tell @ PERSON1, "@ CAPS22 her." @ PERSON1 then conforms @ CAPS3 grabs another @ CAPS3 chip while @ CAPS34 watches her out of the corner of his eye, slowly brings @ CAPS5 to his mouth @ CAPS3 takes a bite. I start laughing again, but @ CAPS11 mom doesn't see the humor. It simply asks : "@ CAPS23 do @ CAPS9's funny ? " @ PERSON1 replies "I have no idea but @ CAPS34 is about to die laughing. I start to stop laughing @ CAPS3 I am able to stand up again. I then say to @ CAPS11 mom, “@ CAPS5 is the way @ CAPS34 looks @ CAPS18, @ CAPS5 just makes @ CAPS18 laugh.” Then I have @ CAPS35 to do the same, but no effect on @ PERSON1. ” Does @ CAPS19 not work with @ CAPS5? "I ask. Awesome like this @ CAPS3 @ CAPS18're @ NUM2 says. " @ CAPS6, @ CAPS28, I will stay at @ CAPS5 until @ CAPS5 be correct. " @ CAPS9 I @ CAPS35 to imitate everything I saw him do, but to no avail. All I did was spill hot chocolate @ CAPS11 on myself , which made him laugh, even though it wasn't like I wanted. "@ CAPS18 wants me to @ CAPS22 @ CAPS18 ?" @ PERSON1 said. "@ CAPS31 !!!! Please! " I beg. " @ CAPS6, @ CAPS33 not saying I didn't warn @ CAPS18. " @ CAPS34 then proceeds to enter another @ CAPS3 chip while looking at me from the corner eye, bite chip. I start laughing uncontrollably then @ CAPS3 without pause. After about @ NUM1 minutes, I stop laughing. “ I'll get there ! ” I say. @ PERSON1 says “@ CAPS35 @ CAPS5. "I catch a chip @ CAPS3 looking at him straight @ CAPS3 bites, nothing. I have @ CAPS35 again, this time looking at him out of the corner of @ CAPS11's eye, nothing again. I @ CAPS7 for myself - even, "@ CAPS36 I @ CAPS33 don't get @ CAPS5 this time, I'm giving up." "@ CAPS6, there you go." I grab a @ CAPS3 chip and slowly bring @ CAPS5 to @ CAPS11's mouth while squinting out of the corner of @ CAPS11's eye. I bite the chip. I notice @ CAPS34's laughter. @ CAPS34 is laughing !!! "I told @ CAPS18 I would have @ CAPS5 !" "@ CAPS31, @ CAPS31 @ CAPS18 did it. " @ CAPS3 this is one of the many times laughter has brought together @ CAPS11 @PERSON's cousin 1 @ CAPS3 I. "
My best friend, @ PERSON1 and I have been close since we were @ NUM1. We met during @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 classes at our local dance studio. We have stayed close over the years as we have always done similar activities. Yet we are very different from each other. I am more outside, I like to say what I think and I am more carefree. @ CAPS4 is the opposite. @ CAPS4 is very conservative and @ CAPS4 can take things too seriously. But anyway, we manage to balance ourselves. Finals week had just ended and @ LOCATION1 and I had planned a slumber party all week. We just needed time to relax and have time for ourselves. When I got home from school, I gave him a quick call. "@ CAPS3 ?" @ CAPS4 responded. "@ CAPS5, @ CAPS12 time did @ CAPS16 want to go out ?" I asked. " Was I thinking of @ NUM2 ?" " " @ CAPS6 good ! " I quickly hung up the phone and gathered my gear. I grabbed my toothbrush, pillow, pajamas, and blanket. I put on my shoes and walked back out the door. My dad dropped me off with all my gear. I had brought my pajamas, my pillow and an extra blanket. I walked up her sidewalk to her door, knocked and waited. Seconds later @ CAPS4 responded with a big smile on their face. @ CAPS4 led me to his basement where @ CAPS4 had prepared all the junk food ready to be attacked. @ CAPS4 had gone to the store earlier today and bought everything. @ CAPS4 had everything set up on their old pool table that no one was using. There were chips, cookies, soda, candy, chocolate and pizza. I put my things on the chair in the corner of the room and we feasted. Of course, we could eat all the food. We just weren't big enough. After eating for almost an hour at a stretch, we lay down on the floor of his basement trying to regain our composure. We started laughing at the silly little things that appeared in the commercials on his big screen @ CAPS7. Eventually we started talking about how each of our finals has gone. “I did so well on all of mine! I'm going to have ALL A's” @ PERSON1 boasted. @ CAPS4 has earned A's every year since college. "I think I've done quite a bit of @ CAPS8 as well, not so sure about an @ NUM3 though." I said as I was lying upside down on the floor. "@ CAPS8, we'll see tomorrow!" We finally decided to move to the couch on the other side of the pool table, so we could face @ CAPS7. It was already @ NUM4 in @ TIME1 and we were still on a high sugar level. We alternated between watching an old horror movie and the best @ NUM5 clips of the week. It had been a while and before we knew it it was @ NUM2 in @ TIME1. @ PERSON1 and I were lying on top of each other. Every once in a while one of us would get crisps or candy on the table. We have become so tired that we cannot keep our eyes open. No one even had enough energy to turn off the overhead light. We fell asleep quickly. When I woke up the next @ TIME1, @ PERSON1 was no longer lying in front of me. @ CAPS4 was sitting in the corner chair where I had put my things. I looked at the time, and it was already @ NUM4: 30 in the afternoon. I looked back and @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS4 looked a little upset. I moved under my blanket so I could face him. "@ CAPS5 ..." I growled, stretching. "@ TIME1." @ CAPS4 said sharply. @ CAPS4 held a folded piece of paper in his hand. "@ CAPS12 is activated ?" I asked, sitting down on the sofa. @ CAPS4 crumpled up the piece of paper and threw it at me. I took it on my lap and unfolded it. It was his newsletter. I went through the diary looking at all of his notes. @ CAPS4 had received all As ... and a @ CAPS13. @ CAPS4 had obtained an @ CAPS13 in its @ CAPS15 class. I looked up from the paper to see his hands covering his face. I approached her a little amused by @ CAPS4's anger. "@ CAPS16 has a @ CAPS13 ... and @ CAPS16 is crying?" I asked. @ CAPS4 looked at me quickly. I looked at her with a stupid face and @ CAPS4 burst out laughing. @ CAPS4 felt so stupid for crying on @ NUM8 @ CAPS13. I started to laugh too. I knew my grades were much worse. Heck, I'd be happy to get @ CAPS13. @ PERSON1 and I are perfect best friends. We equalize. I tell him to clear up and @ CAPS4 tells me to focus more. @ CAPS16 can't take little things like this too seriously, it's just not worth the stress. Sometimes @ CAPS16 just needs to relax and focus. @ CAPS16 must find your perfect balance between work and play.
Laughter is a great thing to have in any relationship you are in, whether it's a friendship, a romantic relationship, or a working relationship. Either way, you need to laugh so that you don't hug yourself so tight that it's not fun to be around. Every once in a while, a body around you in your life needs a laugh to cheer them up. people should laugh everyday because it makes you happy even when you are in a really bad mood. When you're suicidal all you really want is someone to talk to you and make you smile, laugh, and laugh. It really feels good to laugh with a friend or loved one. You like to see people smile and laugh. Your friends and family also love to see you laughing here and there every now and then. So every once in a while, laugh for once and be happy even if it's only for a few seconds in your life. Laughter is an important thing to have in your life. It's nice to laugh and laugh even when life gets you down and shitty. Everyone needs to laugh in order not to become so grumpy and insufferable. So please forever love around you and in your life please laugh. Come on, you know you wanna laugh. Hahaha. Hope that at least made you smile a bit. In any relationship that you have or are laughing at is one important thing that you need in a relationship. Always try to laugh here and there and you'll be doing just fine in life no matter how fucked up life is that moment you laugh.
I believe that with everyone, laughter and a good sense of humor is something that everyone has in common, everyone enjoys sharing with others. For young teenage girls, laughter is contagious but still wonderful. It's the purest joy we have, it's something that brings humans together. It is the beginning and the end of friendship and unity. Laughter can erupt and lift the spirits of those who really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst of days feel a little better. We all know this feeling of dread and sadness. Kindness, generosity and a good laugh are one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression, the simple joy of laughing can erase a person's worries for a fraction of a second and fill us with utter warmth. @ PERSON1 and I have been best friends since we were ten years old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @ PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other laugh when all we want is to be angry or just cry. We decided that other than we're just a little bit funny, but with our powers combined, we could make anyone laugh. We use this power over each other when we're having a bad day, or we just need to cheer ourselves up. I think if it wasn't for fun, we wouldn't even be friends anymore. This is really what brings us together as best friends. We would be different people. Even if I walked away from her, we would still be making jokes, hurting each other's guts and crying from laughing so hard. My first impression of @ PERSON1 was seeing her stomping around in our neighborhood park yelling at her sister, who I was playing with at the time. It would be a very explicit reason why I didn't like him at first. Fortunately, after going to @ PERSON1 with her sister, @ PERSON1 and I found that we had a lot in common and were only four months apart. That kind of childish coaxing kept our friendship going, as it was a bit rocky at first. Always fighting and arguing over things that now we look back and laugh at our teenage stupidity. Either of us would make stupid little comments when neither of us wanted to apologize. She once told me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remember things like that and have a great time laughing about it. We were then only @ NUM1 years old. Now, almost @ NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the most of what we have having fun. Laughter was definitely the dressing at the start of our rickety friendship. @ PERSON1 has a knack for doing anything funny anytime. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think what the human race would be like if laughter weren't a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows it wasn't a good day if you didn't laugh - let alone smile. People would be boring and just miserable. Laughter cures people of illness, it makes us feel that maybe everything will be fine after all. I really think it's healthy for you. With the flip of a switch, laughter can bring about a feeling of ecstasy and luck. People take it for granted and misuse it when it is supposed to spread the word of happiness. We are fortunate to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, what feeling laughter really brings to us ? I do not think so. It's like describing the smell of something. You can not do that. The words are not there. I think of those poor and miserable people who have forgotten what it is to laugh, and it is very sad. I strive to laugh every day and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a rough diamond like laughter? It is not a lifetime at all, for laughter will always be your refuge in the pursuit of happiness.
Laughter, one of the greatest gifts in life. Have you ever laughed so hard you cried? What about the laughter so loud that you can't breathe or the noise that no longer comes out of your lips ? I'm the type of person who can @ CAPS6 at something so stupid that when I'm done laughing I don't even know why I started laughing in the first place. I can @ CAPS6 so hard that nothing comes out at all ! @ CAPS1 is amazing what laughter can do to a person's heart. The way @ CAPS1 makes you feel, the way @ CAPS1 makes you act. @ CAPS1 is so contagious, and @ CAPS1 is happening around us everyday. We're never too old to laugh, @ CAPS1 happens to the best of us. young or old, @ CAPS1 doesn't matter. Laughter has no age. Once @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 and I stood up to three in the @ TIME1. We were so delusional and crazy we were acting like crazy. We now have the type of relationship where we can @ CAPS6 to almost anything. Literally almost anything ... While we were standing we drank lots of soda and ate sugary foods to fuel us for the night. We composed songs, we danced in @ CAPS2's house and @ CAPS1 felt like laughing for hours ! I laughed until tears flowed from @ CAPS2's eyes, and I couldn't breathe with @ CAPS2's lungs. When @ CAPS1 laughs silently, @ CAPS1 is even funnier because that person can't control @ CAPS1, and they look so hilarious because they are rocking back and forth, with that silly expression on their face, without making any noise at all. Have you ever laughed for what feels like a lifetime? How did you feel after this " life " of laughing ? @ CAPS1 almost feels like something as powerful as the sun just heats up on your heart and soul. When I @ CAPS6, I feel all the happiness and emotions flowing throughout @ CAPS2's body. @ CAPS1 is one of the greatest feelings in the world, I really can't think of a feeling greater than the warmth of laughter. @ CAPS1 is so great when you and a @ CAPS3 or a group of friends can sit back and enjoy the laughter you share. Even when you're feeling down, you might need to cheer yourself up. You can always count on a @ CAPS6 to help you. Whatever mood I'm in, @ CAPS5 I hear someone laughing, @ CAPS1 is so hard not to participate. Laughter is so contagious ! @ CAPS1 affects us in our daily life. I bet you can't go a day without hearing someone @ CAPS6, or laughing yourself. I probably have @ CAPS6 about five hundred times a day, @ CAPS5 no more. I love hearing people @ CAPS6, @ CAPS1 light up the mood @ CAPS2 and also @ CAPS2 day. I would definitely say that laughter is very important and beneficial for a relationship. I mean imagine the world without laughing. Boring, right? Advice @ CAPS2, @ CAPS6 like you've heard the funniest thing in the world. @ CAPS6 as if there was no tomorrow. Never mind @ CAPS5, people think it's stupid. You will feel much better after having this tear induced, hard to breathe, silent but so therapeutic @ CAPS6. Laughter is really the shortest distance between people!
Laughter Laughter expresses pleasure, amusement or the object of a joke. Laughter is something we all do, it is a great benefit in our life and it has happened daily. Without laughter, we couldn't express our cheerful and open side, we wouldn't have any special feelings in life except frowning which is a proven fact to reduce more wrinkles due to the number. of extra muscle he uses. For me laughing is a thing all day long, @ CAPS1, my friends, family and horses are my main reason my frown is turned inside out. You @ MONTH1 think horses can't smile or talk, but @ CAPS2 has their own way of showing a personality that will make you laugh. Shere @ CAPS2 are all smart, but @ CAPS2 can be awkward or awkward at times. Most of the time @ CAPS2 just makes you laugh and laugh like your own little siblings. There is this time that I will always have locked up in the back of my head. It took place on a @ DATE1 in the middle of the day at the beach on the @ ORGANIZATION1. I was with my friend and we both had our two horses saddled up, ready to go. We and our horses felt the energy soar as we saw the waves crashing onto the shore with the salty smell in our noses. Once we hit the sand we were running side by side with the wind whistling past our ears like a moving train. The heads of the horses were also pointed towards the ocean. When we got to the water the horses pranced and danced like yearlings again, @ CAPS2 was walking in the water saying it was flooding us both and then as soon as the next wave rushed in we were doing a gap and trying to beat the wave to shore. After about five hours of cave, sand dune, and starfish adventures we were all exhausted and then decided to be done with it. It was around dinner time so we had dinner watching the sun go down to end the perfect day at the beach. We put the horses back in the trailer, and before closing the trailer door I gave my horse a good pat on the neck, just as I was about to come out, my horse turned its head , then nudged me as he said "thanks for the great time". Coming home, I knew it was a perfect day because of the laughs, and all the times I just laughed for fun, my face hurt a little bit because of that smile as well.
Starting a story with two old boys @ NUM1 @ DATE1 named @ ORGANIZATION1 can already be considered a comedy. These are the names of my cousins identical twins @ Organization1 I can honestly admit that they are @ NUM2 of the funniest kids I know. My uncle isn't exactly the smartest human on earth, @ ORGANIZATION1 from the way he named his kids, it's obvious his sense of humor is a bit offbeat, but he's a very hard working man. Sometimes my mom does her favors by taking the twins off her hands for a little while because they can be a handful. Weekends are especially better to have them because of my hateful half-siblings who hate me, my brother, my sister, @ ORGANIZATION1 even my mom. The amount of tension in the house is not healthy, so a few @ NUM1 @ DATE1 old people running around enlivens it a bit @ ORGANIZATION1 makes us all laugh together as a family. It had to be @ DATE1 in @ DATE2 when @ CAPS7 was home @ ORGANIZATION1 we were building on our house when the twins arrived. My mom was getting pretty furious with their insanely high energy levels, she looked like she was about to pull all her hair out. My stepfather @ PERSON1 had to go to @ PERSON2 for nails @ ORGANIZATION1 lock the kids @ ORGANIZATION1 I decided to go with him. I thought it would have been a good idea to take the twins with us, just to relieve my mom from the loud hangovers for a few minutes. We loaded the car @ ORGANIZATION1 I drove on the freeway amused by the twins in the backseat playing with the ponies @ ORGANIZATION1 laughing at people stopped at red lights. We all sang songs like twinkle twinkle little star, @ ORGANIZATION1 les @ ORGANIZATION2 until we got to @ PERSON2's parking lot. @ ORGANIZATION1 finds it hilarious enough to browse the islands @ ORGANIZATION1 hides behind items on the lower shelves, while @ ORGANIZATION1 likes to pretend he's @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 confusing @ CAPS7. Eventually the twins were too obnoxious which caused me @ LOCATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 to catch them @ ORGANIZATION1 holding them captive in the seat belts of @ PERSON2's cart. This was helpful but didn't do as much justice as we had hoped. We continued our adventure in search of children's locks, @ ORGANIZATION1 found them on the island @ NUM4. There was a tall man standing in front of our destination @ ORGANIZATION1 when I say tall, I don't mean muscular, or tall ... I mean he probably has a few too many @ CAPS1 shows that he watches daily , @ ORGANIZATION1 maybe a few too many favorite snacks. His hair was long @ ORGANIZATION1 sand blonde, he was wearing a dark purple shirt @ CAPS2 die @ ORGANIZATION1 over slip on sandals. @ ORGANIZATION1 apparently didn't realize how inappropriate it is to talk about a person in a rude way, especially when they can hear you. He said: "@ CAPS3 cow @ ORGANIZATION1 look at this lady! She is so huge! @ ORGANIZATION1 laughed outrageously @ ORGANIZATION1 agreed. "@ CAPS4 ! She's as big as our whole car !" I freaked out a bit @ ORGANIZATION1 tried to silence them but the twins paid attention to @ CAPS5 they were much more excited to see the man on the big ladder next to me giggling @ ORGANIZATION1 laughing with them . They were silent for a while, then @ ORGANIZATION1 gasped @ ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed : "@ CAPS5 she is as big as a fire truck !" The man turned around @ ORGANIZATION1 looked at me; I apologized at least @ NUM5 times that @ ORGANIZATION1 started taking the boys off the island when the man on the ladder pressed a button to move the ladder. I was walking behind the bigger man when the ladder beeped ridiculously loud, like a construction vehicle. The boys screamed in fear @ ORGANIZATION1 shouted frantically : "@ CAPS6 run as fast as you can hurry ! She pulls back @ ORGANIZATION1, she is going to crush you to the floor !" @ CAPS7 laughed, even the man they were laughing at, but I was so embarrassed I just took them in the car @ ORGANIZATION1 waited @ PERSON1. I tried to explain to the boys in the car that only large trucks beep when backing up, but unsurprisingly they didn't listen to a word I said. @ PERSON1 only took about @ NUM6 more minutes before running out the door with the nails, the kid locks, @ ORGANIZATION1 a gigantic smile plastered on his face. I thought about what had happened in the store @ ORGANIZATION1 I laughed softly until @ PERSON1 jumped into the truck, then I started laughing profusely. When I got home I told my mom what happened she laughed for a while @ ORGANIZATION1 I laughed even harder @ ORGANIZATION1 a little longer than before. I fell asleep with a pretty huge headache that night, but I think it was worth laughing all day.
When I meet new people, everything is fine because everyone needs friends like people say friends come and go real friends wouldn't leave. I remember I met this beautiful girl who was called @ PERSON1 to me, she was not just a friend, I knew I wanted to have a life with her and be with her people, say that love can't come true but reverse it because it's the reverse of love is not going love comes from above. I remember when I first spoke to her it was like god was there to tell me that she was the right one for me and I knew I could save her from love. when i looked her in the eye for the first time it was like i felt the way her heart felt it was breaking down so i told her your heart wouldn't be broken in two because i would replace wrong with mine i told her you were the one i want the one i need the one i need to get i want to know you like no one else can know you your name is forever like a tattoo in my heart you are the apple of my tree that will never be cut i want to stay with you on a mountain and show you that i am different from other guys i am faithful like no one else can be. You are amazing the way you are I won't change a thing about you because I love everything about you I love your eyes I love your smile I love your personality so I told her to try your luck with me I know that you were thrown out so much but don't let that come in so she said yes she was so happy it was like her dream came true for her a guy who can show her that there is no like the others a guy who is always faithful and honest and sincere and who will never lie or cheat. So I told her that she was my superhuman, she was so happy that I entered her life, she said that I had changed her whole life and that she had changed mine too. my heart does not belong to anyone else because if you are not the one who has my heart, my heart will only be a toy and will break it. i told her she will never be so cold i will always warm her day and night with my arms and my body temperature it's like she is finally my wife. I told her every girl I was dating played with my heart that they weren't true to me, I wasn't living my life the way I wanted, so one day I thought to myself that this girl, even on this planet, is always honest, loyal, really, trusting and that will never lie or cheat, so i thought i would keep looking for that special girl and now i can say i found her because this girl is 'calls @ PERSON1. I told her that she would never be sad again and that she would never have a million tears rolling down her precious little face again. I told him that I would always be a phone call away, not two but one. she was so happy when i said she was my heaven my wide world she finally made my dreams come true i just want it to be me and you no one else trust me i don't trust you our love no will never die he will never fall our love will always be alive our love will stand high say it reaches the sky say the sun no longer shines. I'm crazy about her, she's crazy about me, she has the key to my heart and only she can open it, I finally know what love is like. she turned all my bad days into good days i will never break her heart she wouldn't break mine either i told her the sun doesn't shine forever but when it isn't shining just look at the stars cause they are still shining and our star is the biggest in the sky. For me you will never be gone, you will always be in my heart, my love is strong for you sitting by the phone waiting for you to call me and you always do. To me you are not just a friend, you are more than a friend, you are my angel, my daughter, my daughter, my wife, my everything until the end of the world, I realize that my love for you is strong, that's how it should be. You are more than a friend to me, you are all I need and I'm glad I found you a true story forever
People always say that laughter is an important part in a relationship. Is it true? In my opinion, I'm not so sure, but my grandmother says laughter is always a big part of a relationship. Makes you feel good when you make your best friend, parents, boyfriend or girlfriend laugh. It's the best feeling ever because you know how to make that person smile. Have you ever walked into a store and saw two couples laughing, having fun? I have and sometimes I have the impression of being in the same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandfather when they were young. She always says that "laughter plays a big part in our relationship". She was @ NUM1 and @ CAPS1 was @ NUM2 the first time they met. Everyone has always said they are never going to last, but the only way to find out is to wait and believe. She wanted to sing every time she heard his name. She said she would walk in their shadow with him. She felt like all her problems would go away, whenever she had the chance to spend time with him. Whenever she could think of him, she smiled and laughed. That's how happy she was for him. Can we call it love? I say it was, sometimes I would like to be in love like my grandmother. She looks so happy every time she talks about him, but still not sure if the laughter @ CAPS2 has kept them together for so long. I see a really big smile on my grandmother every time she says, "@ CAPS1 didn't have the brightest face in the world, but @ CAPS1 always knew how to make me smile." Because she said @ CAPS1 wasn't that smart but @ CAPS1 knew how to make jokes and make her laugh. A question she asked me once "@ CAPS2 do you think of two couples when you see them laughing, having fun". The first thing that comes to your mind is that they know how to have fun and nothing is stopping them from laughing and having fun. My grandma said the thing that kept her together with my grandpa was laughter, because if you don't know how to make the other person laugh, you don't know if you could have a good time with that person . When my grandparents are mad at each other it never lasts too long because my grandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh, they might not be together yet. I now understand that my grandma fell in love with my grandpa, because of the way @ CAPS1 made him laugh. In a relationship, you should always know how to make the other person smile because if you don't know, things just won't work. My grandmother was right, laughter plays a big part in their relationship. They always know how to improve everything by making jokes or doing something fun. I can never be mad at my grandparents because they know so many tricks to make me laugh. It's @ CAPS2 that keeps our family relationship together, as well as other families. I finally understand that laughter is an important element in a relationship.
"Laughter is the best medicine." The expression that almost everyone has heard. But it's true @ CAPS20 ! I've had days when all I could think of was how bad @ CAPS23's life was, or at least it seemed. On the days when you feel like everything is wrong and nothing could make it worse ... And that's @ CAPS20 when one of @ CAPS14's best friends will make me laugh. I'm gonna laugh so much I'm about to have @ CAPS19 @ CAPS14 pants and @ CAPS14 watery eyes. I will laugh so hard that no sound comes out, @ CAPS14 cramps on the sides and I fall to the floor. They make me laugh so much, sometimes I think even if I was in a coma they would say something so funny that I would sit straight up in the hospital bed and @ CAPS21 laughs at the huge belly laugh that escapes me sometimes. There was that particular moment when @ DATE1, @ CAPS1 and I were feeling more chuckle than usual. It tends to happen a lot when we're together, but this time it was very different from others. We staggered to @ CAPS1 '@ CAPS20's house, flushed and giddy at how funny everything was. You know what it's like when you and your best friends @ CAPS9 @ CAPS21 @ CAPS13 so tickled by each other ? Those times when you glance at your friend and @ CAPS21 as you've started to calm down, you see his pinched expression of trying not to laugh, and you lose everything again. If you've ever had the pleasure of going through those silly moments, try imagining that feeling for hours on end. I'm pretty sure I developed a whole new set of abdominal muscles that day, if that gives you any idea how strong our laughter is. Anyway, we stumbled upon his house, trying to be serious, as we had to do at least some of our homework. Of course we were hungry after all the laughter so @ CAPS1 told @ ORGANIZATION1 and myself we can get cereal. @ CAPS21 regular milk and cereal, right ? There is '@ CAPS20 nothing special @ CAPS22 about @ CAPS4'n @ CAPS5 (other than that' @ CAPS20 creepy delicious). But that day, everything was out of the ordinary, especially the milk. It was the most amazing milk I have ever tasted, and I have @ CAPS6, @ CAPS6, @ CAPS6, milk, so that must have meant something. "@ CAPS7 this milk is so good! @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14 @ CAPS8 !" @ ORGANIZATION1 exclaimed. I swear she was about to choke on her own spoon, she was eating so fast. "@ CAPS9 are you kidding me with that? What kind of milk are you buying ?!" I blurted out. For some reason this milk was truly amazing, and it seriously blew the mind of @ CAPS14. "@ CAPS10, I don't know @ CAPS17. Two percent?" @ CAPS1 looked at us in disbelief, a curious eyebrow raised at our inquiries. His expression made us all laugh. Now whenever either of us brings it up, we always laugh like @ CAPS21 has happened. @ TIME1, it happened. @ CAPS1 peed in his pants, and not a bit @ CAPS21. It was @ CAPS17 @ CAPS21 the inactive threat rushed in, the "@ CAPS12'mgoingtopee!" to yell. @ CAPS13 no. She actually peed, and I still remember @ CAPS16 '@ CAPS17 what I said to make her laugh so hard. All I know is that suddenly (scaring me halfway to death) she screamed : "@ CAPS13 @ CAPS14 @ CAPS8 I @ CAPS16 '@ CAPS17 @ CAPS18 @ CAPS19 ! IT' @ CAPS20 @ CAPS21 @ CAPS22 @ CAPS23 @ CAPS24 !! " I turned around and saw @ CAPS1, face red and mouth open, leaning against the counter. She looked like the damn @ CAPS26 @ CAPS27 from @ LOCATION1 all bent over like she was. Her eyes were closed tightly, narrowing at the corners, a few tears escaping as she tried to hold back (apparently) crippling cries of laughter. It took me a second to realize what was going on, then I was downright laughing at her; pointing and laughing @ CAPS14 shoulder chuckle, and that only made him laugh louder. Still laughing, she did a penguin-like run down the hallway to the bathroom, where @ DATE1 was. @ CAPS1, in his wet jeans and with a tear-streaked red face, burst through the bathroom door, looking slightly baffled and amused by what happened @ CAPS21. So naturally @ ORGANIZATION1 laughed at the sight of it, in its comedic delirium state. Who would @ CAPS17 ? The fact that we @ CAPS16 are always laughing at each other and ourselves is why I love @ CAPS14's friends. It's @ CAPS20 great when you have people you @ CAPS16 are laughing at about anything and everything. @ CAPS1 is practically a walking ego boost because she laughs at every joke, and @ ORGANIZATION1 '@ CAPS20 is pretty smart when it comes to thinking about it. Personally, I love to laugh, especially with (and especially with) @ CAPS14's best friends.
Once, while I was skating with my friend, I went crazy about relays and wanted to stop skating. His mother tried to convince me to continue to skate. I laughed and I will never be good enough to skate and she said that I got better than some of the people she knows. It made me feel better than before and then I started to skate. every day from there. When I think of that day, I still laugh. Skating can be fun in many ways. People can skate for fun and for compaction. There are different ways to skate. skate them and ride them differently. Some of the people who skateboard make me laugh because of the way they skate.
"Laughs" A good relationship is built on trust, right? This is what I have heard all my life, but as I grew older and really started to think for myself, I created my own kind of survival guide, if you want, for a good relationship for anyone. Of course, trust is important, but @ CAPS2 isn't the only key factor, I've learned that laughter is just as important not only to start a relationship, but also to keep @ CAPS2 alive. There was one person in my life who really helped me understand that and be able to have that relationship with them. My mom and I have such a great bond and way of understanding each other, other girls I know don't always have that with their mom, I'm very lucky. Sure, we have tough times like any family, but we are able to laugh @ CAPS2 over time and start over. @ CAPS5 helped me realize, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @ CAPS1 a good bond with my mom is so important to me, we haven't always performed so well. From about ten to thirteen, I was a little confused in the sense that I didn't want to show my emotions, I just wanted to stay calm. Then, seeing my mother as a strong and beautiful person, I have to admit that I was a little worried. @ CAPS5 would think I was a disappointment. I guess I was afraid to show him who I really was. Whenever @ CAPS5 joked with me I took @ CAPS2 very seriously and whenever we had a fight over little things I thought @ CAPS5 would hate me forever. I know now that I was stupid to think this, but I'm actually glad we went through this. I think that's part of what made us stronger, like the fact that there wouldn't be a rainbow without rain or that there wouldn't be a happy ending if all went well. well throughout your life. I didn't know the light at the end of the tunnel was just around the corner. One evening after dinner my mom informed me that @ CAPS2 was my night to do the dishes, unlike usual, I completely forgot and went to my room to listen to some music and finally me. fall asleep. My mother walked into my room upset and frustrated. @ CAPS5 said: "@ PERSON1, why did you ignore me? The dishes need to be done now." I jumped out of bed without a word and started walking towards the kitchen. @ CAPS5 followed me into the small bright room, "@ PERSON1? Are you ok, @ CAPS2 you're okay, you forgot. I'm not angry." @ CAPS5 exclaimed. Once again, not a word escaped my lips. I was afraid to say anything, the only sound coming out of me was a sigh of relief when I turned and noticed his absence. When I was done doing the dishes, @ CAPS5 pulled me into my room. I tried to read his face, @ CAPS5 looked worried. @ CAPS5 explained to me the relationship between her and her mother that @ CAPS5 desperately wanted to have with me. @ CAPS5 explained to me how they would @ CAPS3 together for stupid things and how they promised each other that when they fight they would stop, take a deep breath, then @ CAPS3. " @ CAPS3 ? What ? Why would you want to do this ? " I questioned. @ CAPS5 replied, "@ CAPS4's laughter is the best medicine for any sadness or bad day, as Grandma would always say." @ CAPS5 helped me go through this by tickling and joking. For the first time in my life, I was not nervous and said what I was thinking. As we sat there and fell asleep, I knew things would be different from now on, and they were. We have now made that promise to each other and now we can have wonderful, smiling memories together. Now, at fifteen, I can honestly say without a doubt that my mother will always be my best and most faithful friend. Our bond, how we come through tough times and how we can @ CAPS3 eliminate all stressful things in life makes me feel like I can get through anything. I really understood the meaning of the saying: “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
To laugh. A story about laughter, is that what you want to hear? Well my life is filled with laughs and smiles. Crazy I know! If it weren't for a laugh, I wouldn't have the six-pack I have today. Have you ever stopped to think about when one person can make another person laugh, they usually become very close friends, maybe even best friends? My boyfriend is my best friend. This time my boyfriend and I laughed so hard. My boyfriend is my life. I spend pretty much everyday with him, he's so amazing. Me and him well we do everything together. He is very close to me. He is the best best friend you could ask for! I've only known him for about a year, a lot can happen in a year. You can meet new people, build relationships, and even walk away from the relationships you just made. Me and @ PERSON1 are always laughing at each other and stuff too. We always have fun times with each other. It was late @ DATE1 @ TIME1 and he was driving me home like he always did before. There is this field with extremely tall grass and we were walking right next to it. Suddenly, out of nowhere, he acts as if he was being pulled into the grass. So guess what I did, I screamed as loud as I could scream ! Then he starts calling my name in a scary voice telling me to approach the grass. Out of curiosity about what just happened, I head for the tall grass. When I got to where he walked into the grass he said "@ CAPS1 I lost my shoe and can't find it anywhere!" @ PERSON1 and I start looking everywhere for his shoe. We couldn't see anything because it was very dark, so we used our hands to search for her shoe, "I found it!" I said. After finding the shoe, we realized that two hours had passed. We were so tired we lay down in the grass to grab and break and we both started laughing out loud at the ridiculousness of spending two hours on something that was meant to be a little joke! it was so awesome. When we finally got up, our stomachs hurt a lot and were very sore. I've never laughed so much in my life. Every time I'm with @ PERSON1 it's the best time of my life. We always seem to find a way to make each other laugh. Without best friends or even just friends, you'd probably be hard pressed to laugh. With friends, you always have someone to laugh with and to laugh with. This is why I treasure my best friend @ PERSON1 and all the happy and laughing times we have together because you will never know when is the last time you see this person. I try to be as happy as possible and always try to make people laugh because laughing is the best way to exercise.
Laughter is a big part of my relationship. I feel so much more connected with one person if we laugh together. Laughing makes you feel good. You may be in a state of depression and a friend or family member may approach you, soothe you, and make you laugh. If I had a relationship without laughing, I would leave this person as quickly as possible. Some people think that relationships are all about money and / or appearance. People today and days don't last that long in a relationship. In the old days, people would die together, and even in death, they would have graves right next to each other. My boyfriend's name is @ PERSON1. We've been dating for four years now. He's a very funny person, I love his jokes. Sometimes he doesn't even try to play a joke, but he does it anyway. When we first went out I was having a birthday party and I @ PERSON1 and a friend of his went to the woods and hid from everyone. When the others came to find us, we jumped up and scared them. They were mad at us, but when it got dark we all laughed about it together. My mom and dad don't really laugh together. They just go to @ ORGANIZATION1 together and come home together. My dad loves to joke every now and then, but my mom is the type of person who likes to laugh at other people who get hurt. My grandmother is so funny. She tries to make people laugh and hurt herself so she can have fun. All of my friends are funny. My best friend @ LOCATION1 is the funniest girl I have ever known. She likes to dance funny and make fun of people she doesn't like. When she's working she tries to find something to joke about, so she can bring it to me and almost make me pee in my pants. @ LOCATION1's relationship was very bad. She loves to laugh but her boyfriend hates to make jokes. She tried to hold on, but things just got worse and worse. The only thing he would do would be sit on his bed or couch and play video games or watch wrestling. He would make @ LOCATION1 clean his room and do the dishes. He has a one year old sister and he makes her watch, clean and feed her while he is in his room playing video games. @ LOCATION1 got so fed up, so she packed her things and left. She went to her sister's house. Now she has a fun boyfriend and they are still laughing together. There can be a relationship of laughter with animals as well as with humans. Animals are the only thing that can't answer you or make fun of you. Animals are like humans, but they cannot speak and they have fur. My cat is the king of my house. Its name is @ CAPS1. He loves to follow me around my house. I love to sit on the floor and watch him fight with all the other cats. Whenever I go into the kitchen, he's always there with me, looking for food. After eating, he receives an energy erg and runs around the house. It makes me laugh. He'll stop right in front of me and just stare at me, if I move he'll run away. Cats are cute but not all have the power to look into your soul like my cat. @ CAPS1 has big eyes and her meowing is so sweet and never ending. The funniest thing about him is how big he is. He's a big cat, but he's only one year old. So when I see him running around, it makes me laugh. My horse is the same. His name is @ CAPS2 and he is four years old. He's a crazy horse, but at the same time he's very funny. He tries to play with my other horses and gets injured because he bites them, so they push him away. He has a blue eye, so I bought him for my needs. Some people think horses are just a bill, but I think they are my family.
Everyone loves to laugh. Everywhere you look there is always laughter. Laughter comes from being happy, and being happy comes from having joy in your life. Several times in my life I have had joy. I tend to laugh several times a day because I am happy. One subject that makes me laugh is my niece. @ CAPS3 @ CAPS1 is two years old. She's the cutest little girl in the world. At least in my opinion, it is. Since she was so young, she has no worries or worries in the world. She knows everything is going to be taken care of. In this case, she is full of joy and happiness, which makes her laugh. When I'm with her, all that takes place is laughter and games. These are the greatest moments. @ CAPS3 has this cookie jar, and every time you put the shapes in the right places, it sings a silly little song. This song makes her laugh and dance uncontrollably. Which in turn makes me laugh. It soon ends up being a huge laughter party. These are the greatest moments. Recently we had another addition to the family. @ PERSON1, my nephew and @ CAPS2 brother. As @ PERSON1 gets older he keeps learning new things and @ CAPS3 loves it. She laughs louder than ever. She thinks it's the funniest thing when he laughs. These are the greatest moments. As we can see, laughter is happy and fun. Laughter begins with smiling, and smiling is also rooted in being happy. Lots of things make me laugh and smile. My niece and nephew are just one example. What makes you laugh and smile?
Why can laughter bring people together? Is it because laughter shows mutual trust, or is it just because you understand each other. There are many different types of laughter, like making a joke or someone doing something very embarrassing. The story I'm about to tell is about how such a bad day of hunting turned into the funniest moments ever. It all started in @ TIME1 when I woke up, and I forgot to put my wet clothes that were in the washer in the dryer. Now I had to go through all of my clothes in my room and find some camouflage clothes that weren't dirty or that I could wear. At that point, everyone would be in a bad mood and try to rush out. When my mate @ PERSON1 showed up and was ready to go and I wasn't. I was rushing, and when you rushing, you must have forgotten something, and I had left my gun at home. Five miles further on, I noticed I forgot my gun, so we turned around and went back to get it. Not only were we late now, but we were quickly going to the cabin for breakfast, @ PERSON1 had the eggs so we could make omelets. As we were going full speed down we hit a bump in the road and everything, I mean, it all hit the ceiling of the truck and then slammed to the ground. By doing this, all the eggs broke in the egg carton, so now we had no more eggs, and no eggs meant no breakfast. It's about thirty minutes before filming hours, and we're late for the blind so @ PERSON1 and I can meet our other friends, @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON2. Finally, we arrive blindly just before sunrise and as we prepare a group of twenty mallards arrived unexpectedly and took off before we could shoot. Now we all thought about our chance to redeem ourselves from a terrible @ TIME1. Only to find out that these ducks were the only ducks we saw all day. Around noon we gave up and went back up to the cabin, but on the way up we found ourselves stuck in two inches of water in a truck. I remember thinking to myself, "@ CAPS1 this isn't really happening to us right now." So @ PERSON3, @ PERSON2 and I got out of the truck to push, and @ PERSON1 stayed in the truck to drive. There were many attempts to pull the truck out, and finally on the sixth try we pushed the truck hard enough to pull it out of the muddy water. Now the fun part, when we released the truck, @ PERSON1 put the gas on, spinning the truck's tires and spraying mud all over the place. When I saw the amount of mud thrown all over the place, I jumped up behind @ PERSON2 and used it as a mud shield. At this point, @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON2 are @ CAPS2 in an inch thick layer of mud from head to toe. You couldn't help but laugh, it was the funniest thing ever. @ PERSON1 had watched everything through his rearview mirror and as soon as he was safe from jamming the truck again he fell off the truck because he was laughing so hard. Even @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON2 were laughing a bit too. So when it's a day where nothing is going your way or you are having bad luck you never know what the day has planned, in this case, this is one of the most memorable things to have. I remember that happened that duck season.
“@ CAPS1 find something to do ! I'm really bored ! ” @ CAPS2 explained as we all relaxed next to her dark blue @ CAPS3 which was graciously parked right next to my house. The @ ORGANIZATION1 was young and as young boys we needed something to do. The gears started spinning in my head! As I thought about a bulletproof plan, that would be very funny. "@ CAPS4 i l 'ai ! " I shouted. " @ CAPS1 here I'm really ready for anything @ CAPS21, "@ CAPS6 replied quickly. " @ CAPS7 since @ CAPS2 has a car he can drive into town and buy rap cheap saran, then @ CAPS15 go back to the four-lane intersection right next to my neighborhood and tie the rap around two of the trees on opposite sides of the street so the cars will speed by! " I explained quickly! as I ran out of breath Loud bursts of laughter came from all directions my friends were standing when I realized that this idea was golden. "I'll drive and pick it up, but does anyone have any money too!" @ CAPS2 jumped up as @ LOCATION2, @ CAPS6 and I handed him individual invoices. “ That's a lot ! Give me a few minutes, then we can meet at the intersection right next to the @ CAPS10 neighborhood. " @ CAPS2 said as he swept everyone of his car and began to get out of my neighborhood. "@ CAPS12 text me when you're about to come back!" I shouted at @ CAPS2 as the sound of its poorly maintained motor bellowed in the sky of @ TIME1. The minutes passed and the rest of us just sat on the sidewalk, talked and waited @ CAPS2. Ringtone My personalized ringtone for incoming texts sounds. My eyes quickly scanned the contents of the phone and concluded that @ CAPS2 was ready with the saran rap at the four-way intersection. "@ CAPS15 on @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 come on! @ CAPS2 is ready and so @ CAPS1 is doing this thing" I muttered as I grabbed my jacket and walked out of my neighborhood. @ CAPS6 trailed, while @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 came in the back. I shouted again to enhance the pass. @ CAPS2's car lights lit up @ ORGANIZATION1's air as he flashed a signal to tell us where he was. The four of us quickly ran to the driveway of a house for sale just outside my neighborhood where @ CAPS2 was parked. “@ CAPS17 you @ CAPS4 long enough,” @ CAPS2 explained. “ Well, we're all here ! So @ CAPS1 go to the intersection and set it up ! » @ PERSON1 explained that the start led too far towards the intersection which was about fifty meters away. When we reached the intersection there were no cars! We all got @ CAPS17 at this opportunity and @ NUM1 and @ PERSON1 watch out for cars! "I shouted as @ CAPS2 and started the process. Quickly I opened the saran rap and got ran across the road, unrolling the rap as we went. Soon as @ CAPS2 and I were both across the street, we both started hitting the saran firmly around the trees that we have already chosen. for the neighborhood on one side of the intersection. I was guessing this was where all my friends were hiding. "haha this is prefect ! I'm sure everything is fine ! "I explained as we all watched some delicately hung rap that ran both sides of the two-way street." @ CAPS21, we have to wait, "@ PERSON2 said as the anticipation was setting in. up and down as we checked to see if any cars were driving on the road. Since it was around @ NUM2 pm, most of the good people at @ LOCATION1 were sleeping or inside. But suddenly a car came out of @ CAPS21, accelerating and only @ NUM3 yards from the big prank. "@ CAPS22" I shouted as the car kept moving closer and closer. Boom ! The car rushed through the saran rap, then stopped screaming. Laughter broke out as the inspected target was completely in disarray. But the angry driver upon hearing our laughter decided to get out of his car and chase us ! "@ CAPS23 standing up "I shouted ! We all have @ CAPS23 just as the h omme reached the fence where we were hiding. Even if it was too late for @ CAPS6 ! The angry man grabbed him as the rest of us followed him to my house. As soon as we got to my place we all started to wonder what happened too @ CAPS6 ! Suddenly out of @ CAPS21 where @ CAPS6 came running up, as he @ CAPS22 joined us, we burst out laughing again ! The whole left side of @ CAPS6 was dripping with soda ! @ CAPS6 would never tell us what happened with @ ORGANIZATION1 although we might have guessed ! As the @ CAPS25 and along @ ORGANIZATION1 rapped, we all called to quit and threw the bag over at my house. But there was no lack of laughs at @ ORGANIZATION1 as we all fell asleep !
Interesting flight. It was the @ DATE1 of this @ DATE2, after a long @ DATE1 with some crying @ CAPS3 lots of goodbyes I was finally at the airport, waiting for my plane to @ LOCATION1. I have been to this airport so many times ... I love @ LOCATION2 but it is always exciting to go on vacation @ CAPS3 i @ CAPS1 with my parents quite frequently.Today it was different, it doesn't were not a vacation. It was going to be a whole year. @ CAPS3 my parents weren't going to be there Just think about being away from them @ CAPS3 all my friends at @ LOCATION2 for so long made my stomach ache. Mainly because in @ NUM1 I was going to meet my foster parents whom I had never seen before @ CAPS3 wondering if they were going to be normal people or a whole weird pair. Once on the plane I sat with a young girl who was in @ LOCATION2 studying architecture @ CAPS3 coming home for the winter..when I was just leaving. @ CAPS2 asked "@ CAPS1 you speak English "@ CAPS3 I said" I'm trying to "@ CAPS2 laugh, @ CAPS2 looked nice, with a big smile, @ CAPS2 was pretty too. We started talking @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2 smelled how anxious @ CAPS3 was. @ CAPS2 asked me if I was ok @ CAPS3 I told him I was going to be a foreign stage student for next year @ CAPS3 my worries about it like meeting some people or miss home. @ CAPS2 told me "you'll be fine, don't worry about that..l wish I had that chance when I was your age" @ CAPS3 so changed the subject. After a long conversation @ CAPS2 started reading a magazine @ CAPS3 I put my music on. When we were about to get @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS2 suddenly screaming so loud it made me jump we laughed for a long time @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2 couldn't even talk to me @ CAPS3 explained why @ CAPS2 screamed because everyone was looking at us @ CAPS3 which made him even funnier @ CAPS3 kind embarrassed too so @ CAPS2 couldn't stop laughing Then @ CAPS2 told me the guy in her magazine photo went with her to high school a few years ago @ CAPS3 they had been together for awhile but since graduation they haven't knew nothing of He was now working in a bank @ CAPS3 was making money, really money ... @ CAPS2 was going crazy talking to herself @ CAPS3 asking her why in the word @ CAPS2 stopped talking with him That good time with her, even though I haven't seen her again, it made me v really happy @ CAPS3 the moment we got off the plane I was more confident @ CAPS3 almost forgot all the nerves I was before. After @ NUM2 months here everything is fine @ CAPS3 I'm sure even if it was just a few laughs @ CAPS3 not very long ago on t Hat plane, when I come back @ LOCATION2 @ CAPS3 think of @ CAPS4 I will think of her , @ CAPS3 I will count this moment as my first good experience @ CAPS5.
In many relationships that I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and complacency. Although there was one person I had a relationship with that didn't involve laughing and it was rather boring and sad. I spent huge hours of my time just getting a chuckle or a chuckle from him. He was a pretty kind soul and could never hurt a fly, but still couldn't laugh even though he was happy. I would ask her over and over again "are you sure you are happy because you don't look like it? I never see you smile or laugh, all I see is a frown" he said. -I said with a bitter expression and he replied "yes, @ CAPS1 I'm happy but just because I'm not laughing doesn't mean I'm not and for that matter with that silly smile on your face , how could I not be happy? " with that answer, I just shrugged my shoulders and started over. " So why can't you laugh ? " And he replied sleepily because he was tired of the same subject every day. “ It's not that I can't laugh, it's that I choose not to ” and I said, “ Well, why the hell would you do that ? " He sighed and whispered, really boring subject. "Okay if you don't stop that" he said in a soft but strained voice, "I'm going to have to stop being so nice to you and I might not talk to you for the rest of the year" but of course he was only joking, he could never be nice to me and besides he was my best friend, he couldn't not talk to me. The subject was dropped and was never brought up again until @ DATE1 when I saw it. It was a cold @ DATE2 when I left my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big rental moving truck outside his house and I knew immediately that he hadn't lied to me but hadn't told me he was leaving. I started to think it was because of me always asking him why he wasn't laughing, but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went to his house not caring if I was late or never showed up to school this @ DATE2, I had to understand why he was leaving. Once we got to the porch of his house he was heading for the door and I blocked the doorway so he couldn't go any further making sure that if he wanted to bring the box of clothes to the truck, he should answer me. I asked him and he said, "My dad got a promotion at work and now we have to move to New York". I started to cry when he told me this, I was about eight and he was twelve. I knew I wasn't going to see him again, so I made sure that before I left school, we were dating before he left. That night in the park, he willingly told me without my asking him. “@ CAPS1, I know you've always wondered why I didn't luagh,” he said and continued “like i said its not that i can't laugh it’s is that I don't want to… I just… when I was young I was teased because of my smile ”. I didn't get it, why would someone tease him? so I asked "why? why would anyone tease you, you are nice" and he replied "because before my new teeth grew my old ones didn't look so good". And again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again "so why don't you smile now your teeth look good on me" he said "I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just didn't feel the need and now, well ... I could smile and tell the truth, I want it "I say" really !? " with too much excitement. "Yeah, and the only reason is you, you're the only person that makes me want to smile, it's because of that smile that you're always so happy. I just couldn't admit it because you're a girl and to me I guess having a girl makes me want to love myself and being my only friend younger than me makes me feel a little weak. " I didn't understand this back then, but now that I'm older I understand it and I'm so happy that I had that night to see her smile and many phone calls to hear her laugh. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and frankly it's absolutely true because after that night our friendship grew even stronger with just a phone call to an @ DATE2 and a little laugh.
These days you don't really need a reason to laugh. Laughter emanates from some people as frequently as a breath of air. I believe everyone has someone to laugh with because everyone has someone they love to be with. One of the people I love being with the most is my best friend @ PERSON1. Whatever the situation, whenever we're together we end up having fun. Laughter can completely change a bad day. One of my most recent examples of the power of laughter happened just a few weeks ago. One of my "friends" tried to play a cruel joke on me which ended up being a bigger mistake than she could have imagined. Once I realized that this person I trusted was trying to upset me, I became overwhelmed by my emotions. At one point I considered attacking this girl right in the middle of everyone at school. Fortunately, I used my best judgment to run away from her and hide instead of hurting her. Half the class period progressed and I was still very upset and unprepared for it. So there I stayed in safe hiding until my best friend found me. @ PERSON1 came to comfort me after hearing what had happened. She talked to me until I calm down and my tears stop. She made me feel so much better. Just being there for me and being able to recall the fun times we had together and the laughs we shared seemed to make all of my problems go away. Eventually she convinced me to go talk to my " friend " who, in fact, was ashamed of herself for her actions. We were able to reconcile and resume a somewhat normal life. To this day and more than likely for the rest of my life, I will believe that laughter is the best medicine. I guess I'm lucky I found the best person in life to share all of my laughs with. Every body must have someone.
Friends are not always what we want them to be, they are not always easy to find, but with a smile and a laugh, a friendship can become. I mean what a friendship if there aren't those times when you laugh until you pee. When you laugh until you can't breathe and you feel like you've done a hundred sit-ups. Of course you @ MONTH1 meet a friend like this and this @ MONTH1 happens when you least expect it. I did not expect a new friendship, but in a new city and with new people, I met the friend whom I now call the best friend. It was the year of @ NUM1 and I was new to @ ORGANIZATION1. In the main room everyone was looking at me like I was some kind of criminal and everyone was talking behind my back as I walked past their desks, at least that's how I felt. My main teacher @ PERSON2 @ CAPS1 me my so called schedule. Sixth period, course @ CAPS2 with @ PERSON1. What? @ CAPS2, what is it. I really had no idea what a @ CAPS2 was until I entered this course. I turned the rusty doorknob on the gym door where my class was supposed to be. I walked in and found out what a @ CAPS2 was. It was a one-wheeled bicycle. Wow! I laughed thinking how I didn't know. I looked around and saw that I was the only sixth grader. I sat down and looked around trying to figure out if I was really the only sixth grader there, when a girl came in who looked about my age. She sat down and I wondered if she was nice so I could go talk to her, but I was too embarrassed. @ PERSON1 asked everyone to pair up and I asked the girl if she wanted to be my partner. We started to use the unicycles and our partner had to help us get on and ride until we could ride unaided. Class was over and I told her my name was @ PERSON3 and she told me her name was @ CAPS3. I was super excited to go to class next time because I now had a "friend" well at least someone I talked to. I went to the class and she was away so I was a loner that time. I was to be partner with this other girl named the witch of the savannah was a totally girly girl. She didn't want to get on @ CAPS2, all she wanted was to talk. I was fed up with her at the end of the day and hadn't done my unicycle. I was really hoping @ CAPS3 would show up to class the next day, and she introduced herself. This time we had to meet up with our partner and do a routine on a song we wanted so we were pretty happy. We started practicing and trying to find something when suddenly we both fell. We looked at each other and started laughing and laughing, I couldn't breathe and she almost peed. It was one of the best times I had experienced that year, and I felt like me and her could become best friends. We are now very close friends and just this moment of laughing together brought us closer. We love to laugh, we think the more you laugh the younger you look and well I think it's true. each has their own story of how they met a certain person and how they became so close. I believe in every friendship, what brought her together was a smile or a laugh. A laughing moment where you laughed so hard you farted and milk came out of your friends' noses. It's a great time and you never forget it, it's something so simple yet so special and it really marks your heart and the way you feel with this person. It turned my friendship with someone I had met into a friendship that is now inseparable and incredible.
It was a normal, bright and warm day @ DATE1, entering my fifth year. My older sister and I had been playing all day with my other neighbors who were around our age. One of those neighbors was a boy. We couldn't find anything to do. It was too hot to walk in the sun so we decided it would be cool to play in the shade with the new slingshot my @ CAPS1 had made. He made it from an old swing seat and I thought my neighbor would really appreciate it. We all went to our garage to get it. My sister offered to take him down because it was taller and he hung up quite high, but I refused. It was my idea to show him so that I was the only one with him. As I was in full concentration, stretching out and reaching out to grab it, I noticed everyone around me giggling. My concentration weakened as I started to wonder what they were all laughing at. I stood there confused for a minute before I found out what had happened. My sister pulled my pants down ... in front of our little neighbor. I lifted my pants off the floor, looked my sister straight in the eye, and started beating her with my loose, fragile fists. I ran straight to my room, crying the whole way. My sister arrived moments later trying to bribe me under the covers with the last two roles of fruit. She sat on my bed waiting half an hour, I didn't move. She didn't say anything but I could feel her eyes piercing me through the sheets. Later that night, I finally got out. My sister kept apologizing but it didn't matter to me because I was mad at her, that's all that mattered. The whole of the next day passed and nothing had changed. She was still apologizing and I was still in the ignorant mood. My @ CAPS1 came up to me and said she was terribly sorry and upset too because I wasn't talking to her. I thought in my head, "how could she be upset .." but realized that I had not treated her well, even though I was not happy with her. After hearing what my @ CAPS1 said, I decided it wasn't worth it. I went to talk to my sister for the first time in days. She told me she didn't want to hurt me, she was just messing around. After talking about it for a while, I concluded that I was so upset because she did it in front of our friend. We joke like that all the time, but it's never in front of anyone other than family. I was worried it would scare our neighbor friend off, but he was back to play in a few days, so I didn't have to get upset. Even though I was embarrassed, I admitted that it was quite funny. We laughed about it and we were no longer enemies. I've learned that going back in time doesn't get you anywhere and you have to learn to laugh at things. Since then, whenever it is mentioned, we laugh so hard that tears run down our faces. I wouldn't have considered it a good thing when it happened, but I think it is now. This is another memory that my sister and I share and that we can remember. The more laughable memories you share, the closer it brings you to someone.
Making someone laugh is the best feeling for their soul, and it is one more step towards inner happiness. People might say that when they feel something good in their body, it is when they know they have done something right. I agree with this because it has happened to me; I was feeling depressed about something that I can't even remember, but when I felt the urge to help someone do something, I knew inside of me that I had done something. very special thing at that time. It's amazing how you make someone laugh, and no matter where you are you feel happy too. The only person in my life who has a great sense of humor is my mom. She always needs something fun. People love to laugh so much that it's if they were having some kind of energy drink so they wouldn't want to stop laughing. I hear people say that laughter is very healthy for a human soul, and it will also extend the life of the soul and body. Laughter is a way of expressing yourself without having to say a lot. It could be a great way to start a conversation with someone. Positive thinking leads to making good choices, especially if happiness is your guide in life. By making someone laugh, it makes the embarrassment go away. It is better to laugh than to be sad. Everyone has their addiction to something that they need to depend on. My mother's addiction makes people laugh. She laughs at work and especially at home when I'm around. Although, at times, she feels depressed whenever something goes wrong. I hate to see her like that, because it depresses me then. When she feels sad, it's if there's nothing in the world to cheer her up. If a person is feeling down, that feeling spreads to the next person closest to them. Eventually I end up seeing my mom like this and in this situation I can't help but get up and start doing silly things to cheer her up. Some things that come to my mind are that I can start dancing in a fun way or tell a little lie that might happen in school and that I think will cheer her up. When there is an opportunity to make someone laugh, I like to make them smile. My mother represents the world to me just as I represent the world to her. We try to help each other in any way we can. That day she came home from work and my dad was sitting at the table reading the newspaper and my mom walks in and notices that my dad hasn't cooked food yet, she started scaring her. She thought it was stupid of her not to cook us dinner. She was pretty angry with him for a while, so she started making dinner for us but she was doing it all wrong. She was mixing the spices in the wrong pot, I was going to let her know she was doing everything wrong, but my dad was holding me back so I wouldn't anger her more. She finally finished cooking and served us our plates but we didn't want to eat it because she made the food out of anger and made it feel funky. My dad forced us to eat it because he thought that eating food would make her happy, but he was wrong, it only made her feel worse because my younger brother didn't like it. I was feeling bad so I had to do something funny that was going to put her in the mood not to be mad at my dad anymore. I turned on the @ CAPS1 and changed the @ CAPS2 to music @ CAPS2 and started dancing like I had ants in my pants. Her lungs were about to explode because she was laughing so hard, and finally she was in a good mood for the rest of the day. are said. I think it's a good thing for someone to feel good about themselves because it brings a positive feeling to the room. I like to see people being happy because that always makes me happy. What better way to be happy than a smile is one step closer to laughing. My mom and I love to take walks just so we don't feel separated and stay closer to each other, we see different people every time we go for a walk and we always have a smile from them. It's the best feeling in the world, to feel joy is to be free from all your problems.
"Laughter is the key to the soul." @ CAPS1, you are having the worst day of your life, or the best day of your life, laughing can always make it better. I was sitting in the @ CAPS2 class one day and was losing my mind so bored. Then, a shy and calm kid, all of a sudden started to laugh! @ CAPS3 couldn't stop ! It was like @ CAPS3 was on "laughing gas". @ CAPS3 laughed so hard @ CAPS3 couldn't breathe anymore. Now that made me laugh, then my best friend sitting next to me laughed. Soon the whole class was laughing! So while some of the @ CAPS2 class might have been bored or having a bad day, the laughs spread throughout the room making it a better day. Laughter spreads like wildfire and makes everyone happier. And when you're happier, you're healthier. So with that, a @ CAPS2 relationship has to have some laughs to work. When you ask someone what they like about their boyfriend or girlfriend, if it's a @ CAPS2 relationship, they will almost always say, "@ CAPS3 / she makes me laugh" . @ CAPS5 when you don't have a laugh in a relationship you end up in more fights, more disagreements, and more disappointment. The more you laugh, the more you can live a better life and enjoy life more. Did you laugh today?
There are a lot of joys in life, some are more relevant than others, and some are so obvious that you would be foolish not to notice them. Have you ever sat on your porch or looked out the window just to watch the sun come up, as you sit there meditating on your life and its unusual qualities, you think of all the good memories, all the laughs? that you've shared, all the sorrows, all the pain, and all the love and hate. It's no surprise that almost everyone has done just that and they wonder if they could turn things around, how would they do that, or leave things as they started, fill their life is complete and they are complete too, not having without regret. For all the tears that I have cried and all the pain that I have been through, there has always been a laugh to top off the sadness. some time I sit and flatter myself with my life, although I haven't lived long and my real experiences are yet to come, I have been through a lot of my short experiences, but I don't mind because I took in what happened during my period and learned a lot from it. I have learned that no matter how hard you try you can never fully tell that your life will always be something or someone unexpected, all you can do is hope for the best and prepare yourself. at worst. It's not hard to be happy, just keep an open mind and a light heart, and soon you will find yourself laughing with the rest of the world and enjoying your short stay on this amazing planet we call @ LOCATION1 , so listen to your mom and dad or even the person you most admire in life. There are a lot of things that keep me going, like my boyfriend or my love for animals, but the most important thing that I can think of is not just one thing, it's a collection of things, like love, laughter, new beginnings and old endings, a bright and new path (all you have to do is take it), the relentlessness of the universe and the idea that there is @ MONTH1 other planets that support life, possibly even intelligent life. It's easy to find things to live for and even easier to find things to die for, I hope you are looking for things to live for. I remember when it was difficult and I thought I would never be happy and felt that I was not made for this world and its many confusing aspects. I was at the end of my way or at least pretended to be, but something happened as I sat on the side of an old road. I looked up at the stars and thought about what I would miss if I finished my path now, how dare I name my child or children for that matter if I even had the chance to produce any. to marry, will our love last or will it fade away like the morning due. So I finally decided that there was too much that I wouldn't feel if I ended it so soon. after that fateful evening i started my life slowly as a better person who wanted a bright future with a romantic but searing love story to tell my child (ren), and with devotion, trust and respect would hopefully last . but that's not all I want my adventure to be. I would like to find peace of mind in a place where silence is a rarity, I want to help bring out the possibility of sharing the world with animals without repelling them or abusing their natural right to be on this @ LOCATION1 in on our side, I want to solve the problem of pollution that we humans have more than to produce. I guess I will do it on my small scale because in one person and every little thing in this very big house of ours, but no matter how small I am, what I do or say will have an impact. so if I want something to look back on and laugh about, I have improved what I consider my part and make this planet a shared and healthy planet.
A true story of how two close friends became friends over the joy of laughing. One year old boy named @ PERSON1 who wanted to do something fun this @ DATE1 by asking him to stay in his room and play video games all day. So he heard about a play called "@ CAPS1 In @ LOCATION1" from a friend and found out if he could join the play and help him out, but he ended up participating in the play and helped out. take the stage whenever he could. @ PERSON1 found that he enjoyed performing the play very much and made a lot of friends. At one time when @ PERSON1 was having fun, there was a girl named @ ORGANIZATION1 who didn't talk to @ PERSON1 much, but she liked him and she didn't tell many people. @ ORGANIZATION1 also tried to make as many friends as she could at plays and spent as much time as possible with her friends. As the play was starting to end @ PERSON1 started dating @ PERSON2 who is the older brother of @ ORGANIZATION1 and started paying her a little more attention and found out through her brother that she loved @ PERSON1 , but @ PERSON1 already knew she liked him the way she acted with @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 joined another room called "@ CAPS2 to @ LOCATION1" after playing "@ CAPS1 to @ LOCATION1" due to his enjoyment of making the first room. @ PERSON1 discovered that he already knew most of the people who were making the first play. So he started talking to the rest of their own that @ PERSON1 didn't already know. This is when @ PERSON1 and @ ORGANIZATION1 started talking to each other and they both found out that they were having fun laughing and became close friends. they became such close friends vary quickly due to how @ PERSON1 likes to make friends varies easily and @ ORGANIZATION1 doesn't have many friends or close friends or it could have been the fact that @ ORGANIZATION1 loved her so much. @ ORGANIZATION1 didn't have many friends because the kids at school made fun of her for being so smart, then she would go back to school at home and lose some of her only friends that she she had. @ PERSON1 soon discovered in their friendship that @ ORGANIZATION1 was afraid that @ PERSON1 would not want to be her friend because of all the friends she had already lost. By the time the play was starting to end @ PERSON1 had already noticed that @ ORGANIZATION1 had liked @ PERSON1 before they were friends and he asked her if she liked him, she first said no but then she felt bad for telling him the truth about how she loved him and how she thought it would be better if they just stayed friends. The two of them knew that they could only be friends because of their age difference. @ PERSON1 was @ NUM1 and @ ORGANIZATION1 was @ NUM2. So they both knew it would never have worked because of their age. So they both agreed that it would be better if they just remained friends. By the end of the play, every minute was used to develop their friendship. By the end of the play, they both became close friends and enjoyed the good times they had together and also enjoyed each other's laughter. Even after the play, they both spoke when they had time to talk to each other, but they didn't see each other much. When they had time to talk, they talked about the good times they had together and how much fun they had. They also talked about how great and how fun they were to perform the pieces. The two agreed that they would be doing the parts again the next @ DATE1 and were looking forward to seeing each other the next @ DATE1 and how many good things they will have to talk about. End in the end, I think @ PERSON1 and @ ORGANIZATION1 are going to be friends for a long time. maybe as they get older they could be more than friends and see their friendship leveled up ......... only time will tell.
I never thought that laughing could help you strike up a conversation with someone you don't even know. But @ CAPS4 can. Just laughing with someone can make you meet a new person. One of the first things I do @ CAPS6, someone tries to be funny, is laugh. Once you know @ CAPS2 that the other person is talking about, you forget that you are getting to know that person. It has happened to me once. @ CAPS4 happened at @ LOCATION1, where my family and I usually go to @ DATE1 each year. I made a great friend and the first thing we did was laugh. As you know @ LOCATION1 is a warm place and the sun is usually present every day. I spend the days we stay there to go out walking with my sister and my cousins or go to the beach with my family. I remember @ CAPS4 was on a day when my cousins, sister and I went to a little store which is just down the street where we are staying. We wanted to buy some candy and other things to bring with us @ CAPS6, we went home. I did not expect to see one of my cousins there with his friends. @ CAPS6 I saw them, the only thing they did was laugh at something. I couldn't hear them but once we got closer I heard a hilarious thing they said. I couldn't help but hear so I started to laugh. A friend of his saw me laughing and he thought I was laughing at him. He asked me if I was making fun of him and of course I said no. I told him that I accidentally overheard his conversation so he started to laugh. “It was funny, it wasn't @ CAPS4,” he laughed to me. "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 was. I didn't know you were making jokes like that," I replied. He kept talking to me and then he said, "I always talk like that so don't be afraid. I'm not saying @ CAPS4 to hurt anyone." I thought @ CAPS4 was nice for him to clarify this, but I already knew the folks at @ LOCATION1 who talk like this. We kept talking @ CAPS6 I started laughing again. "@ CAPS2 did I say now ?" He asked. "@ CAPS3. I just remembered @ CAPS2 you said at the start. It was really funny," I replied. For some reason I couldn't forget @ CAPS2 he said and I don't think I will ever forget him. I think @ CAPS4 was probably due to the way we met really surprised me. I had never met a person, especially a guy, laughing at first. Guess I thought @ CAPS4 was a great way to start a conversation. Laughing with the person will let them know that we care about them and understand them. It's at least @ CAPS2 I thought. I had a good conversation with my new friend. We talked about how I was taking my vacation. I told him that every year I go there and I always enjoy them. My family and I spend a good time with my grandparents and cousins of @ LOCATION1. I told her that I sometimes say that I would rather live at @ LOCATION1 than where I live because @ CAPS4 is so much quieter there. He agreed with me on a part of @ CAPS2 that I told him because he knows that @ CAPS2 @ CAPS4 likes living at @ LOCATION1, but he doesn't know how I like living in another place. After he told me, he was silent for a few seconds. I noticed something instantly. I had noticed that our conversation was not like at the beginning. At first we couldn't stop laughing and had some interesting things to say. Then @ CAPS4 got quieter and a bit unusual. I did not just stop the conversation there, so I asked him where he was going because @ CAPS6 I started talking to him, he was with one of my cousins and I was with my other cousins . Now we have started laughing again. This time @ CAPS4 was because we had just noticed that the people we were with had left us. "@ CAPS6 are they gone ?" he asked me. "I don't know, but they can't be that far because we haven't talked for a long time," I told him. We walked together to get them and I was right. They weren't that far. They were always looking for things to buy and I don't think they noticed we were missing. We got together with them and acted like @ CAPS3 had happened. @ CAPS4 was strange to me because every time I looked at it I remembered our conversation. The first thing that came to my mind was that we started our conversation laughing at a funny thing he said. I actually loved making a new friend this way. Now every time I go to @ LOCATION1 I know I have a new friend there and if I decide to do so I can make other friends just by laughing with them in their conversations.
As I waited in the car, eager to meet my best friend and the man I was in love with, I started to laugh. Not because something my mom or brother said was funny, or because I saw something funny, but I was nervous. I had spoken to him countless times on the phone, numerous text messages, and countless emails. But I was still nervous. I knew him better than most, but my anxiety seemed to make me lose my mind. As our black rental sedan pulled up where he was waiting outside where his family lived, I got more nervous. @ CAPS6 if he wasn't really like I thought he was? @ CAPS6 if he didn't love me? @ CAPS6 if I didn't like it? As soon as he got into the car, smiling brightly at me, my nervous laughter and anxiety dissipated. I smiled back. “@ CAPS1, @ PERSON1,” he said. "@ CAPS1 @ PERSON2", I say, butterflies in my stomach. I was still smiling broadly, he reached out and took my hand cautiously. "@ CAPS3 was the reader ?" he asked, squeezing my hand lightly. “@ CAPS4, and scary,” I replied, a nervous laugh seething again. “@ CAPS5 you are here now, and I am very happy that @ CAPS7 is,” he said with a smile. And for the rest of the drive to the restaurant, our conversation went so well I thought I was dreaming. Here he and I were two guys in love with each other, new to both of us, and we were as happy as we could get. During the whole drive we held hands and talked, I felt like I had known him all my life. Not just for a year and a half that I had known him. We got to @ ORGANIZATION1 too fast and we all got out of the car, I was hungry and so was he. But we had to wait for a table for half an hour before we sat down. Once at the table, my mother, who was very happy that I found someone I loved so much and knew our love, began to regale us with tales from my childhood. It was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life. I was bright red most of the time she told these stories. Some I remembered, some didn't. @ PERSON2 laughed and joked with me about each of them. Which made my nervous laughter turn into a real laugh. It also helped that he held my hand under the table. After having dinner and having dessert, we went to the nearby mall to do some shopping and just hang out. My mom and brother went one way, and @ PERSON2 and I went another. We bought some clothes together and ended up in a bookstore. My favorite bookstore, @ ORGANIZATION3. Back in my favorite section, Young Adult Fiction, I noticed @ PERSON2 staring at me. "@ CAPS6 ?" I asked stupidly. He smiles slyly. "@ CAPS7 just looks very ... in your element," he smiles. "@ CAPS8 ?" I say, in false confusion. He just smiled and took my hand back in his. "@ CAPS9 problem," he said, shaking my hand. He pulled me closer to him, we were the only ones in that part of the store. "@ CAPS10 if I'm a little ahead ?" He asked. I shook my head @ CAPS9. He leaned down and kissed me very softly on the lips, I blushed a bright red and started laughing after our lips parted. He raised an eyebrow, I knew he was thinking of @ CAPS6 just by the look on his face. “It was fantastic,” I said, putting my fingers to my lips. I had a silly smile on my face. "@ CAPS11," he said simply, kissing me again. “I love your laughter, my love,” he told me, I was in seventh heaven, I was really in love with someone and I felt good! I had never been so happy before. Except maybe the first time I went to @ ORGANIZATION2. But it was definitely better, because it could last a lot longer. What he has, since we've been together ever since. Our two eyes fixed our future together. Now every time I remember I started to laugh happily to myself. Yes, I get a stare every now and then, but I don't care. Laughter is the thing that helped bridge the gap between him and me. Which makes us the closest we've ever been.
Fourth period, the first year was the highlight of my entire first year. @ LOCATION1 was what most people called it, but I just called it @ CAPS1. So I will start with the first semester of ninth grade with the physical sciences, fourth period. I had the first trimester with my best friend, @ PERSON1, @ CAPS12, we got to choose our seats so we sat next to each other in the back right corner of the classroom. We sat there so we could do more, like passing notes @ CAPS12 while talking during class. So one day, while we were passing the notebook, I mostly wrote something that embarrassed her. So I went to get something in my backpack, @ CAPS12 she took advantage of the situation. So the next thing I knew, I was pushed out of my desk, on my backpack, on my back. The class fell silent because he was giving us @ CAPS12 notes showing us how to do homework. As we burst out laughing I looked at him to see if he was very angry @ CAPS12 if he was going to send us out of the classroom to talk to us. But all @ CAPS1 has done is look at us, shake his head, laugh a little to himself, @ CAPS12 starts talking again. So we kept laughing but we were trying to calm down @ CAPS12 we stop laughing. In the second trimester, @ PERSON1 was @ CAPS10 with me, but I had my friend @ CAPS3- @ CAPS4, @ CAPS5. @ CAPS5, @ CAPS12 @ PERSON2. I was even closer to @ CAPS1 than in Q1. So one day he was teaching us the compounds. As he wrote a chart to help us study, he sang, "@ CAPS7 play @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 !" @ CAPS10 Even seconds later the class burst out laughing, even though he had to stop writing that he was laughing so hard. It took us about ten minutes to get settled in @ CAPS12 stop laughing. Another part of Q2 that was fun @ CAPS12, a good laugh was doing a few sample problems ourselves. So a classmate of mine, @ LOCATION2, asked what we should do to tell him we're done with the problems. So @ LOCATION1 thought for a few moments, @ CAPS12 said, "@ CAPS11 you're done with your problems, giggle like a chicken for me." @ CAPS12 about five minutes later, people started giggling like chickens. @ CAPS12 with that my friends mentioned that I own chickens. But as more and more people finished their problems, it got boring. It was still hilarious at first. Then there was @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14. We only had a regular classroom, @ CAPS10 a science @ CAPS13, so we didn't get to do many experiments. So @ CAPS15, the other science teacher let us borrow her classroom for an entire school @ CAPS14, since her class had an online report to do. @ CAPS1 forbade me to use matches because his nickname for me was @ CAPS16- @ CAPS17. Then on the last day he broke about @ NUM1 to a dozen glass test tubes. @ CAPS11 this happened, I was almost complete with my package that we needed to do for @ CAPS14. So I went over to him while he was cleaning up, @ CAPS12 I asked what had happened. He told me, my classmate broke a bunch of glass test tubes by dropping them. But he looked at me @ CAPS11, he did. So @ CAPS11 I looked at him he started to laugh. Which betrayed his cover so I got after him @ CAPS12 told him @ CAPS10 to blame the kids for what he did. especially for breaking test tubes. There was also the one time I went to his class @ CAPS18 to do some homework. My friend wanted me to be there for a day because she loved the class so much. So my guitar teacher allowed me to spend the fifth period in this class. So @ CAPS11 he had finished giving @ CAPS12 grades giving the class their homework for the day. Friends of @ CAPS3 @ CAPS19 called him with a question. So I looked up at my drawing. By then he had already passed to them. So they asked him if he was a swimmer, he replied that he was swimming. So they asked him if he had shaved his legs because he was a swimmer. I think he was embarrassed so he said to come after class @ CAPS12 and ask some personal questions. So they just wanted a yes or a no so he explained, for about five minutes, that they shouldn't waste time in class on a silly personal question @ CAPS12 about him. I thought the whole time, "Doesn't @ CAPS20 just say yes or no ?" @ CAPS21 were fun times that I will never forget @ CAPS12 recounts the day I died. No science course or course will ever replace the fourth period physical sciences. Neither teacher replaces @ LOCATION1, he is @ CAPS12 will always be my favorite teacher. I will always remember the time of every physics class, because of this simple teacher.
Sometimes I wonder why people are laughing. People laugh when something is funny or when things @ CAPS3 are awkward and they don't know what else to do. Often times people laugh when they @ CAPS3 are embarrassed or offended. In fact, I find myself laughing for no reason on occasion. if I can make someone laugh, I usually feel very accomplished. I think it personally shows the emotions out loud. But, in some cases, you laugh at yourself uncontrollably. Every year since I moved here six and @ DATE1, my two cousins and my sisters and I went to "sing cheese balls" with our grandparents to @ CAPS1. Even after my grandfather died at @ DATE4 and my older sister left for college. On the 21st of @ DATE2, we are secretly going @ LOCATION1 to go shopping one by one with one of our grandparents while we prepare the cheese balls by hand. After all five of us are gone, we wrap the cheese balls and put a ribbon on them as we practice our Christmas carols for that evening. We always make a list before we start Christmas carols. The first thing on the list is who we @ CAPS3 are going to be going to that night. The second next to each family's name is the number of cheese balls we will be delivering to that specific house. Third, what song we @ CAPS3 are going to sing to them. Usually there are about twenty-five to thirty people on the list. All @ CAPS3 family members and very close friends or people from their work. We always have a great time with him too. No fights or quarrels or anything like that. It's really nice to just be with the family and catch up. Usually it's been about a year since we've all been together at the same time. Last year was the first year we went to sing with my older sister. She went to college on @ DATE3 before, leaving me the oldest grandchild there. At first it didn't seem any different, but as the day wore on I could feel it take off. With his departure and my grandfather who was no longer there, the pressure increased uncontrollably. I started to relax a bit when we started and just tried to have fun. My grandmother shouted at me to grab the list and add a name. At first, I didn't think about it at all. Later she told us that we had to make up a special song for the family. And that's where it hit me. The name sounded familiar to me because I used to go to school with a boy of the same last name. It was then that I asked him to check if it was the same family. Indeed, it was. I had a crush on this boy since I remembered. We lost contact after I found out he loved my cousin. I knew it was going to be extremely embarrassing to have to sing in front of him, not to say embarrassing. I remember thinking "@ CAPS2 awesome, that's exactly what I needed. It's gonna be awesome." We did our rounds and everything went very well. We had a lot of fun, made jokes and laughed about everything. Then came the time to go to "his" house. We all choked. The girls had heard a lot about how cute and dreamy this boy was, so they were all nervous too. We were sitting there in the truck telling each other that he wouldn't be home, and even if he was, everything would be fine and everything would be fine. I think it was the longest walk to a house with such a short path ever. My grandmother rang the doorbell and we positioned ourselves to be ready to sing when the door opened. To our dismay, he answered it. We froze! We were like gargoyles staring at him speechless. He gave us a weird look and said "@ CAPS3 are you going to sing or just stay there?" with a devilish little smile. I tried to sing, but nothing came out. That's when the younger cousin starts singing happy birthday. It wasn't the song we had planned for this house, and it wasn't her birthday. In the middle of the second "happy birthday to you" we all start to laugh out loud, and I'm not talking about a laugh or a chuckle. We @ CAPS3 are all laughing so hysterically that we can't breathe, and he closed the door. I know if we had stayed there it would have made this memory much more terrible, but because we were all laughing, we can look back and laugh at ourselves for it. Laughing is a good way to release the inner emotional pressure I realized that night. It is a memory that I am sure we will never forget. I've done something like this a few times, but it was number one on my list of "what were you thinking" moments. I wouldn't change a thing.
Laughter is always the key to complete happiness, all you really have to do is laugh to be happy. I remember the class @ NUM1, I was the new student and I can tell you well I didn't know where something really was, it was a new school: a new bus, brand new. Being the new student is something that nobody wants to be, you get a lot of fun and sometimes you just don't like it. Well that's my story, I don't fit in. One day I was walking down the stairs in my class, and was a beautiful sunny day, I do not think there was really clouds that day. Anyway, as I was going up the stairs I tripped and fell back and my skirt that I was wearing pulled up over my head, and of course at that time you had to have character underwear. Well I remember everyone was pointing at me and laughing at me A. because I had just fallen, and @ CAPS1. because i was wearing dora underwear. Therefore, I spent the whole day with everyone laughing at me, but to tell you the truth, I laughed with them. Honestly, I thought it was funny enough to fall down and show your underwear? who doesn't think it's funny? After the fact, this girl named @ CAPS2 came up to me and told me that I was not the only one wearing character underwear. stairs! Then being the new kid on the block which might actually be embarrassing, but for me, I've done it a million times, so it didn't really bother me as much as people thought. @ CAPS2 and I became such good friends that we laughed the whole time. Like when we went to the park and she fell in icy water, or when I fell down the stairs. To this day, we're still talking about it, it's just something that we really don't get over. Not to mention that it was pretty funny when my character underpants appeared. In conclusion, I think that when the quote says "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" is really true, you have to have a good laugh before you can get on with your day, that is just a known fact. If you don't laugh all day long, there's something really wrong with you. Just because you're getting older doesn't mean you have to let go of your laughter. Laughter is the part of the day when you can do whatever you want. So you tell me what's your funny story?
@ ORGANIZATION1 blew me away the first time I saw her. She was my other half. Everything we did together was perfect. She made me laugh with everything she said. She was my better half would sum it all up. I still remember when I first saw her in @ CAPS1. The town's nickname was @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 hell because of where it was, in the middle of nowhere. We met when I was on vacation at @ CAPS1. My parents had just retired a few months ago and were looking for a comfortable retirement home away from the big city and closer to @ CAPS4 the good eastern mountains @ LOCATION2 which seem @ CAPS4 still have snow capped peaks and beautiful scenery. We ended up staying there for about a week in this small trailer that we took with us. This thing was hell on earth, every time we stopped @ CAPS4 would have configured everything even if we weren't going to @ CAPS4 using it. It was a two hour process and after the hundredth time you can see how bored I would be. looking for a big house @ CAPS4 staying in this city has not been difficult @ CAPS4 coming. They were all amazing homemade homes. Never has a paid contractor @ CAPS4 built these houses because the men in town made them by hand. They were amazing two story oak houses that looked like they could withstand a tornado with only scratches. We ended up finding this house so amazing that I wanted @ CAPS4 to live there from the start, surprisingly my parents wanted it @ CAPS4. But the sad part is that @ CAPS4 either sold our house first or @ CAPS4 couldn't afford it, so we put this house on the "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6" and went back @ CAPS4 trailer. We still had @ NUM1 days or so there and I was officially bored. I needed something @ CAPS4 to do besides storing the fire and making sure the hot dogs weren't burning. I hopped on my dad's bike and went into town (the trailer park was about half a mile from town). I arrived in town @ CAPS4 to be very disappointing. It was just as boring to cycle around town and stop inside the @ CAPS4 store for a chat as it was sitting by the fire in @ NUM2 degree weather. In my mind it was just another boring vacation, but I had no idea it was @ CAPS4 for a lot more fun. I woke up the next day, took a shower, and got ready for the day. It seemed like another boring day in hell from what I could tell. @ CAPS4 had fun doing things I wouldn't normally do. But back then @ CAPS1 and places like this just didn't cut it because all I did to get @ DATE1 was to go to @ CAPS4 places like this and to do nothing, so I was expected to @ CAPS4 to be bored. I cycled around the corner and saw a bunch of guys and girls that seemed to be coming from fishing, tubing, or something fun so I rode @ CAPS4 to see what was happening. I started talking about @ CAPS4 to a guy named @ CAPS8. He told me that they had just returned from a group of young people gathered on the snake where they were tubing and cliff jumping. I was in aw. Seemed crazy to me @ CAPS4 me. Cliff jump? Tubes? Seemed good @ CAPS4 crazy for a group of young people. But I guess that's how they do things in @ CAPS1. They just don't go picnicking, they do crazy stuff that I personally haven't done things they were talking about because for one I'm not crazy and for two I've never had the chance. We kept talking and before they all left they invited me @ CAPS4 to take a nature hike to the top of this mountain. I was more than happy @ CAPS4 oblige because I love hiking. I woke up in @ TIME1 feeling all excited and ready @ CAPS4 rock. I had my authorization slip signed and I was ready for a good hike. I hopped on my dad's bike and drove into town at five o'clock from @ TIME1 and got to the youth administrator's house just in time for a protein shake for breakfast (he's got it). offered @ CAPS4, I didn't ask). We drove @ CAPS4 up the mountain and at the base there were about @ NUM3 @ CAPS4 @ NUM4 people all in hiking gear. It surprised me because I didn't expect so many people. It was then that I met @ LOCATION1. She was gorgeous so I was immediately drawn to @ CAPS4. We started the climb and I started talking to @ CAPS4 with @ CAPS4. We were like two pees in a pod. I couldn't get enough of her and her of me. His laughter made me extremely happy. She was my other half. All I remember is his incredible laugh.
` The story of @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 is about how I fell into the dog @ CAPS1 and entered it, I fell from a slippery trampoline. About four or five years ago I went to a friend's house to stay at @ TIME1. That day was a hot day, so my friend and I made a plan to have fun and keep cool, so my friend and I went to the garage and found the sprinkler, so we decided to put the sprinkler on. sprinkler under the trampoline and when you do it makes the trampoline wet and slippery. My friend and I started jumping on the trampoline and he started jumping too much higher than me and I started to lose bounce and he came back down the same time as me but he had more bounce which made my bounce. 'bounced a lot higher than usual could he also weigh more than me. So I came back down and landed on my back and the angle I was on the trampoline pulled me over. As I bounced off the trampoline I thought I was going to injure myself and had rather had a few scratches than landed on dog manure, but that's exactly what happened, I landed on a pile of dog manure and it really stank my shirt so bad but after I took my shirt off I started jumping again and jumping all day but I don't regret it because afterwards that everyone had a good laugh, including me. so the @ CAPS3 story was part of the laughter and how laughing is a great way to have fun and even when @ MOIS1 was a bad thing that happened to you maybe in the end it was funny even though at the time that was not the case.
@ CAPS9 have you ever been so scared that you couldn't sleep through the night? Were you with a group of friends @ NUM1 at the time ? Telling scary stories can be fun and entertaining until someone gets too scared and freaks everyone out. At first, everyone is watching movies and having fun until the parents go up the stairs and it's time to party. It was called our party "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2", we call it "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2" because, we children @ CAPS5, we think of ourselves as @ CAPS1. Our night involves @ NUM2 antsy @ LOCATION1, @ NUM1 scared teens and a house that said to be "@ CAPS6". To begin this incredible night of terror, guests had to arrive first. Everyone arrived at my house around @ NUM4 pm. We started by playing video games, laughing, having fun, eating, playing board games. Just your average teenage party. That was until the parents went upstairs to bed. Once installed in bed and sound asleep, we released the games "@ CAPS7 or @ CAPS8". I bet you thought we were gonna be immature seedlings and play the unrated version, right? Well luckily we are the kids of @ CAPS5. Just your normal “I @ CAPS8 you run around the house three times” or “@ CAPS9 have you ever kissed someone?”. Nothing unrated about it. After a while everyone got bored of playing this redundant game, so we moved on to the next activity we were going to do, which was play Sing-Star on @ NUM5, but @ LOCATION3 brought the wrong cords so we couldn't plug in the console. As it didn't go as planned, we started chatting and taking pictures of @ CAPS1. Since this was our "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2", it was absolutely necessary to take some pictures of all of us together as @ CAPS1. For our role @ CAPS1, it goes like this, I am the father, @ PERSON3 is the mother, @ LOCATION3 is the cat, @ PERSON8 is the @ CAPS12, @ PERSON9, @ PERSON5, @ CAPS13 and @ PERSON6 were my children , @ PERSON1 is my brother, @ PERSON7 is the awful strange woman, @ PERSON4 is the sister-in-law and @ LOCATION2 is our cable operator. This is how we all saw ourselves in @ CAPS1, so we all had to wear costumes that matched our personality traits for the photos. It took a while for everyone to focus and stop bickering, but we were able to cooperate and proceed with the photoshoot. After the photos, it was time to satisfy our appetites. I ordered a pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed. We got @ NUM6 different great pizzas. Hawaiian, @ CAPS14 @ CAPS15, @ CAPS16 @ CAPS17, @ CAPS18, @ CAPS19 @ PERSON2 and @ CAPS20. One by one we all kept coming back for more. My "daughter" (@ CAPS13) dropped her pizza on the carpet and left a huge red stain. We all started to work. @ PERSON9 got the cleaner, I got the rags, @ PERSON4 got the @ CAPS22 and @ PERSON7 got the camera. She thought it would be humorous to take pictures while we were cleaning up for our life. Once the mess was cleaned up, we stopped eating and put everything else away. It was now movie time @ CAPS23. Snuggling up on the couch with @ NUM1 people all huddled together is the "right" way to watch a @ CAPS23 movie. The movie we chose was called The @ CAPS24. Everyone sitting on top of each one was fun until someone had to use the bathroom. Then that's when it all happened ... when @ PERSON4 got up to go to the bathroom, the @ CAPS25 went out, all the lights in the house went out and we continued to notice shadows crossing the walls in our living room. @ CAPS13 started crying, @ LOCATION2 was complaining, @ PERSON4 was not using the bathroom and I was panicking. As none of the lights came back on, we all circled around the mat and started telling some legitimately scary stories. Most of them were really honest, and the rest were considered myths. @ PERSON6 told a story about a possessed @ CAPS26 who did not have a left leg and terrorized pedestrians. Well I happened to have a @ LOCATION1 that didn't have a left leg and when we started telling this story my @ LOCATION1 started to panic and attack all of my guests. So I grabbed my dog's whistle and ordered them to stop and fire. After all the fuss my parents never woke up and we all rushed to my room to continue our discussion of @ CAPS23 stories. During the whole process of @ CAPS2 the main lesson was that you can conquer any type of fear as long as you @ CAPS9 have a sense of laughter and friends to support you and that is what happened at party. We were just hysterical about the whole situation and no one ever left anyone alone and always comforted them by laughing. By far I would tell @ CAPS9 this was my favorite and funniest night I have ever had with @ CAPS9.
Laughter and exuberance are key parts of any good relationship. Being able to be giddy and happy with someone close to @ CAPS11 is a sign of comfort. It can often bring people together and help solidify their friendships. Your real self is shown in your humor. Two years ago, when I was in the seventh grade math class from @ PERSON1 to @ ORGANIZATION1, I was selected to be part of @ ORGANIZATION2 with only three other classmates. Being in @ ORGANIZATION2 just meant that we would be teaching each other @ CAPS1- @ CAPS2 using only textbooks, while @ PERSON1 would teach the rest of the class easier and simpler math. The @ ORGANIZATION2 was almost like an elite club. Our other classmates looked at us jealously because we had to sit together at the back of the class, never had to do homework, and were never called out unexpectedly to answer questions in front of the whole class. Being the immature seventh grade students that we were, we abused the amazing @ TIME1 opportunity we had. I quickly befriended the other three people at @ ORGANIZATION2. Their names were @ PERSON4, @ PERSON3 and @ CAPS3. @ PERSON4 and I were already friends, but it was working together at @ ORGANIZATION2 that really brought us together. I have also become close to @ ORGANIZATION3 and @ CAPS3. As of @ TIME1, @ PERSON4 is one of my best friends and I still keep in touch with the other two. We were all very different from each other. @ PERSON3 got caught up in the popular crowd, @ CAPS3 usually hung out with the really smart kids who liked chess and read books, and @ PERSON4 and I were just normal. However, we all had two important things in common; our sick sense of humor and our intelligence. We each felt that the work we were teaching each other was far too easy. We scanned the book in the blink of an eye and never really had any questions. By doing @ CAPS8, we always got our assigned work done quickly and we had over half the class left to just sit, eat, and fool around. It doesn't necessarily mean that this is the order in which things turned out. "@ PERSON4, I don't feel like doing math @ DATE2. I'm beaten," I complained as we walked into @ PERSON1's math room right after lunch. "Neither @ CAPS6," she replied. "I say we just sit there and make it look like we're working." We walked over to the table at the back where @ CAPS3 and @ PERSON3 were already seated. They had taken out their books, pencils, and spirals, but sat there with blank expressions. @ PERSON4 and I joined them seated and we all exchanged angry looks. "@ CAPS8 uh, I was talking to @ LOCATION1 @ TIME1 and he said we don't have to do any work @ DATE2. We can just sit here and hang out," I lied, not even bothering to hide my smirk. Catching, @ CAPS3 and @ PERSON3 smiled. @ PERSON3 turned around and took out a brown paper bag from his backpack. She started to take food out of the bag and offered us everything. I immediately grabbed the miniature chocolate pie. Halfway through eating it I dipped my finger in the gooey chocolate and wiped a big drop on the window behind @ CAPS6. @ PERSON4 noticed and immediately started to laugh. "@ CAPS10, what is this ?!" she exclaimed, loud enough for everyone in the class to hear her. @ PERSON1 and a few classmates gave a quick glance, but instantly returned to the lesson. It really wasn't funny at all, but the four of us dissolved into giggles. “@ CAPS11 guys I had a crazy dream of @ TIME1 @ TIME2,” @ PERSON3 said as the laughter died down. "I went to camp @ TIME1 @ DATE1, and @ PERSON2 was one of the camp counselors. He was wearing khaki pants and a white shirt with pinstripe blue. Oh, and he also had a notepad !" We stared blankly at her, then burst out laughing once more. The funny thing about @ TIME1 is that @ PERSON2 often stood in for our teachers, and he wore exactly that outfit every time. But the funny thing is, it really wasn't funny at all. We were @ CAPS8 desperate to have a good time, found chocolate drips on the windows and some hilarious khaki pants. Our laughter died down and we sat there in silence. Suddenly @ CAPS3 leaned back in his squeaky swivel chair and it immediately snapped, dropping him to the floor. For anyone else @ TIME1 would have been funny. However, we each sat in silence, looking at each other. It wasn't that we were embarrassed for him or felt any sympathy, but just ironic that outdated things made us laugh out loud, when a substantial, laughable event just made us just sit there. I think I will never forget the @ ORGANIZATION2. Even though it was a waste of time, we had a lot of good laughs. We @ MONTH1 haven't learned a lot about math, but we've learned a lot from each other.
Lots @ CAPS1 for Laughs People always say that laughing can have many benefits. The truth, I believe, is that laughing is not always the best thing. Laughter can have many meanings. When I think of laughter, I think of smiles, happiness and memories. Although there is a memory of laughing that doesn't prove it's true. "@ CAPS2, I really don't want to be here. I don't know if I can stay here and tell her that," I begged @ CAPS11's mom from @ CAPS6 to come home. "@ CAPS3 must do that honey. @ CAPS8 is for the best." @ CAPS4 this point I always had although @ CAPS11's mother knew best. Now I wasn't so sure. I sat patiently, trying to hold back my tears, waiting for @ CAPS11's dad to come home. I knew he was at the bar and silently thanked him for the time to think. I had to go tell him how I felt about him still drinking alcohol. Every time I went there I saw him either drunk or on his way. The truth is, I was scared. I was afraid for his health and I was afraid to be the reason for his alcohol consumption. I was getting older and needed to tell her what I was thinking and feeling. Although distracted by this realization, he stormed through the door. I looked at @ CAPS11's drunken dad and @ CAPS11's heart dropped. I burst into tears as @ CAPS11's mom hugged me. "@ CAPS5 ... @ CAPS8 it's okay," she soothed him. @ CAPS11 father looked at me without any recognition and went into the other room. I walked into the room he was in and watched him cautiously through the open door. He was no longer the man @ CAPS11's mother had once married. He had become a monster. I couldn't take @ CAPS8 anymore. I walked into the room where @ CAPS11's mom was waiting with concern in her eyes. “@ CAPS6 come home,” I said. On the way home I sobbed until the @ CAPS11 shirt was streaked with tears. The drive to the house was silent and thoughts and sadness hung in the air. I could hardly sleep that night. The sun was shining on @ CAPS11's face as I woke up to a new day. I felt confident and ready to go back and confess to @ CAPS11 @ CAPS9 how I felt from the start. We walked back to his house and when we pulled into the driveway nervousness rushed through me. I wobbled to the door and knocked. "@ CAPS7. Hi." @ CAPS8 made me upset that @ CAPS11's dad was acting like nothing had happened. I entered, confidently, and asked him to sit down. I was glad that I had caught him in one of those rare moments when he wasn't drunk. "@ CAPS9, we really need to talk. I feel like @ CAPS3 is making a huge mistake while drinking. I know @ CAPS10 is addicted and there are risks in quitting, but @ CAPS3 also puts endangering @ CAPS10's health ! " Basically, I yelled at him. I poured out @ CAPS11's heart as a whole new wave of tears rushed over me. By the time I was done @ CAPS11, the dad was sitting there with a blank stare plastered on his face. He's laughing. "@ CAPS10's mom told @ CAPS3 to tell me this stuff. Don't worry about @ CAPS8. @ CAPS10 @ CAPS2 doesn't know what she's talking about." @ CAPS11 jaw dropped as he acted like it was okay. Anger was boiling inside me. "@ CAPS3 doesn't even know me! @ CAPS3 doesn't even care about me!" I screamed and then stormed out. I went into the living room and looked directly at @ CAPS11's mom and somehow she knew exactly that I wanted to leave. This time the drive, once again, seemed to be filled with silence. Thinking about the fact that laughter is almost always a good thing, I started to cry because once laughing was not synonymous with happiness. @ CAPS8 meant tears.
Laugh @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 "@ CAPS5, we have something to say to @ CAPS3." I knew @ CAPS9 they were about to tell me. I saw the signs. I knew @ CAPS8 they went to the other room, @ CAPS6 was not having a good time together. They were getting a divorce @ CAPS11 the time to tell me had come. As each of my parents gathered around me, I knew they were about to say something I wasn't ready to hear. The words " We're going to get a divorce " rang in my head like church bells @ CAPS8 a couple is getting married. The happiest sound @ CAPS3 has ever heard. But that was the exact opposite of @ CAPS9 happening right now. Looking up at my mother's face, I could tell she had been crying. Where the blue and gray mix met @ CAPS11 became one, @ CAPS6 had turned red @ CAPS11 irritated. @ CAPS6 killed me inside to see her cry, @ CAPS11 while this was happening my dad just sat on the couch next to me with his head buried in his hands. I could tell he thought he was so in love with @ CAPS11 that @ CAPS6 just broke down leaving him with intense resentment @ CAPS11 angry at my mom. The love of his life was now his enemy. When I was seven, I couldn't quite understand that @ CAPS9 was happening to our family. Realized that a parent would move out, that I wouldn't always be in bed at night by a loving duo, I just didn't understand @ CAPS7 that this had to happen. My poor little brother. Only four, how could they explain that to him. If I was confused he must have gone to another planet. At the thought of my family collapsing in front of my eyes, I wanted to cry. I wanted to go far, far away from the troubles that are happening at home. If a genius had been there to make my three wishes come true, I would have used all three if I thought there was any possibility of saving my parents' relationship. Crying seemed so much easier than sitting in the living room listening to my parents say, "@ CAPS6 isn't your fault, don't blame yourself, it's between your dad @ CAPS11 I." Did @ CAPS7 think these statements made @ CAPS6 better ? Because @ CAPS6 really didn't help. My parents had fallen in love with each other, @ CAPS11 my hope that they would get back together was dwindling faster than the amount of rainforest remaining at @ LOCATION1. Plus, there was always the underlying factor that my house was broken. @ CAPS11 more important than my home, my heart. @ CAPS6 was broken @ CAPS11 I didn't think there was enough super glue all over the world to put the pieces together. Just @ CAPS8 @ CAPS6 felt like the whole world was going to come crashing down on me, my mom told me something @ CAPS1 never forgets. "@ CAPS8 @ CAPS3 want to cry, to laugh. Remember all the good times we had together as a family." One by one, each memory started to come back to my mind. @ CAPS8 dad jumped into the pile of leaves that we had collectively raked. The time @ CAPS8 mom @ CAPS11 I made some winter sugar cookies that ended up burning but still made the whole house feel warm @ CAPS11 familiar. @ CAPS11 especially marriage which brought them together in marriage. This sacred bond that only ministers can make on people. The one who forever changed their life @ CAPS11 mine. I started to laugh, @ CAPS11 then to cry. My parents weren't sure @ CAPS9 was thinking about my sudden change in emotion. They asked "@ CAPS9 is wrong, @ CAPS10 ?" @ CAPS11 Me, still thinking that none of these memories would come back, so I realized something. I realized that even though my family wouldn't be together all the time, we were still laughing. This @ CAPS8 someone slipped on a piece of paper, @ CAPS6 would be funny. My tears had stopped spitting out of my eyes like a dam in desperate need of repair, @ CAPS11, the realization had finally set in that everything would be fine. That with laughter in our lives, @ CAPS11 memories in our hearts, we would survive this. From that moment on, I only believed that one statement my mother had made to me. "@ CAPS8 @ CAPS3 want to cry, to laugh." The statement that told me, @ CAPS6 is okay to be sad, but as long as @ CAPS3 is laughing in your life, everything @ CAPS1 will be fine. In my heart, I applauded my mother for handling this situation so well. If @ CAPS6 hadn't been for her, I would have continued with the hydraulic work @ CAPS11 never stopped for a second to think about all the hilarious times we had together. So, when it comes to laughter, don't forget to take a moment out of each day to remember every punchline with every nerdy joke, @ CAPS6 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4.
Laughter, the feeling of pure happiness. You are in the moment @ CAPS1 nothing else matters, all your worries @ CAPS1 stress are gone, leaving you with your true happy self. Have you ever had those times when everything seems too much? Then a friend says something that makes you laugh, once you are done laughing you start to cry because it was so good to laugh. Or when you laugh so hard you fall to the floor @ CAPS1 can't get up for what seem like hours? Yet, looking back, you forget what was so funny. Laughter is magic, @ CAPS7 behind love. These two seem to go hand in hand. When you love someone, not just your boyfriend / girlfriend but also your friends @ CAPS1 family, you know how to make them laugh or cheer them up, how to have fun with them, @ CAPS1 that brings you even closer . When I'm with friends from @ CAPS16 the thing we seem to do the most is laugh. We laugh at everything @ CAPS1 of everything that is even a little funny. He brings us closer, shares a moment of joy. The six of us are very close @ CAPS1 will be friends after the end of @ ORGANIZATION1 high, even though we go to colleges thousands of miles away. It is because we have shared so many happy memories. Laughter is important in a relationship. We trust each other, @ CAPS1 can share everything with them, even our most important secrets. This story is how we got so close. Brightly colored fancy dresses @ CAPS1 killer in high heels were displayed in the room. Open soda cans @ CAPS1 bags of crisps. The slight smell of nail polish, floral perfume, deodorant @ CAPS1 lingers in the air. Laughs @ CAPS1 chuckled around the room with occasional screeches. Black on the outside but light @ CAPS1 warm on the inside. Six of us are lounging in the room. Smeared makeup @ CAPS1 deflates the hair. Sweatpants @ CAPS1 loose t-shirts. We all went from our best look to ... steps, in minutes. Yet none of us cared. Looking at each other we were able to see @ CAPS17 past appearances we had fun with each other, not how they looked. We had just returned from @ ORGANIZATION1. Neither of us had a date, but we still managed to have the best time of our lives. "@ CAPS1 did you see him ! He was dancing with her !" "I wouldn't really call it dancing…" she pelvic thrust we all broke out into a whole new set of laughs @ CAPS1 yelled stuff like "@ CAPS2, take a room!" We chatted about what we saw, who was with whom, cute dresses, steamy @ CAPS4, creeper @ CAPS4, slow dancing, music, even our @ CAPS8, we hid our cups to find out which one was ours when we wanted to use it again. We had all been friends, but recently we had become closer. Start moving from friends to best friends. It was at least @ NUM1 @ CAPS3. Everyone was exhausted but forcing themselves to stay awake with caffeine @ CAPS1 sugar. You @ MONTH1 ask why, but I'm not really sure. Maybe because we always seem to have so much to say to each other, because we enjoy each other's company, or just because we can, so why not? "@ CAPS4 I think we need to a photo, a photo of the six of us. " I said. "@ CAPS5!" "@ CAPS6" "@ CAPS7 now ? I'm in a mess !" "I have exactly what I need !" @ PERSON1 runs upstairs to grab something. "@ CAPS8 should we sit down ?" "@ CAPS9 is reading it ?" "@ CAPS10, @ CAPS5 ! Get moving on the big" "@ CAPS11 ! I'm not not fat, I'm celebrating plump! " We all fell in love with the @ LOCATION1 reference as we started to squeeze into a corner of the spongy double bed. @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1's mother comes back into the room. @ PERSON1 was carrying an old @ ORGANIZATION2 camera that prints the photo immediately after you take it. She gave the camera to her mom @ CAPS1 jumped @ CAPS9 on the bed. We all crashed into each other, barely enough room to breathe. " One two Three ! @ CAPS12 ! the photo came out. "@ CAPS13 Take one more while the first one grows. One more ... two ... three!" @ CAPS14 ! @ CAPS12 ! "@ CAPS15 !!!" We all cried out in unison. The bed broke! we had broken the bed! We were all sitting there, clinging to each other, in total shock. "@ CAPS16 reads! You @ CAPS4 are faaaaat ..." @ PERSON1 said trying to contain a laugh. Suddenly we were in hysteria. Even @ PERSON1's mother was laughing. We were a big, nagging laughter. Only the corner of the bed had broken, so we were all dragged into that corner. Then someone started tickling, it was war. Every girl for himself. It was a mass of sheets, squirming fingers, bare feet biting @ CAPS1 a lot of laughter. "@ CAPS17 the images have expanded." The first showed us sitting together, smiling, but the second was caught just as the bed broke. It showed @ CAPS9 shock on our faces as we held onto each other for support. Not only did this literally bring us closer together, but it sparked our incredible friendship.
Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. For some reason, humans love to laugh, and they love to make others laugh too. But it reminds me of a funny story ... There was this time when I had to take a writing test. In fact, the test looked a lot like this one. In fact, it was this one. I had to write on one of the four topics. Unfortunately, all four were about as vague as they could get, which made the choice quite difficult. After staring at the screen for a good fifteen minutes, I started to laugh silently at my situation: I have to write about one of the four things when none of them was even a little interesting. For some reason, I found my problematic situation funny, because I'm a little weird that way. But then it hit me ... one of the four topics was on laughter ... why not write about me laughing at the irony of my situation? Yep, all I had to do was tell a true story about a time I laughed, so I used that delicious blur to my advantage. The topic did not indicate that laughter had to be actually audible, nor what kind of laugh it had to be, so I figured that a silent laugh with irony would do as well as an audible laugh at something stupid. . So now I had my subject. To make things even more fun, as I wrote about myself laughing that I had to write about myself laughing, I started laughing at the silliness of the task I was performing. However, I started to worry that whoever is grading these things @ MONTH1 might not find it as funny as I did, which might hurt my grade. But this possibility only served to make the situation even more ironic, and therefore amusing. You @ MONTH1 think I am easily amused, but by that I have to say: well, yes I kinda am. I can find almost anything funny, but that's, I find, the beauty of laughter. It's so abstract that each person experiences it differently. Some @ MONTH1 people find very simple things a lot of fun, but others @ MONTH1 don't have so easily. These differences are part of the reason why interacting with other people is so enjoyable. Like I said before, humans love to laugh and we love to make others laugh with us. And however you @ MONTH1 interpret the abstract form of laughter, you have to admit it, it's pretty funny.
Someone once told me that laughter is the key to comfort. I believe @ CAPS7 is one of the most important parts of any relationship. @ CAPS7 is what brings people together. A perfect example; About two years ago, in the middle of fall, I was crying over the passing of my dog. My ex-boyfriend tried everything to make me feel better, but nothing was working. I was so hurt that I told him I just wanted to be alone and he got it. As he walked away, he slipped and landed in a puddle. The way he fell reminded me of the cartoon SpongeBob SquarePants @ CAPS1, when @ ORGANIZATION1 slipped on a banana and fell hard. I looked at him and his whole ass was soaked. Her cheeks were cherry red with embarrassment. I burst out laughing, couldn't help @ CAPS7. He saw that the water had invaded me, then he laughed. It was a moment of comfort brought by laughter. Whenever we had a problem we could always laugh at @ CAPS7. This is actually how I met him. I was hanging out with some friends and we decided to go see a movie called Step- @ CAPS2. There was this one where one of the characters said, "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS3 it was so funny, last time I heard I laughed so hard I fell off my dinosaur" then another character looked like he was going to cry. I thought it was so funny. After the movie ended, my friend @ PERSON1 suggested we go back to his place. When we arrived, @ CAPS4 was waiting on the steps @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 stepped back for a second then said: "Ah, you were expecting me little one." @ CAPS4 replied: "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS3 it was so funny, the last time I heard I laughed so hard I fell from my dinosaur." I laughed so hard I almost went to the bathroom on my own. @ CAPS4 and I were the only ones laughing and we just clicked. If he wasn't funny, I can honestly say I would never have been with him. I like to laugh. I think @ CAPS7 is the easiest way to trigger the best emotions.
About @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 is a true story about a time I spent with two of my friends / team members named @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON1. When we walked @ CAPS3 cheerleader practice on a @ DATE1 @ TIME1. We had a good laugh going @ CAPS3 @ NUM1 and I was cold because we were in shorts and sweatshirts, @ CAPS8 we put on balaclavas @ CAPS1. @ CAPS6 @ PERSON3 wanted @ CAPS3 to put on her hood too @ CAPS8 she didn't feel alone but her hood was @ CAPS3 small and with thick hair it only made it worse for her. @ CAPS8 she got tired @ CAPS3 put on her hood anyway and her hair is on the top of her head and her curls are at the bottom of her hair. @ CAPS8 when she put her hood on made her look like a poodle. When we had @ CAPS3, the end of the block I live in @ PERSON1 said his foot hurt, @ CAPS8 I told him I would give him a pig back in the car. @ CAPS8 she rode on my back, and I told her @ CAPS13 we get @ CAPS3 the end of this block dropped me off and we can cross the street @ CAPS6 give me a piggyback ride, @ CAPS8 @ PERSON1 m 'gave a piggyback ride. @ CAPS8 when we crossed over and @ CAPS6 we told @ PERSON3 it was his turn @ CAPS3 give one of us a piggyback ride, I was about to @ CAPS3 get on @ back of @ PERSON3 the @ PERSON1 said "@ CAPS5 just had a turn ! Now it's my turn !" @ CAPS6 I was like "@ CAPS7 @ PERSON1. Okay @ PERSON3 give me your backpack and your water bottle." @ CAPS8 @ PERSON3 gave his @ CAPS3 stuff to me and gave @ PERSON1 a piggyback ride. @ CAPS6 @ CAPS13 we got @ CAPS3 at the end of the block, I told @ PERSON3 that she now has @ CAPS3 to give me a piggyback ride. @ CAPS6 @ PERSON3 was like “@ CAPS9! I'm @ CAPS3 tired” At the end of this conversation she gave me what I wanted. At the end of that last block @ PERSON3 landed me and @ CAPS6 we crossed the street. @ CAPS6 @ CAPS1 @ ORGANIZATION1 walked past us shouting "@ CAPS10 !" @ CAPS6 we turned around @ CAPS3 to see who yelled that at us, and we found out it was @ CAPS1 @ ORGANIZATION1. @ CAPS6 I said "@ CAPS12 look it's @ PERSON2! She's actually here on time!" @ CAPS13 @ ORGANIZATION1 @ PERSON2 us three girls started @ CAPS3 just burst out laughing. We started laughing at @ CAPS3 because of what @ PERSON2 was yelling at us. @ CAPS8 when @ PERSON2 got out of his car, we had just received @ CAPS3 his car. She approached us from @ CAPS3 and we started talking about @ CAPS3 and walked into the school where we practice. As we were walking I said @ CAPS3 @ PERSON2 "@ CAPS5 are actually here on time !" @ CAPS6 @ ORGANIZATION1 responded by saying "I know, don't I ?!" We finally have @ CAPS3 the doors @ PERSON2 said "@ CAPS12 everyone is here today !" @ CAPS8 this is a good laugh time with more than @ CAPS6 just one person. Go @ CAPS3 this practice was a blast that night. That night was fantastic going to practice @ CAPS3 to cheer on. Hope @ CAPS3 has fun with @ CAPS3 again.
Freshmen @ CAPS1 All freshmen @ CAPS1 were fun @ CAPS1. There was this boy who made me smile and laugh. I swore I was falling in love. We had a class together. Who was called @ CAPS2. Crossing over in the hallway would just make my @ DATE1. We met in a class that we both didn't like. I asked her for help even though I didn't need it just so I could talk to her. We also saw each other at the pool because her brother swam and so did I. I would see it during @ DATE1 but not very often. Instead of him helping me, we would sit down and talk about our life at school and at home. The first semester is over and he left the class for another class period. We were still talking at the pool and seeing each other during school @ DATE1. He was now going to hug me in the hallway. We started to become very close friends. Talking has brought us closer together. Laughter was a big part of our conversations. We have found that we have a lot in common. Like the hunt, the wheel, the food, the favorite dog and our personalities are so alike, it seems like we grew up around each other. @ MONTH1 came for about a month more of school. I started going to his house from time to time. He came to my house more often. At the start of @ DATE4, the strawberry festival arrived and I asked him to come with me. He said okay and his parents also went but with my parents. This @ DATE3 was fun and enjoyable. The end of @ DATE4 was finally here, the school was released in a @ DATE1. Summer vacation was here. The school's @ DATE1 @ DATE1 was fun. It was going to be so nice not having homework during @ DATE3 or during the week. All we did on @ DATE1 school was sign @ CAPS1 books and tell funny @ CAPS1 school stories. After school I went to swimming training and after training he was still at the pool waiting for his brother. We were outside chatting and all of a sudden I didn't know where he had asked me " are you going out with me " ? I said yes! He made me one of the happiest girls in the world this @ DATE1. Today at @ DATE2 we're still dating. The one and only relationship I have ever had. Hope we @ DATE1. He tells me almost every @ DATE1 that he's going to marry me. He tells me he doesn't know what he would do without me. I told everyone I swore I was falling in love. Now everyone knows that I fell in love. I fell in love at first sight. We talk and laugh all the time, we hardly ever have an argument.
When I was younger I really liked going fishing. I've always been there with my two friends @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1. We loved catching @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 head and sometimes @ CAPS3. We fished a lot while we were camping. One day when we were fishing the head of @ CAPS2 and it was not going very well. It was very cold and it was even snowing. We were about to leave when @ PERSON1 hooked one up during their last casting. He yelled at me that he was going to catch up with this so I jumped off the four wheeler and ran towards him. When I saw the fish I thought it was a @ CAPS1. This was by far the biggest @ CAPS2 head we have ever seen. As he was rewinding it he said it was really loud and I could see he was having issues. After a few minutes he began to pick up the fish near the shore. We all started to relax and think the day was going to be good now. Just as @ PERSON1 told me to retrieve the net he slipped and fell straight into the river and let go of the pole. water after the post. Once @ PERSON2 and I saw him swimming and struggling, we decided to jump in and help him catch his fish. The three of us were swimming as fast as we could in the cold water past a pole and I was almost there. As soon as I got about a foot from the post the fish started swimming faster. While trying to get the pole I wasn't focused on where I was going and got stuck in a tree so it was up to @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 to get the pole . The pursuit of the floating fishing rod had now lasted more than five minutes and we were all very far down the river. Now @ PERSON2 was very close to the pole and @ PERSON1 and I were just catching up with him. Suddenly @ PERSON2 shouted that he had got the rod, so we all swam to shore to bring back the fish. At that point we were very happy that we went to the icy river after this fish and couldn't wait to come home and dry off. After a few minutes @ PERSON2 was still spinning in the huge fish. He said he didn't know how he was going to get her to shore. Once the fish got very close to the shore @ PERSON2 rocked the perch as hard as he could to bring it to the shore, but as he was pulling the line snapped and the fish ran away. All of our hard work was wasted. After that, we decided it was time to come home and sit by the fire. A lot of people I tell this story to think it's funny but I personally don't see anything funny about swimming in the snow to break your fishing line. A good thing is that it was the most memorable day of fishing I have ever had.
Once, when I was staying overnight at @ ORGANIZATION1, she wanted to sleep outside in a tent. @ CAPS2 was @ DATE1 and we always tried to see each other at all times because she often had to return to boarding school. So her mother set up the tent for us on the deck, and after we had dinner, we took our things and went out. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and I was on the phone with mine, and they were both best friends. @ CAPS2 was like two best friends dating two best friends, and we were closer than ever. My boyfriend had to hang up because he had work at @ TIME1 so @ CAPS2 was just @ LOCATION1 on the phone. I started to say some really funny things and she laughed so hard she sniffled and at that point she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. At this point I was giggling, @ ORGANIZATION1 started laughing even louder because she saw me laughing and peed while she was on the phone with her boyfriend. For some reason she forgot she was on the phone with him and started laughing even more after it happened, so this was all around one o'clock on @ TIME1 and I was surprised that her mother didn't come out and yell at her. us for being loud. When I looked and saw that she had peed I screamed "@ CAPS1 my god, @ CAPS3 got peed @ ORGANIZATION1!" @ CAPS2 was the funniest thing, I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my life. So her boyfriend finally got her attention and said "@ CAPS3 should probably take care of this" and then they hung up. She was really embarrassed after that, I mean I would be too if that happened to me.
@ ORGANIZATION1 is one of the many joys that I love to share with people. I love to laugh, I don't know where I would be if I didn't laugh. My cousin; @ CAPS1 and I are usually together for most of @ DATE1 and the truth is, we're not supposed to have energy drinks. the father of @ CAPS1 ; @ PERSON1, gave us a monster to split up and that day we were going to @ ORGANIZATION2 at @ LOCATION1. After about ten minutes of drinking the whole monster, me who drank the most, I was the one who remained calm. @ CAPS1 on the other hand, who had a few sips, was going crazy. She would run down the aisles and stumble on her own feet. She almost overturned the cart with me at the end. @ ORGANIZATION1 hysterical for no apparent reason is normal for her. Wendy ; @ PERSON1's wife and my little cousin started to get hungry, so we went for pizza at the @ ORGANIZATION2 cafe there. My mom called me and I was trying to pull my phone out of my pocket to answer while trying to hold my hot plate of pizza. I returned my plate to @ CAPS1 because my plate was slipping out of my socket. She was holding her food in her other hand, she touched the bottom of my plate and told me it was very hot so she passed it on to @ PERSON1 who was not paying attention and he had not a good grip on it and my pizza fell to the floor, pizza side down. It was so embarrassing that everyone was looking at us. After this embarrassing moment, @ PERSON1 realized he had forgotten the churos, so he told @ CAPS1 to go get them. We all three realized her mistake as soon as @ CAPS1 left, because @ CAPS1 is a klutz and we probably messed it up by saying that @ CAPS1 is probably going to drop them. ”We were a little surprised that she didn't hadn't dropped them yet., as soon as we thought about it and she put them on the table, one of the churos fell off the table and out of the wrapper. We were @ ORGANIZATION1 so strong that we couldn't breathe. @ CAPS1 was so embarrassed by her mistake she turned bright red. We felt bad for poor @ CAPS1, but couldn't help but laugh because of the way it was funny. She knew it was funny but she didn't want to laugh at herself. One of the things I usually say if you can't and don't want to laugh at yourself then you don't have fun. That's why I think it's so important to laugh because you have to learn how to have fun when it's da ns a situation that you need to laugh at yourself but don't want to. This is one of the best ways to have fun with @ ORGANIZATION1, because you know you made a stupid little mistake that you think everyone saw, all you need to do is laugh about it . But you won't feel too embarrassed or ashamed to admit that you made a small mistake. Sometimes it's your job to go to them, pat them on the back and tell them that everyone makes mistakes, that you have to learn to be stupid in a tough situation and that no one is. perfect. Tell them to laugh, it helps and you will feel better once you realize that when life knocks you down, pick yourself up because that's what life is all about. It's the only way to learn from your mistakes and from life. Laughter is really important, the more you laugh, the better you feel and the better you feel, the more fun you will have. Laughter fixes everything, it's a band-aid for the little things that happen in life. "
A @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I once heard "laughter is the best medicine". I believe it is. I could laugh all day, find anything funny @ CAPS9 in the @ CAPS3 world. Laughter is important to me, without it life would be boring. Sometimes laughter feels good @ CAPS9 comes from the heart. Other times it can be cruel @ CAPS9 means. I like to avoid @ CAPS9's cruel laugh, @ CAPS9 stick to the good laugh. When a friend of mine laughs @ CAPS9 with a smile, it makes me want to know @ CAPS10 that they're laughing at, so I can laugh too. Birthdays are fun, laughter usually comes with fun. I remember my twelfth @ CAPS2, I decided to throw a party at my house. I wanted it to be extra special so I invited my closest friends, @ CAPS9 my cousins. Family always makes everything special. My cousin @ CAPS9 I'm pretty close, she was born nine months after me, so we've both been the same age for a little while. We always have a great time, we both act like crazy @ CAPS9 always laughing. For my birthday my mom made a rainbow sorbet punch, it was delicious. Everyone had fun, @ CAPS9 soon the party was over, but my cousins did were leaving the next day so we continued the party. I was in the kitchen to have more oomph, my cousin came in @ CAPS9 also wanted more. I served us both a drink. "@ CAPS3 is so good!" my cousin @ PERSON1 said. "I know that's why my mom did it" "@ CAPS4 wanna hear a joke?" "@ CAPS5." @ PERSON1 said. "@ CAPS6, @ CAPS7 was once a kid named itchy butt he was really sick @ CAPS9 died one day his mother cried to the doctor," @ CAPS8 my poor itchy butt! "" @ CAPS9 @ CAPS12, @ CAPS4 you wanna know @ CAPS10 the doctor said? "" @ CAPS10? "@ CAPS11 @ PERSON1." @ CAPS12 it's itchy! "@ PERSON1 had just had a glass of punch when I said @ CAPS3. She spat it out. punch from his mouth while laughing got me all over the place. Usually when someone spits or spills something on you you get mad. I started laughing out loud, @ CAPS9 too. "@ CAPS8 my God ! It's so disgusting. "" @ NUM1 @ CAPS9 I couldn't stop laughing. The joke wasn't that funny it was the punch all over me @ CAPS9 the kitchen. We laughed for at least fifteen minutes before we even realized our two moms were standing in the kitchen. They were just looking at us wondering if @ CAPS10 in the world had happened. You'd think getting punched in your face on your @ CAPS2 would drive you crazy. @ CAPS3 is the reason laughter makes ordinary days special. In my case, laughter was the shortest distance between @ PERSON1 @ CAPS9 I. It would have to be short for it to hit me that much. Laughter made @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2 extra special, because I will never forget my twelfth @ CAPS2.
@ CAPS10 @ CAPS10 @ CAPS10, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1, and now even @ CAPS2 (@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5). To laugh! some say this is the best median. It can brighten up a cloudy day, cure a case of the blues, and even soothe a broken heart. On the other hand, a simple lead or a small laugh can break your heart! I had a firsthand experience of listening to wacky screams being thrown at me and not because I had told a witty joke just to sit up, sit in my classroom @ NUM1 and become the cornerstone of my pear jokes. Before continuing with this story, there are a few things @ CAPS6 should know. Not to mention the fact that all of @ NUM1's students have an undeniable common erg to bring people down so that they can build themselves up. I was an @ NUM1 evaluator whose weight had reached the point where my doctors were telling me "@ CAPS6 should look into a weight loss program". this news alone crushed me in a haze and the laughter of my classmates soon made me cry. I remember one particular @ CAPS7, possibly one of the worst. I was on the bus and almost home when @ NUM4 girls who I thought were my friends started laughing. I had no idea it was me they were laughing at, so I joined in on what I was thinking and what sounded like a laugh from @ CAPS8. Suddenly they stopped, looked at me and started whispering, then one of the girls let out @ CAPS4 between laughs “@ CAPS6 looks like a failed moan!”. She said this then @ CAPS5 the whole bus herd and immediately burst out laughing spitting. I walked the same street that I walked every day the bus dropped me off. That day it looked darker than ever. It was the day I decided that I was never going to set foot on the bus again! It was laughter encounters like this that broke my heart but also gave me a strong motivation to lose weight and regain my confidence. Days, weeks, months, even years have passed that day in the @ NUM1 class. I am @ NUM6 pounds less, a college cheerleader and have proven who I am. The roles have turned for me in many ways. I'm no longer the person to be laughed at because of my weight, but sometimes I catch myself making a joke or two without thinking at someone else's expense. I remember the other day I was with my best friend at the mall. She spotted this girl who was overweight and immediately started laughing and nudging me on the side trying to get my attention to her like she was a freak. When I saw the girl my first reaction was a hideous @ CAPS3, but as soon as I did I felt the same pain I felt when that bus full of my pears laughed of me. I stopped immediately, realizing the pain my laughter could have brought him. Myself, I'm a very funny person and will do just about anything for a @ CAPS3. But when it comes to laughing at people and hurting their feelings, this is where I draw the line because I know what it feels like to be in this position and I hope my story helps you open up. the eyes of you and others on the detrimental effects laughter can have. So go ahead and @ CAPS10 @ CAPS10 @ CAPS10, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 and even @ CAPS2 just not at the expense of another person's feelings.
Laughter is a big part of my life and I believe @ CAPS1 should laugh in a good and healthy relationship. It's a true story about laughter and it affects my life. Laughter is good for your body, mind and soul, it lightens my mood when I'm feeling down. I'm happy to say that I have a lot of connections, many of which are blessed with laughter. My mom and I have a great relationship together, and almost every time we're in the same room together there's bound to be laughter. My mom and I laugh all the time, about nonsense. We laugh just for laughs and most of the time we don't even know what we are laughing at. She can make me laugh at the most ridiculous things. I'm also pretty sure she's the only person who can make me spit my drink all over the dashboard just because of a silly face she made. My mom isn't the only one I can have a good time with. I remember a conversation I had with a good friend of mine, it was about how people laughed. I told him how I noticed people usually laugh with different vowel sounds, like a, e, and o. It seemed strange to me that I had never heard people laugh in those vowels and not me and you. She was thinking the same as me, so we had this idea of laughing in the vowels I and u. Sure, people were too busy with their own lives to notice us laughing weirdly, but it was fun nonetheless. @ CAPS1 never really realizes how hard it is not to laugh until the opportunity presents itself @ CAPS1. My mom and I were at my aunt's house desperately trying not to laugh too much. We had all decided to make a cleansing face mask that we had seen on @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. The mask itself was made from beaten egg whites and toilet paper. @ CAPS1 Soak the toilet paper in the egg whites and smear it all over the face. @ CAPS1 must wait at least fifteen minutes or until it is completely dry before @ CAPS1 can remove it, otherwise it will not work. The three of us did as the instructions told us to do, but we were dismayed when we saw the end results of our efforts. We weren't upset because we looked repulsive, we were upset because we all looked like a bunch of crazy ladies, and we found it extremely difficult not to laugh out loud. My mom and aunt's site was so ridiculously funny that I had to leave the room for fifteen minutes so my face could dry. After about fifteen minutes, I returned to find my mom and aunt in the bathroom drying their faces with a hair dryer. After seeing this I couldn't take it anymore, I started to cry with laughter, my mask cracked and all my hard work fell apart. that day was one of the funniest days of my life, we laughed together so much that our abdomens hurt. I love to laugh as I have said before and I personally have many different forms of laughter. when i laugh really hard i laugh all the air in my lungs and i forget to breathe. What that looks like to other people, I have no idea, but I must be a red-faced girl rocking back and forth. Other times I kind of have a manly ha ha, but if you're lucky @ CAPS1 will be able to hear me sniffle. What I'm trying to say is laughter is a good thing and it's made a big difference in my life, I don't know what I would do without it. I love to laugh, I think I would die if I couldn't laugh.
The laughter in me. For me, all you need to do to get through a tough, horrible day is a good @ CAPS5. It gives you hope throughout the day, and whatever your mood, when you leave work, go to school, or really any activity that involves a moment of ' sighing '. For me, I have this feeling about school, but I can always count on my best friend, @ PERSON1. Every day she manages to say something totally irrelevant, and we end up laughing at the top of the stairs near the science labs where we had lunch. When people pass by, they give us weird looks, we don't care because we understand each other. For me @ CAPS9 is my way of reliving stress My @ CAPS1 agrees with me his name is @ CAPS2 I call him @ ORGANIZATION1. We've been best friends since second year. She is my rock. She inspires me to do something with my life, something more than working in a fast food restaurant. I spend a lot of time with her at her home and we share so many great and fun memories. It's really bad when we're around each other, it's like looking at each other and boom !, I'm on the floor without breathing because I'm dying of laughter. I don't know what it is, but it's like when we see each other, it's a headlong rush from all the good times we had getting together. Sometimes we @ CAPS5 hysterically for nothing. I don't make sense, but I guess it doesn't matter when you're hanging out with your best friend. Laughter is an important part of my relationship with anyone. It shows me how fun a person can be and if they have a good sense of humor. It shows me that they can smile and some don't want to be perfect robots. All @ PERSON1 and I talk about are boys and boys issues and it makes me @ CAPS5 and laugh, but when we're in our fifth forestry and fire class we're like caged monkeys in a zoo. It's like we're magically ' lifted up ', all of a sudden we have this burst of energy. We sit side by side and tickle each other and @ CAPS5 very loud. At the end of the class I make a paper ball and we play paper soccer ball, it's fun especially when the teacher gives you dirty looks and tells you to stop and you don't. Let's just say her face turns a very bright red color. Nothing compares to how much I @ CAPS5 when I'm with @ ORGANIZATION1. When I went to @ CAPS3, I had three classes with her @ ORGANIZATION3, @ ORGANIZATION2 and @ CAPS4. We had lunch together too but anyway like I said I swear we had a non stop @ CAPS9 war every day. My @ CAPS5 is more like a cackle mixed with laughter. Some people like it, some think it's cute, others think I @ CAPS5 funny (the weird kind of funny). In @ ORGANIZATION2 she was standing next to me and she was looking at me weird, or saying something that wasn't going well, or singing obnoxiously, whatever she was doing made me crack it was so distracted when she was there but so much fun. I swear I had all of my @ CAPS9 exercises with it. At home, when my family is together, our way of laughing is mostly to pick on each other. It's different from laughing with your friends. We laugh at how my sister @ CAPS6 was meant to be a boy because everyone thought she was going to be a boy when she was in our mom's womb. We made fun of my brother because he was the only boy out of five children. We make fun of my sister @ PERSON2 for being the smallest in our family. I can feel the difference between laughing. It's mostly criticism in fact. I @ CAPS5 mainly because I feel more alive, it gives me something to experience everyday instead of "@ CAPS7 awesome, another day to try to pass, @ CAPS8 ... no." @ CAPS9 for me motivates me for the day when it's like my drug to go through life. It allows me to communicate easily with others. I thank @ CAPS10 for giving us the possibility of @ CAPS5 because without it I would lose my mind and have a hard time making friends. "This is how I make friends, I @ CAPS5."
The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 The beautiful flames were dancing so peacefully in the air of @ CAPS1. The faint flicker of the fire was the only light we had. As I watched the majestic destruction of the hot, humid air, I felt someone or something staring at me from behind. The weight of the sixty pounds of lumber started to get heavy as I walked from side to side of the house. Finally, I reached the trailer just for @ PERSON4, my best friend's mom, to tell me that she didn't think we would need that much wood. I thought it was going to be a long weekend. After about two hours of packing clothes, food, water, sleeping bags, pillows and tents, we made our way to @ ORGANIZATION1. It would be about two hours of driving, it felt like twenty minutes. @ PERSON3, @ PERSON1, @ PERSON2, @ PERSON4, and I were the worst bunch of people to put in one car. We all scream, fight and punch each other just for the fun of it. When we got to our destination, we sprang out of the car like a hive of angry bees. I am running @ PERSON2 to @ ORGANIZATION1. the second, we have finished unpacking our things. The first few days were spent lounging in the hundred degree heat, swimming and flirting with the random girls we found around the campsite. We slept as little as possible, so that we could enjoy the friendship and the pure pleasure we had. On the second day we decided to go mountain biking. We were on these bikes for hours before we noticed the sun was setting. The moment we all turned around and saw the most extravagant sight the earth has ever created. There were bursts of orange and red. Colors ricochet from cloud to cloud. After hours of biking in the heat, we chose to go swimming. As we were swimming I felt something touch my foot. Then all of a sudden there was a hand on my foot. When I looked down to see who was grabbing me, it was just a stick. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be the root system of a fallen tree. It looked fake, like someone or something had put it there. It did, however, spark a conversation on @ CAPS2 for the day ahead. The sparks were dancing together as if they were @ CAPS4 and @ LOCATION1. The only light we had was the bright glow of the fire. @ PERSON3 was playing a wonderful melody on his guitar. As I listened and enjoyed the perfection of nature, I felt someone looking back at me. I pushed @ PERSON3 and when we turned our hearts stopped. There was a spinning green light, nearly twenty feet in the air. I uttered the word everyone dreaded, @ CAPS2. I got up slowly and the light started to turn faster. I quickly grabbed the machete, which was next to me, and approached the light. As I got closer I could make out small figures in the shadows of @ CAPS1. Then an eruption of children's laughter came in full swing from the direction of the light. A little boy emerged, unable to control his laughter, and ran away. After I regained my place by the campfire, I thought about life. What if @ CAPS2 were real and they were looking at us. No, not real there. I laughed about it and continued my week's vacation.
What are you laughing at? Laughter is a great stress reliever. There are many different types of laughter in the world, some people's laughter is very high-pitched and others @ MONTH1 are very deep and low. Other people sniffle and make other animal noises. I know that for me I have many different types of laughter for all the emotions I feel. When I'm upset, I have a very peculiar laugh. Although when I'm upset I laugh to feel better and have a better day. Once, during a basketball game, I was spending a very slack night. Faults were reported on me left and right. Normally when this happens to me I get really angry and lose my mind and end up being taken out of the game and sitting on the bench. I absolutely hate sitting on the bench. This time I received a foul after already having been threatened with being sent off from the previous match for the same reason. I decided to just smile and laugh at the mistake and told myself to get rid of it. My coach was very happy with my change in attitude and just told me to play defense with my feet and get rid of the bad decision and keep the lead. When you're angry, a person can take away a lot from the demonstrative looks you can do, although if you smile and just laugh at it, their reactions will be very different. I'm not the only one on my basketball team who feels this way. Many of us laugh at the calls that are made and shake them up. I am also a cheerleader. When you are a cheerleader you should always try to have a smile on your face at all times and make you feel like you are in a good mood. I play a basketball game every night before going out and cheering. I have to do my best to keep my cool while playing in order to be in a good mood after my game when I cheer. Laughing really helps me keep my cool and relax while I play, so I'm in a good mood to cheer. My coach is also very important on people with positive attitudes. She tells us in training that if we smile and just laugh at things that are wrong, the outcome will be much better than if we have bad attitudes about it. I took it very hard and it stuck with me. My trainer influenced me to have a better attitude and since that day I have tried to have a positive attitude. I keep my positive attitude by smiling and laughing when things go wrong in my life. A laugh can go a long way. Personally, I think laughter helps express the mood you are in. Laughter is also good for the body. Laughing can make you feel a hundred times better when you're feeling down. I do my best to be in a good mood at all times. I really don't like to be in a bad mood, it's really no fun. Laughing makes me feel so much better. I think laughing is a very good function for the body. I feel like when I laugh my mood is better and the mood of the people around me is much better. Laughter is a magical feeling that runs through your body and makes you feel warm inside. I think everyone should laugh at least once a day. It will make your day much better.
Laughter is called the "best medicine". I don't believe that's true, but my nephew @ MOIS1 has other thoughts. My nephew was "sick" every school day for two weeks. “@ CAPS1 just doesn't like school,” I told her grandmother. The idea that school isn't fun and doesn't like it has changed dramatically for my nephew. We let him think it was going to be another boring school day, but it was a day of celebration for them. Every two weeks if they work hard they throw a party luckily for @ CAPS2 they have been working diligently. The stubborn side of my nephew was showing his ugly face that morning as @ CAPS1 fought off every move we made. When we walked through that narrow door, @ PERSON1 did something unusual, towards him and his five year old children all over @ LOCATION1. @ CAPS1 was as still and silent as a marble statue. He couldn't have been better prepared! Streamers, balloons, food, party hats and bags, they went all out for the first of the year. The aroma made me gurgling with desire. Mainly, they had desserts, cakes, cookies, pie, all cooked thirty yards from you. then you walk through that door and your mouth instantly fills with hot saliva. These kids were playing with a ninja-like ability, a moment in front of you you blink, and as fast as you blink, they're gone. It took me at least an hour to find @ PERSON1 in this small room. As I realized, it's easier to sit down and let them find you. As my butt touched the cold, hard and almost unbearable surface, @ PERSON1 was in front of me. @ CAPS1 had that ear-to-ear smile on his face that scared me, @ CAPS1 never had such a big smile on his face unless @ CAPS1 had a plan. @ CAPS1 definitely had a plan, within seconds my face was soaked. @ CAPS1 was hiding a water pistol behind his back and had planned the escape route. With the short chairs and tables, the way they sat on long legs and squeezed through them didn't go well together. It was extremely difficult to catch up in the room, but once we reached the hallway and I was able to stretch my legs, it was an easy run. His smile from ear to ear was gone once I grabbed him, but not the laughs from both sides. @ CAPS1 @ MONTH1 has my face but I have his head ! My nephew loves school now. It's almost the end of their first year, and they're still partying, but thanks to us no more water guns. I think if we had waited longer it would have taken a little more work for him to enjoy school. @ PERSON1 is a very intelligent, athletic and kind kid. @ CAPS1 will be doing great in school, and @ CAPS1 is strong so I pity the kid who fights him.
I know you listen to the same things over and over again, but I also know that a lot of people don't really respond to the prompt you give them. Well I'm sorry because I couldn't answer the prompt either. Can't remember the last time I had a really good @ CAPS3 in a few years, so I'll tell you why laughter is special to me instead. What is so special about laughter? For me, laughter helps us in so many ways. I'll talk about how healthy laughter is, how everyone's laughs are different, and we'll even @ CAPS3 to them. Also why laughter is so special to me. I always had this strange feeling in my head after laughing. I think it's because endorphins are produced in my brain. If I @ CAPS3 too hard, my stomach hurts because laughing also burns calories and works my abs. I also think it helps all three sides of the health triangle. My social life makes me @ CAPS3 with people. Laughing emotionally makes me happy. Plus, the physique is always fun when working out with a friend. I think everyone's @ CAPS3 is unique in its own way. I also know that sometimes it's fun to listen to other people laugh, snort, or sound like a mouse. Our laughs are another thing that makes us just, us! Laughing for me is special because of all the people who make me @ CAPS3. My friends are the family that I have chosen for myself. My family makes me @ CAPS3 and be happy everyday. It's special to me because these people are special to me. Laughing with my dad is nothing compared to me laughing with my mom. Laughing with my friends will never be like laughing with my significant other. My life is full of laughter and that's special to me. It's not like chewing gum. It is quite another thing. Nothing is more fun than having a girls night out and laughing the night away, or even going out dancing and having the most romantic night of your life. Laughter is a matter of life. So @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2, @ CAPS3.
Laughter has been a nonchalant but constant and strong force for me in many relationships. I believe laughter is helpful in getting to know the people you just met and connecting with those who are dear to you. In my opinion, @ CAPS2 brings people together and can turn a bad situation upside down. Getting enough courage to make new friends, invite that girl out, and eventually develop a good relationship with her, that's where laughter played a big part. @ CAPS2 was @ DATE1 I was fifteen and a sophomore at school @ ORGANIZATION1. @ CAPS2 was my first year there. I have been to many schools, @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS1 wood, etc. and like any new school, I had a hard time connecting socially with my peers. Every day I woke up, got ready, went to school, came home, did my homework (maybe), and went to bed. @ CAPS2 was a boring cycle I seemed to be trapped in. The image of being cool and trying to fit in didn't seem to work as much. Because one thing I realized is that trying to be cool and something that you are doesn't just get you that far. The only thing kids, people in general, love is when you are real and you are yourself. I found out later, but actually, I didn't know it was what people liked the most. I once told myself that I didn't like trying to act like someone or anything because the truth was I actually thought I was a cool person deep inside. So I changed my ways, stopped trying to be cool and acted like myself. And @ CAPS2 turned out to be really cool and girls found me attractive, and not just attractive, but a funny person who was likable. My main attribute, besides my appearance, was my ability to make people laugh or at least smile. @ CAPS2 has made me gain a lot of friends that I didn't have at the beginning. @ CAPS2 even made me one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen. Her name was @ LOCATION2, in my eyes no girl could compare to her in any way. She had the body of a coca cola bottle, the caramel skin and the face of a goddess (and I'm not exaggerating). Like any beautiful girl, she had many followers and admirers who looked like me. So what luck did I have? What did I, @ PERSON1 have to offer him ? To laugh. My greatest attribute which had come to my rescue several times. Even though @ CAPS2 didn't last as long as I would have liked @ CAPS2 (forever) @ CAPS2 was great to be with her for as long as I did, the things we had to do and the many experiences that we had together, are invaluable. And @ CAPS2 was due to my ability to make her laugh and make her smile. I guess without laughing, this world wouldn't be where @ CAPS2 is today. Of course, there are still crimes and many horrors and atrocities being committed today, but imagine how horrible @ CAPS2 would be without laughing. Joy, which I believe is at the heart of what laughter brings, allows us to forgive and forget. @ CAPS2 allows us to turn our heads and overlook things. Without us being able to laugh how could we hope to survive in the future
Laughter @ MONTH1 is the best part of life. It usually expresses the feeling of happiness and joy. The phrase almost seems contagious in a way, a laugh that goes along with a smile could make someone's day a whole lot better. Maybe the best part about laughing is that it's not hard to find, there is a lot in our world that is worth laughing at. Personally, I find myself laughing the most when I'm around people I love to be with. Some people think that the key to happiness @ MONTH1 is love or joy, or maybe being happy with yourself. I think the key is surrounding yourself with those you love and care for because everything looks better when they're there. They are comparable to the sun, everything is better in its presence. My favorite memory that involved excessive laughter came on a hot day @ DATE1 at my friend's house just outside the city limits. It had to be around @ NUM1 in @ TIME1. The air in @ DATE1 was warm, but not extremely hot. It seemed like the perfect afternoon. My friends and I would hang out, play soccer, build a fire and be happy. We had everything we needed to have the best night of our life. The most vivid memory I have is when we were playing wrestling I threw a deep pass to my friend and as he ran under the ball he ran straight into a fence. He stood up laughing, and the laughter spilled over. That, you might say, set the tone for the rest of the night. The rest of @ TIME1 looked like it was straight out of a movie. Everything was fine and we were all feeling fine. It was the epitome of happiness. Laughter was everywhere and smiles stretched across the faces of all of us. It was for me my best memory of laughing.
Laughter is the essence of life. Without laughing, my life would be meaningless, and without this feeling of happiness or compassion, life wouldn't be worth living. My sister is the only person I trust with my secrets. She's the only one who makes me happy when I'm feeling down. My sister and I laugh together at our own jokes. My sister is my other half and we share everything. She makes me laugh and is always there when I need her. I will always be there for her too. Laughter is an important part of life. @ CAPS2 my sister and I are laughing and playing. One day I got off the school bus, all I could do was cry. As I waited for my sister's bus to arrive, tears fell like a flowing river. The bus appeared and a feeling of joy arose with it. @ CAPS1, it was not the bus that made me happy. It was my sister, she immediately felt my pain and noticed my tears. I could see love and care in her face. She asked me what was wrong. I could hear the worry in his voice. My river of tears stopped and I began to speak. I could tell her everything, without trying or holding anything back. The words flowed into my mouth. @ CAPS1 has to think about what to say. I told him what happened without a break. Afterwards, she said something to me that I will never forget. She said: "@ CAPS1 no matter what, I will always love you." @ CAPS2 we laughed. It was the sweetest laugh. A chorus of laughter filled the air. Nothing people say about me is true, so I learned to laugh about it.
The night was dark and cloudy, giving my surroundings a dark silhouette. Shadows crossed the street by the light of the lamps of the passing cars and pedestrians. My day had been depressing and it seemed like karma was there to get hold of me. Anything that could go wrong ; went badly. And the rest of my night was only going to get worse. Earlier that day, I had upset my girlfriend with a statement that shouldn't have been made. Which caused her to call me as soon as I sat down on my bed. The words we exchanged left smoldering debris in our wake. Our conversation ended with fury and disconnection of phones. Once I lay down in my bed and my anger subsided, I started to feel overwhelming guilt. I said unnecessary and horrible things. As I lay down on my bed, my heart felt like it was slowing down from being squeezed by an invisible force. My breathing was labored and soon tears started to flow from my eyes. Guilt and agony crept into my soul like a burglar crawling through a dark house and stealing all the valuables I had left. My day ended in tears and pain. But my phone rang again. I quickly wiped the tears from my face and read the caller ID. I turned out to be my best friend. So I answered without knowing what @ CAPS1 wanted. @ CAPS1 asked if I wanted to go out and possibly have a bite to eat. His words cheered me up even though it was only half an inch. When @ CAPS1 entered my driveway, I was there waiting for him. I got into the passenger seat and @ CAPS1 immediately knew something was wrong. @ CAPS1 asked me if something had happened and I responded with a one-word response, "@ PERSON1". @ CAPS1 knew now was not a good time to talk about it, so we went to the nearest restaurant and found our seats. We both ordered coffee and I vigorously started tearing open the sugar packets and tossing them into my steaming cup of coffee. @ CAPS1 did the same, but with much less force. Then @ CAPS1 cautiously asked me if I wanted to talk about it. I looked up from the mess surrounding my coffee cup and slowly nodded. I began to quickly relate all the events of my day. Bringing a storm of profanity and profane language. My best friend just sat there and listened until my voice softened and my fists loosened. We sat there in silence for a short while as @ CAPS1 chose his words carefully. Then @ CAPS1 decided to change the subject for the moment because @ CAPS1 saw that I was still holding my car keys. @ CAPS1 asked how things were with my mom and another storm of curses came out of my mouth. We fell silent again, then @ CAPS1 asked me, " @ CAPS2 are you feeling better now that you got it all out ?" " I looked puzzled because it was not the answer I expected. After some thought, I answered yes. We then enjoyed our dinner, paid and left. My mood had improved, but I was still upset. So we drove to the river and got out of his claustrophobic car. @ CAPS1 and I walked down to the bank and stood there looking at the water. @ CAPS1 then asked me if I wanted to hear a joke, and after a pause I said yes. The @ CAPS1 joke told me it probably shouldn't be repeated, but it made me laugh so hard I was having trouble breathing. His timing was impeccable and he upped my mood. I always turned to my friends when I was feeling down. And they've always been there to prove that I can count on them. That day had been a disaster, but the rest of the night turned out to be much better than I had hoped for. It's not only that my friends can cheer me up, but it's also important that they make me laugh. Because if you are counting on someone to brighten up your day, what better way to @ CAPS2 makes them laugh. Laughter has always had an important meaning in my life. I laugh every day. Mainly because I find the silliest things hilarious. I know the laughter will never go away. I hope that someday, when I'm old and decrepit, all my wrinkles will be from the countless times I've had a few good laughs with my friends. Because laughter is magic. It can make a sad man happy, make the sun shine on a cloudy day, and shed light on darker situations.
Being around people who can still make you comfortable and be yourself is probably the best quality in a friend. Everyone has their faults; a friend can always look beyond them and find the right one in the one they trust. A friend can tell a joke and make you laugh until you cry. Making someone laugh can always help when they think their life can't get worse. Laughter is the most precious gift that can be given. You know inside that it makes them happy just by seeing the smile on their face. There have been many times in my life that I have laughed so much that I have cried. There really is no greater feeling in the world than knowing that you have people in your life who can cheer you up just by doing or even saying something so ridiculous it makes you laugh hysterically. . I laugh a lot throughout the day. When I don't, people get suspicious and they feel like something is wrong with me. This is literally how much of a role laughter plays in my life. Laughter is my second language in life. There has been one particular moment in my life so far that made me laugh so hard that I cried a lot. My friends were staying @ TIME1 at my house and we were just boys. We've done so many things that made us question our sanity : we ate hot sauce with a spoon, we watched comedy shows, and we ate ourselves sick too. It was the moment of a lifetime and we laughed through it all. Watching comedy shows we couldn't breathe. We laughed so hard! Nothing could stop me from laughing; I would keep replaying all the jokes in my head and start laughing more. I was already in so much pain as when we looked at it earlier. The actor was a magician of words; the way he put them all together seemed just like he was reading a sacred scroll from ancient times. I laughed and cried over and over again. I probably did this for ten minutes straight ! It was unbelievable. Making these lifelong memories with my friends is something I will never forget. I really know how much I have it in my life; people would kill to be in my place and to get the love and support I get from my friends and family. All of my experiences are the things that I learn, whether good or bad, I know this will all help me later in life to be able to make the right decision when presented to me. All the laughs I share with other people let me know that they had a great time throughout their day because they smiled and laughed with me. They also marked a point in my day. Being myself with them is also good because I know that they have already accepted me into their life and that I don't have to try to be someone else. Everyone laughs at one point or another in their life, no matter how much they deny it. I really don't know why they would, because what better feeling is there than being able to let out a little laugh every now and then? I really don't think there is. I really feel honored to have such amazing people in my life who always make it exciting and full of laughs and life. It shouldn't be any different in my opinion. Live life to the fullest; why would you want to experience it any other way?
It is always difficult to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or angry. Most of the time, you don't know what to do. I've learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better. While I was sitting at home on a sunny afternoon, I got a call from my friends @ PERSON1. When I put the phone to my ear, all I could hear was a loud scream. @ PERSON1 didn't say anything to me, not a word. Even though I asked her several times what was wrong with her, @ PERSON1 didn't even say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her, I asked her to calm down and take a deep breath. Desperately, I wanted her to be able to talk to me and tell me what was going on because I had started to really worry. A few minutes later @ PERSON1 started explaining to me what had happened. @ PERSON1 started by telling me that she was irresponsible for not paying attention to what was going on around her. I asked her why she was talking about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally @ PERSON1 yelled that while she was at home watching the basketball team @ CAPS1 play basketball her dog @ CAPS2 got run over. The dog was in fact dead. I found it very ridiculous and pathetic that @ PERSON1 is crying for his dog. I didn't mean to be rude about it and telling her what was going on upset me at the time. I even thought that was how I felt about the whole situation. I thought about the words I should say to @ PERSON1 but I was confused. In fact, it wasn't so much that I was confused, I was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words. Finally, I decided to tell him not to worry about his dog, that my friend had a few dogs to sell. Also, I told @ PERSON1 that if it made her feel better I would buy her a new puppy. After I told him that, there was an awkward silence. My hands started to shake because I thought @ PERSON1 was crazy. All of a sudden I heard her start to laugh very loudly and once again she couldn't speak. I felt so relieved that I had made him laugh and not cry or get mad at me. @ PERSON1 didn't close her mouth, she laughed and laughed and laughed hysterically. Finally, she closed her mouth and started talking to me again. @ PERSON1 thanked me for making him laugh and making a joke about the situation. Rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more. I was happy to make her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worse. As I laughed, I told her that whenever she needed to laugh, I was the person she needed to be called. Anytime, any day and anywhere I would be happy to bring a smile to her face and a big laugh to her mouth. @ PERSON1 laughed with me and thanks me again for making him laugh. Since that day, I always love making people laugh because I know I will make them feel better. I love it when other people make me laugh too. It's just an amazing feeling, a great feeling that everyone loves and can't really describe. After making my friend @ PERSON1 laugh, I discovered that laughter is a key part of life.
Laughter is an important part to have in life. Because without @ CAPS3 there would be no happiness or joy in the world. @ CAPS1 are a great source for laughter, @ CAPS1 are the people you are going to be yourself . Some people use laughter for releasing pain. For example, whenever @ CAPS10 father is injured, he starts laughing. @ CAPS10 @ CAPS2 was in the navy a few years ago. And during training he was hit in the stomach. Nothing was really wrong, but @ CAPS3 hurt him. so @ CAPS10 @ CAPS2 sat down and laughed. I guess what is called trait is inherited because I find myself doing the exact same thing every now and then. When I learned about how laughter heals, @ CAPS3 wasn't too long ago. @ CAPS3 Last @ DATE3, @ CAPS3 was at the start @ date5 and @ CAPS5 from @ date5 was near. Traditionally me and @ parents CAPS10 would lead to @ Organization1. And use the money we've saved all year and buy a huge bundle of fireworks. Once @ CAPS5 from @ date5 came I was overjoyed I woke up and immediately run up to @ mom CAPS10 and ask "@ @ CAPS3 from CAPS5 from @ date5 can I take the fireworks on the package now? " I was a new puppy explore his first chew toy. @ CAPS7 shook his head "@ CAPS6 again @ PERSON1, its only eleven in the morning." Sunset doesn't show up until seven or eight ”@ CAPS7 smiled at me. "Girl @ from CAPS8." @ CAPS7 whispered that @ CAPS7 left the room. Once the great golden sun finally went down and the smaller one appeared shimmering stars. We all knew @ CAPS3 was about time. "@ CAPS9 do you like to do the honors? " @ CAPS10 father gave me the first fireworks display and a lighter. A big smile appeared on the @ CAPS10 face without @ CAPS10 control. I loved the of lights fireworks, I love the bright colors look like they vomited in the newly lit sky, @ CAPS3 filled with colorful sparks sea. After @ CAPS5 from @ date5 had finished @ cousin CAPS10 @ CAPS12 came. @ Mom had CAPS10 was little sick, but @ CAPS3 was not something that was contagious. @ CAPS10 @ CAPS25 thought we were old enough to take care of ourselves and for @ CAPS10 mom. And @ DATE3 ended and I was wanted to see the @ CAPS13 movie with @ CAPS10 mom and @ CAPS12 so badly. @ Mom CAPS10 had a lot going wrong her doctor put her on several medications to relieve her problems. @ @ CAPS3 but seemed CAPS7 has a new doctor pill every week because the symptoms of each pill was at the origin of more and more problems. Its mid @ date5, @ DATE4, and still no sign of mom @ CAPS10 doing any better. @ CAPS12 and I took dog walks at the park near by, went for a swim, looked @ CAPS15, cleaned the cars, we'll try to find anything to do really. @ DATE1 came, and @ mom CAPS10 was showing signs of improvement @ CAPS7 walked more naturally. I called @ CAPS10 dad and asked if he thought going to see a movie was a good idea. he said to wait another day . I was worried about waiting another day because @ CAPS12 was going home the next day. The next day I woke up to the soft whisper of @ CAPS10 moms voice. "@ LOCATION1, @ PERSON1 wake honey up" @ @ CAPS7 shook CAPS10 shoulder. I opened @ CAPS10 eyes slowly, opening them wider than @ CAPS10 eyes focused on what was around me. "@ CAPS18 going to the movies? " @ @ CAPS7 shook CAPS10 shoulder again. "@ CAPS19, but your sick." I exhaled a heavy sigh. “I feel a lot better today. " @ Smiled CAPS7. “@ CAPS21 because the next screening is in twenty minutes. " The sudden rush @ CAPS21, woke me up. I then woke up @ CAPS12 and we soon then left. The movie was good. Subsequently, @ CAPS12 returned home and everything was silent once again, the rooms kept empty, the sun left, the house stood still. @ DATE2. this day is usually a time to relax. I was on @ CAPS10 computer most of the day, @ CAPS10 daddy was playing his video game. and @ CAPS10 mother was in the kitchen making dinner. @ Dad CAPS10 went to help his dinner. until @ CAPS7 almost had fallen with a few pans in his hands. @ CAPS10 Dad suggested that @ CAPS7 go for a nap or at least lay down. Later that evening @ CAPS10 father had found @ mother CAPS10. laying stiff, cold ... @ CAPS10 mother had passed away in her sleep that day . I felt like the @ heart of CAPS10 had exploded like fireworks. A few days passed, I was still standing on the sofa. I found solace in texting @ CAPS12. Tell him what the doctors told us . @ CAPS12 mentioned how ripped @ CAPS10 @ CAPS25 was on @ CAPS10 mom. And even though @ CAPS12 was harming on the inside, she and her @ @ CAPS2 PERSON2 tried to get @ @ CAPS10 CAPS25 and everyone laughing. Because they knew the laughter would be part of the pain go away. And I think they are amazing to find a little laughter in a dark place. This is why laughter is such an important part of life on.
Someone once said : " Laughter is the shortest distance between two people ." @ CAPS1, to me that means since everyone is laughing laughing is the fastest or easiest way to connect with another person. I believe so because at one point my older brother and I didn't get along very well. We were hardly ever together, and when we were, we argued or ignored each other. It wasn't much of a problem since he's five years older; but once I got older my brother and I started seeing each other more often. So we decided to sit down one day and talk. We weren't sure what to say; so for the first ten minutes, we sat there in silence. Just two guys on the back porch in the middle of @ TIME1. Then out of there he fell backwards into a bush. We both laughed harder than we've ever laughed in our lives. So @ CAPS1 when my family gets together there isn't a lot of arguing or fighting and we all sit down and tell stories and laugh. For my family and friends, laughter is one of the most important parts of a relationship because with laughter comes happiness, and with happiness comes love; and love is the most important component of life. So I say, “Laughter is the shortest distance between all people.
This true story may sound a bit cheesy, but it's true and in my opinion it's a love story. However, I will replace the real names with other names. On @ DATE1, after a long day at school, @ PERSON1 decided to connect to @ CAPS1-book to chat with new friends she had made online. @ PERSON1 forgot that she sent a friend's request to @ PERSON2. @ CAPS6 @ PERSON2 had accepted @ PERSON1's request this is when @ PERSON1 remembered the request. @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 started to learn more and more about the other minute after minute, @ CAPS9 before they had any idea who the other was. @ PERSON2 gave @ PERSON1 her number after the long chat, @ CAPS12 she could call or text him to keep in touch while being out of @ CAPS1-book. @ PERSON2 was starting to like @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS12 was @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 now knew that @ PERSON2 is a high school student, a sophomore to be exact. That he is @ NUM1 and that he also has some friends in common. @ PERSON1 @ CAPS4 really enjoyed talking to @ PERSON2. @ CAPS12 made @ PERSON2 to @ LOCATION1. @ PERSON1 noticed that @ PERSON2 liked to laugh a lot. I mean "a lot", @ PERSON1 @ CAPS4 liked it because it still made her day. @ PERSON2 knew that @ PERSON1 had recently broken up with her boyfriend. Anyway, @ PERSON2 didn't care, he @ CAPS4 liked @ PERSON1. He had a great hope @ CAPS4 that he might have a chance to make @ PERSON1 happy. @ CAPS12 ... he @ CAPS5 @ PERSON1 if she agreed to be his girlfriend. Without a doubt, she said ... "@ CAPS3 I would love to be your girlfriend". "@ CAPS4 would you do it?" @ CAPS5 @ PERSON2. "@ CAPS3 why wouldn't I? Replied @ PERSON1." @ CAPS6 Thought you wouldn't @ CAPS9 you recently got out of a relationship "@ PERSON2 replied. Start receiving texts from her ex-boyfriend. This started to affect @ PERSON1's relationship with @ PERSON2.But the problem was that @ PERSON1 was still in love with @ PERSON3. @ PERSON2 knew it for one. But it didn't stop @ PERSON2 to fight to get @ CAPS7 from @ LOCATION1. @ PERSON1 is the kind of girl who doesn't like to hide anything from her boyfriend. @ CAPS12 one night while @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 were talking on the phone, @ PERSON2 decided to ask @ PERSON1 if she was willing to try to forget her ex. @ PERSON1 was afraid to answer the question but she had to be honest and said ... "@ CAPS8 @ PERSON2 I will try but I don't promise anything." @ CAPS9 @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 have good communication @ CAPS4 when laughter is involved, @ PERSON1 has changed the subject and @ CAPS5 @ PERSON2 if he was ready to ui be of service. Of course @ PERSON2 said "@ CAPS3". The favor @ PERSON1 had @ CAPS5 @ PERSON2 for was if he could laugh for her. "@ CAPS11 !" @ PERSON2 laughed. “@ CAPS12 can you do me this favor ? @ PERSON1 @ CAPS5.” @ CAPS3, @ CAPS11 ! @ PERSON2 laughed again. Who would have thought that laughter in a relationship could make it so much better @ CAPS12. @ CAPS3, that wouldn't make it perfect or exactly the way you want it to be, but it's definitely a lot better than fighting @ NUM2 for things that are just plain stupid and unnecessary. I believe that laughter plays a great role in any type of relationship. It is as if laughter is a language we can all understand to communicate with each other. @ CAPS6 Hope you liked my true story about how laughter plays such a big part in all relationships.
My relationship to laughter. Well the first time I found myself face to face with laughter was when I first met my boyfriend. Before I met him, I was depressed all the time and my friends couldn't take it anymore. But when my friends introduced me to him I fell in love for the first time I was happy for once not depressed and all alone in a corner crying all the time. When it first happened in almost a year, I smiled, I didn't smile until the day I met him. It was then that my friends knew I had found someone to take care of me and love me for who I am. Later in the relationship, that's where the laughter came in. I laughed all the time when I was with him and didn't get angry all the time. That's when we started hanging out, but it took all of our friends to hang out. After saying to go out, we got to know each other better than we did at the start when we first met. It took us until the first year to start dating. That's when I found out I was able to date someone else and not him, I didn't believe it at first until this guy came over to me and starts to scream. He came up to me and comforted me in front of my friends and said "@ CAPS1 is @ CAPS3 cheating on me and it's over ?" with a guy @ CAPS3 just met. Then he tried to tell me it was over and I said "We were never dating in the first place!" My friends approached me and saw me in tears and asked me what was wrong and tried to find someone new for me. By the time @ CAPS4 did this I was with another guy and am happy with him and nothing can change that he will always be there for me and no matter what happens between us. He's the best thing that ever happened to me and he makes me laugh when I'm upset or angry, he says "don't worry, everything will be fine, I promise you so believe in me". Laughter has been in this relationship for almost a year now, so we have no plans to change that, unless one of us got it wrong again, we screwed up so much we don't know what To do. If it goes now I don't know what I'm going to do it's part of my life and the relationship now lets see if we can keep it together without ruining this time around. This part of my relationship is the best and it won't change, at least I hope it doesn't change because it would cause me to start living again in fear of my stepfather. I'm glad I found someone. I hope that won't change because laughter is what comes with him and when I'm with him he makes me laugh and no one has ever been able to make me laugh when I wasn't even crying my friends and family. Now that the laughter is there most of the time, I can't wait for the day that sorrow goes out the window. So now that me and him are together and happy and I hope nothing goes wrong between us because of how much we love each other and I'm not bubbly myself when he's not around. Six at @ CAPS2 of my friends say "@ CAPS3 is losing your bubbly self, don't let her disappear on @ CAPS3, she's here to guide @ CAPS3 down the road." @ CAPS4 also told my dad that I don't really hang out with them anymore and the reason @ CAPS1 I don't is because @ CAPS4 can be bossy and @ CAPS4 tells me what I can and can't do . Can't @ CAPS1 just figure out that this relationship won't work if @ CAPS4 keeps messing around @ CAPS4 all think my life revolves around them and they don't. My relationship with laughter has nothing to do with my friends and family, it has to do with my boyfriend and me and it's @ CAPS1 I told @ CAPS3 about my relationship with laughter. Let's just say my relationship with laughter will always be there and nothing will change it, not even my parents or parents, we can promise so much @ CAPS3. Can't @ CAPS1 make this relationship end well without someone or anything trying to interfere ? I just wish there was a world that @ CAPS3 could escape to without anyone knowing where in the world they are. Well, just to say that nothing can make this relationship deteriorate unless we start fighting with each other again. I hope nothing will separate us and if it does, who knows what will happen.
" Laughter " I heard a man say once " Laughter is the key to happiness, and if you don't laugh you're not healthy " @ CAPS1 Do people like to laugh ? Because laughing creates beautiful memories, it drives away sadness, it gives energy, and it even gives a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long. There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard that you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is still sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny. I bet laughing or making someone else laugh might get you hired. Suppose you show up for an interview for a job that requires you to work with people every day. Are you going to go boring and moditone? No, you're going to go make the person interviewing you laugh and pretend you've known them from @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. Laughter can also be abused. It can be misused, like making fun of people because @ MONTH1 is funny. Call kids in your gym class names because they can't throw a baseball as far as you can. Laughing @ MONTH1 makes people feel as bright as the stars at night, or @ MONTH1 makes people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer to win the championship game. Be careful when using it, treat it like a loaded weapon, because if you misuse it, it may hurt someone. A few hours after the death of my @ CAPS4. My family and I started talking about all the great memories we had with her when she was with us. I noticed that tears were streaming down the cheeks of my @ CAPS5 @ PERSON1. We then suddenly started talking about all the times she would go crazy and curse my dad when he was a little boy, and then get embarrassed because she knew she should never have said the Lord's name in vain. After thinking back to those times, we started to laugh, and not just an imperceptible little laugh, I mean we were laughing out loud. He then let go of that painful sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that night would become such a moving memory later in life.
Laughter is important in my life for many reasons. Seriously, my life wouldn't be as great as it is right now. I have a lot of people in my life who make laughter the best way to brighten up my day such as my friends, family and boyfriend. I have a lot of stories where laughter was a part of my life, but I'm going to tell you a story about how my boyfriend used laughter to make me feel better and not think about my stomach ache . It all happened a @ DATE1 @ TIME1 @ CAPS1 I was coming home from my boyfriend's house. We were seated as much as possible and I started to have a stomach ache. I told my boyfriend about it and he told me it was probably because I hadn't eaten anything. I was worried because it was going to be a long trip home. On our trip home, my boyfriend was trying to distract me so that I didn't worry too much about my stomach ache. He started talking to me and telling me about my day at school and I told him my day was good, not bad. We started talking for a while, until my boyfriend took off his hat and said " flat to volume !" "@ CAPS1 my boyfriend takes off his hat and says I burst out laughing ! I was laughing so hard that instead of having a stomach ache because I hadn't eaten all day, I was in pain from the strength and strength of laughing. I was laughing so much because my boyfriend's hair was so messy. Her hair looked so funny! As I tried not to laugh, I asked my boyfriend why his hair was like this. He started telling me that @ CAPS1 he was taking a shower, he grabbed a shampoo bottle that said flat to volume and he didn't know his hair was going to have that much volume. All the way back, I couldn't stop laughing at my boyfriend's hair. I found it so funny that I forgot about my stomach ache. To this day, I still laugh at my boyfriend's hair and how it looked that day. Now we have a joke inside and every time I remember that day I tell her "flat to volume" and we both start to laugh. Now I know laughter is the best medicine for me @ CAPS1 My stomach hurts. Laughter will always be a part of me and my life no matter what!
Have you ever wondered how you and your best friends became friends? Maybe not, but maybe you remembered it and you don't remember it. Well this story I'm about to tell you today is about how my friend @ PERSON3 and I became friends. I will also tell you how we have been friends for as long as we are and all the little things that have kept us friends. Granted, we didn't start out as friends who laughed all the time, but rather as a town crier and helper. @ PERSON3 and I first met in eighth grade. I had just been called out of my first term class and greeted by my math teacher @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 told me that we had just welcomed a new student who moved here from @ LOCATION1 and that he was not really happy with it. She also asked if I wouldn't mind showing her around the school with another classmate, @ PERSON4, I agreed and walked into the room where @ PERSON3 was. When I saw her, the first thing I noticed were her eyes, as tears ran down her face. Then I realized she was a very pretty girl who as @ PERSON1 said was not happy. Granted, I was a little scared to try and show her around as she was not at all happy to be here. But once we started she had calmed down immensely, but she still wasn't even smiling at our faint temptations to joke. I still felt like she should be happy and pulled out the big guns. So I walked differently and spoke in a funny voice, even started saying random funny things in long pauses. Finally, she smiled, so I continued. Towards the end I made him laugh with @ PERSON4 so hard we almost all got wet. But as funny as it was to us, it sure wasn't the last funny thing we did. You know the kind of funny things that happen and no matter what, you always remember it when you see this person that it happened with, right ? To say the least @ PERSON3 and I have a lot of those moments. Granted, a lot of them happen with other people, but that's what makes it fun. Like this time in our drawing and painting class, we, @ PERSON3, @ LOCATION2, and @ CAPS1 and I were all in @ PERSON2's small office taking a picture to draw. I had been hyper pretty much all day and @ CAPS3 too. I look randomly around the room and see a really cute poster that I had never noticed before and without realizing it I said out loud, "@ CAPS2, this is really cute." @ CAPS3 started to laugh and stand at the desk to avoid falling to the floor. I still didn't realize I said it out loud and I was really confused but I still laughed because watching them laugh was really fun. They finally calmed down long enough to say what I had just said and I blushed but started to laugh. Now every time they see me and remember this moment they burst out laughing and they point to something and say it like I said. That's why I think having fond memories of the really funny thing kept us together. It helps us remember the fun times during the bad times. It also helps to keep our bond strong in the group of our friends. But the little things matter too. Every little thing we do together as friends helps us later. If we weren't doing all the funny little things and just doing big fun things or boring things, I don't think our friendship would last long. Like when we talk and accidentally burp or fart while walking. Or maybe when I laugh and hide my face with my hands and arms shake. Maybe even when we say something weird or walk funny because we really have to go to the bathroom. It's not just being friends that keeps us together it's how we are and who we become with this other person, I feel like I'm becoming a better person and I believe I'm helping to become so too. Plus, the little things are just as fun as the big things we do. So, like I said before, laughter is a big part of a friendship. @ PERSON3 and my friendship didn't start with laughs, it started with tears and turned into laughs. The laughter had brought us together in a strange act and it has remained very strong ever since, not only because we had a lot in common, to be frank, we don't even have much in common, it's because of the big hilarious moments that we shared not only together but with other people and the little things that we do on a daily basis that we find really fun. I have to say that laughter is probably the best thing to keep a good and healthy relationship.
There are a few things that can make strangers feel comfortable with each other, in my experience it was laughter. Meeting my boyfriend's parents was very nerve-racking and uncomfortable. I am a sociable person and I can get along with anyone. Striking up a conversation with someone who judges my every move was a bit of a challenge. My boyfriend @ PERSON3 and I have been dating for almost a year now and are the type of people who enjoy spending time with our families. So because of that it was obvious that meeting the family would come into play. I met his parents when we were young and we went to the last years of elementary and part of college and all but one year of. high school together, I left a few years and came back really different. So after @ NUM1 months of dating, I met people. One day at @ DATE1 @ PERSON3 had a soccer game I attended with some girlfriends who were also dating guys from the team. After a terrible loss, @ PERSON3 came out of the locker room and gave me a hug and told me it was time to meet the parents. I took a deep breath and started to get really nervous. I love meeting new people and I usually don't have a problem with that, but the fact that I wanted her parents to love me really weighed on me. I walked slowly after him and said "@ CAPS3" in my friendliest voice possible. Her mom reached out and said "@ CAPS1 @ PERSON1, I'm @ CAPS2" I took her hand and squeezed it and said "@ CAPS3, nice to meet you". I looked @ ORGANIZATION1 for reassurance then her dad reached out with a very welcoming smile and his eyes looked so familiar and warm. "@ CAPS4 there, I'm @ PERSON2", I shook his hand and felt less nervous and a little at ease. “@ CAPS1, nice to meet you, what did you think of the game? '. He seemed surprised that I spoke and we started a great conversation about football. After talking about football for about @ NUM2 or @ NUM3 minutes @ PERSON3 brought up something that reminded me of a joke. I always have lame jokes so I was nervous about telling them to his parents. It wasn't even a funny joke , @ PERSON3 thought it was lame, but I liked it. I took the risk anyway. I said "@ CAPS4 that reminds me of a joke", @ PERSON3 looked at me with wide eyes that Said oh my god don't. hot here, over there the other one screamed, fuck shit ! talking muffin. I started to laugh and my laugh is very strange. Everyone I meet tell me laughter is so unique. Her mom was like "this is adorable I'm going to have to tell @ CAPS6", I smiled gratefully. Her dad @ PERSON2 said so sweetly "I love your laugh re, I have not heard of such ". @ PERSON3 walked in and said "yes his laugh is really something". We all smiled a little at each other and went to dinner, making jokes and laughing and then laughing at my laughter. Thank goodness for laughing, once we started laughing I felt comfortable and welcome. Until this day, we laugh at me telling this joke. I am still happy to this day for having told the joke.
On @ DATE1 I had a mission meeting at @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION1 at @ NUM1 hours in @ TIME1. @ CAPS11 friend @ PERSON2 decided he would go with me. So I asked @ CAPS11 grandpa to come pick us up from the house and take us to @ LOCATION2. When we got to church I went to the meeting from @ CAPS11 until @ NUM2 hours, then I went to study the Bible. I was tired and ready to go home by this time. Come and realize that @ CAPS11 grandpa knows where to be he apparently left to come home and @ CAPS11 mom, grandma and @ CAPS11 sister @ CAPS3 had just arrived to pick us up. I had just been informed that there was a parent meeting for students going on a mission trip. After the meeting, we went to the craft store @ PERSON1. When we got there @ PERSON2 and I went to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, while @ CAPS11 mom, grandma and @ CAPS3 stayed at @ LOCATION3. I bought me and @ CAPS11 mom a pair of comfy slippers. then we went back to @ PERSON1 to brag about slippers to @ CAPS11 mom and grandma. It was a bad idea, grandma @ CAPS11 decided she needed a pair for herself so she headed over to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. It was taking forever. I told her if she stopped looking at stuff we would go to @ CAPS6, get a sandwhich and come back. So we did. When we got to @ CAPS6, @ PERSON2 was in a bad mood because he was ready to go home. We ordered our sandwhichs and headed back to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. She eventually found herself a pair of slippers, after searching for an hour and a half. Everyone gets in the car, and we think we're going home when suddenly grandma screams "I was going to @ LOCATION5, I want a bowl of chili". Our reaction was "@ CAPS10, @ CAPS11 gosh". We couldn't let her go hungry, so we had to stop. after getting her chili she says "I have to get into @ ORGANIZATION1", @ CAPS10 boy was that a mistake. We were in @ ORGANIZATION1 forever in one day. After we got back in @ ORGANIZATION1's car, I sat in the backseat in the middle of @ CAPS3 and @ ORGANIZATION2. I told @ PERSON2 to remember to show @ CAPS11 mom an important mail he received when we got home, and his response was "@ CAPS10 ya! If we ever get home ". All I could do was laugh. I was filmed by @ PERSON2 and @ CAPS11 mom kept looking at me to see if I was okay. I couldn't stop laughing. I laughed so much I cried, I lost all of @ CAPS11's breath and @ CAPS11's face was as red as a cherry. I laughed continuously from @ ORGANIZATION1 to @ LOCATION4 road. When I finally fell asleep.
Laughter makes you live longer. That's what I was told as a child. I think laughter is really important in life. And, in relationships. In my relationship with my sister @ LOCATION1, we laugh all day, every day. And I think that's why we have the most fun together. I laugh the most when I'm with my friends. I remember a time when I was with @ PERSON2 and we were laughing so much for nothing it's something we do a lot. I'm just a laughing person. Everyone knows it. I think when I laugh, it takes everything that's wrong right now, and none of it matters. I have this friend named @ PERSON3, and he was the kind of person who made me laugh no matter what mood I was in. So because of that he will always be an important person in my life. Once @ PERSON2 and I were with this girl who was very quiet for some reason when she was with us, and I just told her she needed to talk or laugh ! or something. Then she opened up and really laughed at the funny things. See, if you're with a group of friends or people you're affiliated with, it's not okay to just sit there and not say or do anything, just be yourself. Laugh at things that you find funny even if others don't laugh about it. We do not care. Be you. I love, I absolutely love when babies laugh. When a baby laughs, to me that means the baby is going to be a happy human. In movies and TV shows I sometimes laugh. I just feel like if you laugh your life will be a lot easier than just looking at the negative things. Just be happy and laugh every now and then. One time my sister and I @ PERSON2 stole a truck, well .. we asked the guy if we could use his truck for something and he said yes, but we really didn't use him for anything. either .. We just wanted to drive. And, when we started driving, we were going so fast and playing loud music. It was hilarious, and now every time we listen to that song we blow up, we burst out laughing. So when you create great memories and later in life think about the memories, or they are elevated somehow. It's fun to just sit there and remember. I could tell you a thousand stories. Here is one. Once @ PERSON2 and I were living with our good friend @ PERSON1, and we were under his table pretending to be in a spaceship, it was so, so, so, so much fun ! I will never forget that time. And even when I write this, I still laugh at these stories. One time my sister @ PERSON2 and I was skating downtown and was trying to do this lap, I think it was a really good turnaround ? Anyway, I tried to do it and I fell on my butt. It hurt, but it was hilarious. And now every time we walk past this place where I fell, we laugh about it. Memories are fun, every memory I have I laugh when I remember. Once me and @ PERSON2 were hanging out with some nice people, then we left and went to this girls house, and there we turned the music up all the way and danced for about an hour, we have a video of it. It was really funny. In the video, I mostly laugh.
@ CAPS1 .., it's a sound that I love to hear, to laugh. Laughter plays a big role in my life. For me, it's the only thing that can keep me going. Sometimes it's even better than ice cream, and that says a lot. I have had a lot of different experiences in life of which laughter has been a big part. Like @ CAPS6, my brother was sent back to jail. @ CAPS6 I was @ CAPS5 I had to laugh because that was the only thing that made me feel good inside. Plus @ CAPS6 got thrown out like trash last night the laughs made me feel like nothing had happened. So the folks at @ CAPS6 are not feeling well or going through some hardship in their life, I really believe that laughing will make everything a little better. @ CAPS2! "Hit me like a brick in the head. Hearing that my brother was put back in jail was a hard thing to hear. He had just come out of a four month sentence, three months ago . One of the hardest things thinks what to say @ CAPS6 his three year old son, @ PERSON1, asks “@ CAPS3's @ CAPS4 ?” The main reason I am not as scared for my brother as I am was is because of my nephew @ PERSON1. He can light up any situation with his adorable laugh. So every time my brother gets sent back to jail I know it will be okay @ CAPS6 I see a big smile on @ PERSON1's chubby little face. He is my inspiration to smile @ CAPS6 I feel like there is absolutely nothing in that word to smile or laugh. Even @ CAPS6, we were both sitting in the emergency room he was still laughing. Being @ CAPS5 is the worst thing in the world for me. I hate not being able to get out of bed and go somewhere. All I usually do is go outside with my friends, but @ CAPS6 I'm @ CAPS5 I can't do anything. The only thing I can really do is take nasty medicine. Recently I was in the hospital with very severe abdominal pain. Then not even two weeks later, I was back in the emergency room with strep throat. I had a lot of pain for about four weeks in all. one thing i hate more than being @ CAPS5 is that people feel bad for me for being @ CAPS5. So whenever I'm @ CAPS5 I always make jokes and make people laugh no matter how much it hurts to laugh. Even though laughing didn't do me any good physically, it certainly made me feel a lot better emotionally. Laughter is like my brand of medicine for @ CAPS6 I'm not feeling well. It seems to make me feel better faster than any over the counter medicine. Especially for breaking up with my first "love". "I don't want my mistakes to hurt you anymore" was the last thing he said to me. My first "love" left me alone on a staircase to drown in my own tears. It was my first real breakup. I was having enough trouble dealing with it. Then the day after we broke up, my friends came to get me. They told me I needed to be reassembled. @ CAPS6 we arrived in town, we stopped at the store. My friend @ PERSON3 told me to choose a half gallon of ice cream, so I had mint chocolate chips. We finally got to @ PERSON3 and he told me I had to eat the whole half gallon of ice cream for myself. Of course, I did not discuss. While I was eating the ice cream he and my friend @ PERSON2 did a little skit about how they were going to be my ex boyfriend. I was laughing so hard that my brain froze. At the end of the sketch, I was rolling on the floor laughing. All the laughs made me forget I was sad in the first place. I felt that just having a good laugh with my friends brought us closer together. While I was with my ex, we never hung out because I was always with him. I had a blast that day and will remember it forever. Laughter is really the key to living a good life. "@ CAPS6 life gives you lemons make lemonade" is a quote I chose to listen to and try to follow. For me the quote just says enjoy the little things in life. So every time I laugh, I am enjoying a little bit of the fun in life. Laughing is a part of my life no matter how difficult @ MONTH1 life seems. So even though my brother is in jail I'm @ CAPS5, or just got dumped ; I laugh so I don't have to worry anymore. Laughter is a main ingredient in everyone's life, remember that or life won't turn out the way everyone wants it to. "
To laugh. We all need it. We need this @ CAPS8 a reminder that @ CAPS7 is a hope for those who have perseverance, for those who strive not to improve others, but for those who strive to improve themselves. We need it @ CAPS8 a reminder to live our dreams, instead of dreaming to live. And, in my opinion, most importantly, @ CAPS8 a reminder that even if we @ MONTH1 make mistakes, @ CAPS7 is still an opportunity for those who just have the courage to grab it. At @ DATE1, my adoptive parents decided to go out for dinner. Children, of course, were not invited. We either had to stay at home with the babysitter or go to a friend's house. No one wanted to stay home, @ CAPS8 @ CAPS7 had nothing to do. One of my best friends, @ PERSON2, was a single child living with her grandmother. I made a quick phone call and ten minutes later I was waiting for her grandmother to pick me up. It was about five o'clock in @ TIME1, and I had to be back by nine o'clock at the latest. I had four hours and it was two weeks before @ CAPS1. None of us knew @ CAPS13 to do with so much free time. After all, we only saw each other for a few hours at school. This new way for both of us. We were both in second grade and I had a crush on @ LOCATION1. This turned out to be a big deal, given that @ CAPS6 knew this information. @ CAPS6 didn't have a problem with that, but @ PERSON1 her boyfriend did. We got along, but he didn't like that I spent so much time with her, especially when he wasn't @ CAPS7. He trusted me to take care of her, so he didn't do much with it. We decided to first configure the @ CAPS1 tree and switch from @ CAPS7. We both had @ CAPS3, so pretty much everything on the tree was brilliant. Garlands, ornaments, pictures, @ CAPS14 name it. It took about twenty minutes to put everything in place, not to mention the time it took to unpack all the decorations. It was beautiful when we finished. I would help make some pretty trees @ CAPS12, but this was by far the best. I was proud of our work. I didn't have much to enjoy in my life, so it was one of those things that normally wouldn't matter, but suddenly became very important. We admired our work for a few minutes and then went down to the den. @ PERSON2 went on @ CAPS4 to talk to @ PERSON1 a bit while texting my girlfriend. I was preparing to break up with her. @ PERSON3 and I had been together for most of my sophomore year and was starting to regret it. Our relationship started when one of my buddies, @ PERSON4, and his ended. I know it sounds bad, but I really didn't want to be with her at first. I put myself between @ PERSON4 and her so that they would stop fighting so much. Now I was starting to understand why he broke up with her in the first place. @ CAPS6 was like a bad drug that made @ CAPS14 go really high, then dropped @ CAPS14 like a rock. @ CAPS6 was extremely controlling. @ CAPS6 was not @ CAPS12 for me, and @ PERSON2 finally convinced me that was enough. After breaking up with @ PERSON3, I felt both happy and depressed. I was happy that I could be free, but I was depressed because I felt so lonely. I had never been @ CAPS12 to connect with people so it was hard for me to do that. Seeing me so roughed up wasn't right for @ PERSON2. @ CAPS6 knew me a lot better than most people, so @ CAPS6 knew I needed help fast. @ CAPS6 did something so subtle that to most it would have seemed unimportant. @ CAPS6 glanced at me, got up from the computer and gave me a long hug. At first I didn't think this was an idea from @ CAPS12. Her boyfriend was very protective of @ PERSON2. He didn't like guys to come near her, under any circumstances. "@ CAPS5 @ CAPS14 please just try to relax for a minute? You're making me nervous." @ CAPS6 said in this tone that it meant it was more of an order than a question. Maybe it was because I was in such a bad mood that it struck me as the funniest thing in the world. I started to laugh very loudly. "@ CAPS7. It wasn't that hard, was it ?" @ CAPS8 @ CAPS6 walked away from the hug, I kissed the forehead; our way of saying "your beautiful". "@ CAPS9 @ CAPS14 are you going?" @ CAPS6 asked in a worried voice. "@ CAPS11, you will be fine. Thank you @ PERSON2." "@ CAPS12. @ CAPS14 never showed me that guitar thing." “@ CAPS13 guitar thing ?” “@ CAPS14 said @ CAPS14 played guitar.” @ CAPS15 then I realized I might never have another friend @ CAPS8 @ CAPS12 @ CAPS8 this one. "@ CAPS16 @ CAPS11. Come on. I'll show @ CAPS14 how to play @ CAPS17 man."
As people bonded over the years, those bonds were strengthened with laughter, joy, and trust. All of these are important, but they all work together to make these connections. In order for normal people to appreciate each other, they need to have fun, and the fun begins with laughter. Laughter comes from the brain and if two people think the same as being funny, it brings them closer to their similar interests. By telling a funny joke or being a person who always ends with a smile, we bring people together more easily. Since I was young, I have always been a very happy child and easy to be around. I think I'm like that because my parents always told me, "People who are happy are who people want to be." @ CAPS1 being a seemingly happy person gave me the friends I have. Although I never really understood what it means because it could mean a lot of different things. Whenever I'm with my friends, now thinking about it, we're always laughing or joking about something. We could laugh at ourselves, or we could laugh at a random person on the street. We could absolutely do nothing and laugh at something stupid, while having a good time. It's @ MONTH1 starting an argument which is funny to us. If someone starts saying stupid things, then one of us will jump at the chance to make them sound as stupid as possible. Most of the time it won't hurt our buttocks, but most of the time we will go too far. With all the laughs we shared before they kept us friends. Stupidity and pain are probably the two main reasons we laugh. The stupidity would be if someone said something that didn't make sense or happened at the wrong time. I never understood why we laugh at the pain, maybe it is because we are happy that it is not us who are suffering, although sometimes it is, but maybe it is because that we know they will get over it. When someone is badly hurt and another person laughs a lot, I see them get angry because they are laughed at for their pain. They just need to realize that it's funny for people to get hurt and know that they laugh about it too. Laughter will always bring people to relationships. It shows common interests and what people can tolerate from others. Laughter is the main element in bringing happiness to people's lives, without happiness and laughter, this world would be a boring supper.
Laughter is a mystery. It happens to @ CAPS2 as it sees fit. He puts smiles on their faces. Laughter occurs in several possible ways. Although mine ended up in a crazy situation with a huge mess to keep up with. Things have become extreme, unforgettable. Things you could never forget. About two months ago, in the cold @ DATE1. It was my birthday @ NUM1. I threw a little party for me at home. However, I was in for a little treat. @ CAPS2 everyone arrived they all had a smirk on their faces. No one wanted to tell me what was going on. I started to be upset by all of this. Until my buddy @ PERSON3 and my boyfriend @ PERSON1 walked into the kitchen with a pail of @ NUM1 pound full of spaghetti, along with a ten gallon can of tomato sauce. The next thing I knew my mouth was gaping. I couldn't believe my eyes, not understanding why so much. Also, why did they have it. My mom came out and exclaimed "@ CAPS1 get the cars up and go !" @ CAPS2 we approached @ ORGANIZATION1, I had a funny feeling in the pit of my guts. I looked around and noticed that my sister-in-law was holding a video camera. At that point, I knew something was going to happen. Something big, extraordinary, out of the extreme and I was right. Spaghetti was flying everywhere, penetrating people's hair, faces. The clothes were stained and dirty. Not to mention it was cold, wet and rainy outside. The fog made it difficult to see who you were hitting and who was throwing it at you. By the end of the Noodle War I looked worse. Even now the shoes I was wearing are stained. @ CAPS2 we went home, we had to wash with the hose. I swore I was going to get sick from the cold water running down my face. I could feel noodles falling from my hair and clothes, the sauce steaming on my face. Laugh here and laugh there. Everyone laughed at the others how covered in noodles and gravy they were. Finally, we all got hungry. We opted for nachos. So my mom poured two family size nacho chips on the table, followed by two ten gallon cans of nacho cheese with jalapenos, olvis. You @ MONTH1 think the noodles and gravy was messy, well that's where I went wrong. My friend @ CAPS3 dropped some nachos on my couch. @ PERSON3 threw nacho cheese at @ LOCATION1, she threw crisps at @ ORGANIZATION2. @ PERSON3 threw cheese at me and ended up on my dog. Let's just say my living room was a cheese party. I couldn't believe the nacho cheese got stuck in my dogs and all of the girls' hair. Crumbs of crisps were in the couch and the cheese was on the floor and the tree @ CAPS4. So @ PERSON3 finally said "@ CAPS5 more nachos!" @ CAPS6 it was cake time. Ginger thought there wouldn't be another mess. Well, again, she was wrong. They all started to sing the happy birthday song, the cameras were flashing, my mom was crying in the background. She cries on our birthdays because she says it's barely a year since her children are moving. I thought she would get used to it knowing that she had already moved two children. All of a sudden there was icing on my face! I rubbed the frosting and smeared it all over @ PERSON1's face. Although he just rubbed it on mine. My mother grabbed a plate and threw it on @ LOCATION2, she threw it on @ CAPS3 then @ ORGANIZATION2 and @ PERSON3 then @ PERSON2. Chocolate frosting was all over the place with the nacho cheese. Soon after, we were playing video games. Of course me being me, I played @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 @ NUM3 live on @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11. I got mad at someone on the game and ended up throwing the controller on my TV and smashing it. My mom wasn't very happy with me after that. Well, we still got to watch movies in the other room. Eventually people started to leave. Say goodbye, see you soon @ CAPS6, peace man. We have said it all. I looked back into the living room and said nothing more than a huge mess of fries, nachos and cake. Not to mention my broken TV, I got stuck cleaning up the mess for over three hours. However, we laughed the whole time this happened. Have the best time ever with each other. If I could I would go back and do it again just for fun and laughs. Laughter is everywhere. You @ MONTH1 don't see it right away. Although you did @ CAPS2 you started to laugh at yourself. Laughing puts everyone in a good mood and makes faces smile. He @ MOIS1 also does damage and puts things in a crazy situation. You can't deny after these crazy situations that you would go back and do it again. Laughter is the biggest thing in this world we call @ LOCATION3.
Laughter @ PERSON1 Laughter has many advantages that can make us have more distance between two people or maybe make us have differences between the relationships you have with people. But a lot of other people believe and (think) that laughter is an important part of any relationship with your friends, family, etc. Now, I'm going to talk about a few reasons why laughter can be of benefit to us, and how it can distance us from people as well, or how laughter works between the relationships we have with friends. A lot of people think it's really fun to laugh at simple things and that's me, I can laugh at things that may not seem like fun to other people, but to me they can seem extremely funny. I won't stop laughing for a while. But a lot of other people don't see laughter as funny, like a lot of others. I believe laughter is an important part of us because it shows the people around you how you are and how you express yourself on things. Many of your friends or even family will know what type of person you are and how stupid you can get at times. This is the reason why I think this is a great idea or (thing) to do, just have fun and laugh. Now let's talk about relationships between people. Do you think laughter can be an important part of any relationship or how could it help us (in ways) ????? Well yeah, I think laughter can be hugely important in a lot of the relationships we have with people. You get to know yourself and others get to know you and what you are like. Even if many relationships we have with our friends, our family or with new people we meet. I believe laughter tells you what a person is like and how that person reacts to what other people do or tell them. Laughter expresses what that person is like and how fun they are to be around. Laughter even tells you if that person has a lot of humor, just a little, or no humor at all. When people don't have a lot of humor, they really don't get and understand the funny parts of a joke or whatever. I also think that laughter is really important for any kind of relationship you have with someone because it allows you to get to know that person better. But other people see laughter as a reason that pulls two people away from each other. I don't consider laughter to be a reason for people to distance themselves from each other. The reasons I think and say this is because there are a lot of people who are laughing a lot almost crying and they don't have distances from each other or anything. They might have more friends or more people to talk to them because other people might also see how that person is doing and they might see that it is really fun to be with them. I know this because I laugh a lot and it hasn't happened to me. This is why I do not consider and do not believe that laughter is the reason for having distances between people (relationship). In my opinion, I consider laughter to be a very important part of who we are, how we think and also the things we love to do. What I mean by that is you can have a little humor, but you're not actually expressing the way you think about what other people are doing. Or if something is super silly and it's a new kid in school and you or someone else says something, you might probably think it's funny, but you don't. you might not want to laugh at this time because you @ MOIS1 are a little shy or just because you might not know this person as well and maybe the other person will not have confidence enough to laugh with you at any nonsense someone just said. Although a lot of people should still laugh when they want to. Sometimes if you laugh a lot you could be the happiest, funniest person in the world. Or whenever someone is sad, you might as well be the one person who can make them laugh and make them happy. Also, these are some of the reasons why I think laughter is good for you, that way people will get to know you better. These are a few reasons why laughter can be an advantage, how it can keep people away.
There are times when I get along with others and others don't. There are also times when I make others laugh until they cry. As this time around my friends and I were walking towards the store, I start to point out the more random things. When I reported the @ CAPS1 store, he started laughing so hard he literally peed his pants. So we had to go home so he could change into a clean rag, and it took @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 minutes to get dressed. So I asked @ CAPS6 what he was doing in there, and he said. "I'm peeing." @ CAPS2 I started laughing and rolling on the floor, and that's when I understood why he was laughing so hard at me pointing to the @ CAPS1 store. It was because the last time we got inside there was a man talking about his son's soccer team that my friend and I were in at the time was in the top ten. . Guss @ CAPS6, we really weren't. The man was so scared of @ CAPS6 that the lady he was talking to might think of him. So @ CAPS5 gets up and tells us. "@ CAPS4 you for letting me know. I thought he was right for a second." @ CAPS5 gives us a hug and the man gets up and says. "@ CAPS6 about me? How come I don't get a hug." That's when I started laughing louder @ devil CAPS2. Fortunately, I didn't have to go to the bathroom.
@ CAPS4 fills the air around us with happiness and joy, @ CAPS4 brings warm memories of our loved ones and adds a touch of hope to those in need of @ CAPS4. Laughter is the key to solving life's problems. @ CAPS4 is a way to add something special to our life and comes from many different areas of life. Laughter might be from a pitiful joke someone might have told you, @ CAPS4 might be conjured up on a show, and @ CAPS4 might also be from the joy we feel when a loved one returns home after a long trip. . Imagine seeing something comical like a person falling or crashing into a pole, the moment this happens you can hear yourself laughing as hard as you can, you barely can breathe and the person standing just outside. next to you joins in the laughter. . Although @ CAPS3 might seem rude and disrespectful, you have just bonded with the person next to you and found a similarity between the two of you. @ CAPS3 is the way friendships are created and formed, just one little thing that made you laugh and bonding with each other can spark a whole new friendship between people that can last a minute or a lifetime. . In my case @ CAPS3 is how I met one of my closest friends, we had seen a student in our class trying to show the class how cool he was by climbing up the pole. flag and replacing the @ ORGANIZATION1 state flag with its own personal flag. homemade flag (he got the @ CAPS1 from a show), as he walked towards the pole almost halfway he must have been scared because a few minutes later he started yelling at the help, a minute later the faculty members finally heard his scream and scream and tried to get him off the merchandise he was, @ CAPS4 took them almost half an hour to do it to come down. @ CAPS3 was the moment I made one of the greatest friendships I have ever had in my life. Many friendships are formed in the classroom and with the people you will work with, but a great friendship begins with a simple laugh that two people share. God laughs the last. @ CAPS3 is the name of @ PERSON1 son of @ CAPS2 and @ PERSON2. In @ CAPS3 @ PERSON2's story, @ PERSON1's @ CAPS5 claimed that she was surprised to have the chance to have her only child and people laughed and were surprised the same way she was. 'was when they heard the news. Being surprised or shocked can also make someone laugh at what happened in their surroundings or at what they did on their own. I remembered a time when I laughed at something that took me by surprise, @ CAPS4 was when my @ CAPS5 lost the keys to the house inside the car, we looked for them all the items but had no luck finding them, after an hour passed we called my dad to bring the other key home, after calling him we had to wait half an hour for my dad to get theirs, but as soon as my dad pulled into the driveway my @ CAPS5 found the key she lost in her pocket (@ CAPS4 was a typical cartoon moment ). When we heard the news we all started laughing at what had just happened, we were all shocked and a little stunned when it happened. As you can see, being surprised can also bring a smile and a laugh to someone's face. Imagine looking in the eyes of someone close to you with a blank face and trying not to let out a small laugh or a smile, then you find yourself laughing all the time for no reason. It's basically an everyday thing for me and my sister. My sister and I can't look at each other for even a minute, we eventually start laughing for the first five seconds and end up laughing for a hole hour non-stop, but as soon as we stop laughing we notice that we were laughing for nothing. right, which would make us laugh for another hour. It's the kind of laughter that two people who are so close to each other, the kind that you don't need a reason to laugh at but end up laughing for no reason all. @ CAPS3 shows the connection that two people have with each other. You know what the other person is thinking. Laughter can come from old memories of family get-togethers for the holidays, friendships we made when we were in school, memories of our childhood and what we thought was trendy and cool then are now. things that we look back on and laugh at, being a little surprise, and maybe just knowing someone by heart.
Laughter I laugh every day. I feel a lot of different emotions when I laugh. Some of the emotions are happiness, sadness, and pain. I use laughter to show my emotions. when i laugh i generally feel happy after wards and the less i cry because i am hurt. When I'm sad I tend to laugh and smile a lot to hide the pain I feel because I don't want people to see me sad all the time and think I'm playing the sadness card to attract Warning. But laughing and smiling make everything worse instead of making it better. When I'm sad I tend to rely on laughter to get me through my day because if I didn't have to laugh people would ask me what was wrong all day and that would drive me crazy. When I'm angry the only way I can laugh is if a friend or family member tries to make me happy or if I remember the fun times I had. It makes me happy when I'm laughing and brightens my day when I'm angry. I also laugh at things that people tell me even if they hurt me when they say it, because I don't want them to know that they hurt me. When I'm happy I just smile and laugh. Laughter lights up my life when it's happy laughter. My friends and I can just sit there and laugh for hours and nothing. My friends and I can be pretty dumb sometimes and all we can do is laugh and have fun and be in a good mood, and that makes me pretty happy. Some things in my life that make me laugh are my nephew, my family and my friends. All of these things that I just mentioned come to mind when I think about laughter. I think every person in their life needs to laugh in order to be happy.
Laughter @ CAPS1 Laughter is everywhere. It @ MONTH1 is three lower tilting doors into a comfortable living room. He @ MONTH1 be at the nearest playground bouncing off the seesaw. It's @ MONTH1 in an elegant restaurant sitting at a small table in a far corner. For me, he lingered in an old fifth grade class. I stumbled through the door with the purple @ CAPS11 backpack and the pale @ CAPS11 lunch resting in @ CAPS11's left hand. I recognized everyone from @ CAPS11 from previous grades of elementary school and joined them shortly after visiting @ CAPS11 hook outside the door. I was eagerly awaiting the turn of @ CAPS11 in fifth grade. The legendary @ PERSON1 was known as the coolest teacher around. He played a big part in the gossip of the young students, and each of us had high hopes. "@ CAPS2 your places @ NUM1 students !" announced @ PERSON1 @ CAPS3 with an infectious smile. The children scattered around the room looking for seats near their closest friends. Everyone listened intently to @ PERSON1's introduction to the year. Her voice caught our attention, but not too exciting compared to our expectations. He looked very nice as most of the teachers come, but still nothing spectacular. The day dragged on. The sleepy faces returned and the vivid colors had escaped our touch. The day finally ended, unsatisfying the impatient children. The next day dawned quickly and I trudged back into the disappointing classroom. To @ CAPS11's surprise, the next day was nothing like the first. The @ CAPS7 class has undergone a radical change. Each wall was filled with endless colors. Posters overlaid on plain paint with fascinating images and words. A sophisticated popcorn machine sat at the back of the room. Fresh popcorn was overflowing from inside. The smell passed through our needy nostrils as we entered. Mr. @ CAPS3 sat contentedly at his large desk as we walked back to our seats. He greeted us on our second day. After the first two minutes of class, I discovered that the rumors were true. He had a simple sense of humor that made every corner of the classroom laugh. His ideas and word choice concerned us as @ NUM1 reviewers. We found his subtle jokes quite entertaining for our young minds. He spoke like we spoke, he acted like we acted and he joked like we joked. He even created personalized nicknames for each of us. The laughter hovered above our heads like a heavy @ CAPS1, never continuing. The weekly popcorn servers handed out plush bags to all the children while the class read aloud. The kids were ecstatic about putting @ CAPS4 in danger and getting the teams together as quickly as possible. Her classroom became a place we wanted to stay forever, never parting with hour-long games and water blowing competitions. Despite the everlasting fun and games, @ PERSON1 showed us what it was really like to be a learner. He cared about our future and pushed us to struggle every moment of life. He taught us to write with desire and value. To express our feelings on paper and tell the world a story we want to hear. He was planning one on one with struggling students in a particular subject, and the next class their confidence had blossomed. He had the ability to reach our minds, to discover who we were and to emerge that hidden confidence to become @ CAPS9. We respected him, but we felt comfortable playing with him in class, as he often did to us. @ PERSON1 made us want to learn. @ DATE1 @ TIME1, I had started walking home, when @ PERSON1 @ CAPS3 stopped me at the door. "@ CAPS6 @ PERSON2C !" I said unexpectedly sharply, not hiding the excitement of @ CAPS11. He chuckled, "@ CAPS7 having fun in class today?" "@ CAPS8 yeah," I replied with a smile. “I'm glad,” he continued, then changing the subject, “I was thinking of having a huge dodge ball tournament at recess tomorrow. Does @ CAPS10 think that would be a good idea?” I chuckled inwardly, trying to understand the fact that an adult had said this to me, "That would be so much fun." “@ CAPS9,” he expressed excitedly, “@ CAPS10 is a really neat kid, @ CAPS10 knows that? It's great fun having @ CAPS10 in the classroom.” @ CAPS11's face lit up. I stood there smiling for quite a while. We finished our light conversation and I continued home. Every student in the class yearned to be loved by @ PERSON1, as if they were the most popular child in the school. I was loved by @ PERSON2 I was loved by the man who changed @ CAPS11's whole outlook on education and life. Little by little every now and then I go back to the carefree days of @ NUM1 grade and @ PERSON2 I always laugh at the ridiculous things that happened in this little classroom every day. Often times I glance above me to see this dense @ CAPS1 still hovering above me. Laughter left a mark on me and on these kids in class @ CAPS11 @ NUM1.
Laughter is a key part of all of my relationships with others. It lightens the mood for any situation and can really cheer me up when I'm having a bad day. It's often the icebreaker when I meet someone new and can help me connect with friends I already have. On the first day of school, freshman, I met a girl named @ LOCATION1. We were in writing class and there was a boy named @ CAPS1 sitting between us. @ CAPS1 and I were talking about our schedules, and he said something that made our conversation slightly uncomfortable. I looked up and saw that @ LOCATION1 had heard what he said and had a look on his face that was somewhere between being embarrassed for me and almost laughing. I smiled at him and said the word "awkward" when @ CAPS1 turned away. It was her signal that it was okay to laugh, and she did so subtly. I had no idea that that first laugh would lead to many more in a friendship that would develop almost instantly. After the first week of schedule changes and student travel, we found out that we had all of our classes together except @ CAPS3. We probably spent more time laughing in those classes than we did working, and I'm not sure how we managed to do all of our classes. Spending so much time together was only a matter of time before we had enough jokes to fill a dictionary. Almost any word or just the sight of something related to one of our jokes can make us laugh out loud. Sometimes we have nothing to say at all. I'm just going to watch her, and we're going to laugh out loud. For this reason, our friends often question our sanity. When we start to laugh, they look at each other, then look at us to find out why, or ask us if everything is okay. They don't understand us as we understand each other. People always confuse our names even though we don't look alike at all. Our names don't even rhyme, or start with the same letter. But I can't really blame them. We look so alike! From the activities we participate in to the way we think, we could almost be the same person. She makes me laugh every day and she's one of my best friends. @ CAPS4 is another friend of mine who constantly crushes me. Whenever I'm with her I'm always afraid to pee in my pants. She's not as close to me as @ LOCATION1, but we have become best friends this year. We have a lot of classes together this year, and that's probably why we got closer. We always do stupid things together, and we laugh about it all the time. For example, she and I like to laugh really loudly and exaggerate our "ha" s when someone tells a really bad or cheesy joke. Our biotech teacher loves to tell cheesy jokes, so when we're in her class, we sit together anticipating one of her jokes so we can laugh. We also like to chew our gum with our mouths open, to make the chewing sound louder. I often laugh so hard that I can't even chew. I know I'll have a great day if I'm with @ CAPS4. She can make me laugh in a way that a lot of my other friends can't. It's coming from deep inside, to the point where you can't even breathe, and tears are rolling down your face. It makes your whole face sore, even your eyes, from being wrinkled for so long. He's such a nice person to be around and I'm happy to have him among my friends. Laughter is a very important part of the relationships I have with others. If my friends couldn't make me laugh, our friendship would be so much more boring. Nothing would be fun. If I never laughed, I would never be happy, and it's not a life I'm ready to try. Life is hard. It's not easy, and it won't always be smiles and smooth sailing. There will be sadness and rough waters. But no matter how hard this @ MONTH1 life gets, I know I'll have friends like @ LOCATION1 and @ CAPS4 to share a laugh.
Laughter is like cooking; it brings people of all kinds together, but the wrong food or the wrong time can get in the way of you and others around you like beans. Laughter is medicine. Laughter is a universal language; you can speak the "language" @ CAPS2 with a foreign friend, even if you don't know an ounce of their native language. Laughter differs, ranging in intensity, pattern, gentleness, and attitude. You have laughed for weeks in the world of @ CAPS2 and you will laugh about it too. Sometimes in life, it's important to laugh! Laughter is indulgent and a nod to acceptance. It was my first year and I had arrived early that morning to keep company with my friend whose mother had dropped her off so early due to transportation disputes. I didn't even know why we were fighting or why we were on @ CAPS2 particular topic ; I only knew we were off on a "bunny trail" and @ CAPS4 was separating me for something I had done weeks ago. Our voices grew louder and despite our disagreement not taking a physical turn, our lyrics were equally devastating, taking hits under the belt and giving both teams "black eyes". @ CAPS4 was right and I knew it, but did @ CAPS4 really have that complacent air ? I thought, "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 hadn't done what @ CAPS4 did, I wouldn't have any secrets to share." @ CAPS2 had been wrong of me too but my attention was not focused on that but more on deflecting his fiery words of course not to let my guard down and start crying or something ridiculous like that. “This has only happened once!” @ CAPS4 said as @ CAPS4 tried to defend himself. "Way @ CAPS3, you didn't have to tell the whole world !" "I haven't said anything to the world," I objected. "I only said to a person ... who said to a person, who said to another person ... and so on." @ CAPS4 raised an eyebrow like @ CAPS1 to say, "@ CAPS5? You @ CAPS6 know what I'm talking about." The air in the room was as stiff as our direction in our argument, going nowhere and getting to no point. The feeling was mutual; @ CAPS4 was done with me, I was done with her. @ CAPS4 casually leaned against the wall, trying to appear listless, when her ankle succumbed to the gravity and the current humidity, grazing the surface and causing her to lose her footing. All the cool @ CAPS4 had been thrown out the window. His shoe caught the slippery surface of the wet tiled floor from which hundreds of trampled footsteps had been left by that morning's downpour. While collapsing, @ CAPS4 encountered the ruthless stone floor with a @ CAPS7 ! which left his face dazed and his pride altered. I wish that was how the conversation had gone - with her not three feet tall and me towering over her. Concealing the slight satisfaction that lurked behind my dimples, I slowly slid along the wall that stood behind me, coming up to her. I glanced into his eyes, as @ CAPS1 waved a white flag, then the blissful victory left me. I craned my neck back, smiled at the ceiling, and chuckled. I don't know what @ CAPS4 thought of it at first, but slowly but surely @ CAPS4 managed to laugh. My chuckle erupted into a fit of giggles, she grabbed it and quickly left us both lying on the floor. There was nothing particularly special about that dark, speckled tile, but it was this desolate stone that we found ourselves slumped over with our head snuggled up and hands on our stomachs, trying to bring our breath back to life. normal that morning. Of course I apologized and @ CAPS4 agreed, but I think his forgiveness was taken for granted ; laughter does not depend on words. "@ CAPS8", @ CAPS4 succeeded with a smile. The laughter that my friend and I had shared in that preschool classroom lasted all day. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." This very distance brought confidence to the relationship I shared with my friend. No, it didn't solve our problems, but it reminded us of how stupid and meaningless our petty arguments were, which is definitely worth a laugh. Of course, his fall from grace triggered the expression of innocent surrender on my part, laughter, but it was the letting go of bitterness and the welcoming of laughter from both sides that put end to everything. So, no, while we weren't on the same brave wave, our laughter was above taking sides - we were still speaking the same "language".
The @ CAPS1 of laughter Laughter, one of the best feelings that an individual can have. When you are feeling sad, angry, or having a fight, laughing can turn any negative feeling into a good one. Although @ MONTH1 doesn't want to show the turn of the emotion, it's very hard not to. Laughter is an important thing to have in abundance throughout your relationships. Laughing is a wonderful feeling. Whether it's a laugh or a hilarious explosion, it completely changes the mood. Laughing with someone is even better. Having relationships that are full of laughter is an important part of a person's well-being. Sharing an @ CAPS3 is a great way to make friendships and grow them. The no-laughing relationship ends soon. It's almost impossible to be good friends with someone without being able to @ CAPS3 together. Laughter is something that needs to be exhibited often in relationships. Without it, there is no connection, joy or excitement. There is no middle ground if you fail to @ CAPS3 with someone. People need relationships with humor. Laughter binds people of all ages. When I was still in diapers I watched a video titled "I @ CAPS2 to @ CAPS3". I would watch this countless times during the day with my parents and siblings. Now whenever this video is posted we have a great time remembering those days. Being able to @ CAPS3 together has taken my family relationships to the next level. Relationships are very important to have; including laughter will only make them stronger. Not only is laughter important, it's contagious. Laughter can alleviate a difficult situation and boost everyone's morale. It's very hard not to @ CAPS3 when someone else is laughing. Everyone also has their own @ CAPS3. Sometimes it's someone's @ CAPS3 that makes the group laugh. Doing more @ CAPS3 is also a wonderful feeling. Comedians build careers by making people @ CAPS3. There are good feelings that emerge when you can make someone @ CAPS3. @ PERSON1 is one of my favorite actors. I @ CAPS2 his style and the way he sets up his jokes. He knows how to make people @ CAPS3. All friendships need someone who can lift your spirits. However, laughter doesn't have to come from making fun of someone. This should come from the situation or circumstance that the @ MONTH1 group is facing. This is the key to having a good actor in your circle of friends. The healing powers of laughter are real and they work. There have been studies on how laughter can heal the body. Things like laughter therapy are very real treatment for people in difficulty. Norman @ CAPS4's book, “Laughter is the Best Medicine” explains in detail the powers of laughter. @ CAPS4 looked at The @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 and laughed at the wellness. It shows how much you need to laugh to be good. Laughter is so important to a person's health. It lifts morale and alleviates moods. The fact that there is laughter therapy shows that if you don't have enough laughter in your life, he @ MONTH1 is not as healthy as he could be. If your friendships lack humor, seek it out. Laughter is one of the most important feelings to surround yourself with throughout your life.
In this essay, I'll tell you why laughter, conflict, and trust are so important in a relationship. I have a very good relationship with my cousin. We will laugh, fight but always trust each other for everything. We have known each other and have been together for @ NUM1 years of our lives. Its name is @ CAPS1. I love him more than anyone in the world. One thing that brings us together is that we laugh at the mistakes of others. When one of us is wrong, the other laughs at them and then tries to solve the problem. When one of us messes up with something, we're always the first to know what or who it was with, even if we don't like the other person they're having trouble with. Conflict I think is something else that I think is very important in a good relationship. Me and she fight with each other all the time. Even if it's for the smallest, dumbest thing. We always find a way to fight for something. If it's for the other to spoil where it could or could completely ruin my life or his life. We protect each other from the mess are lives too. We keep each other from doing really stupid things. We have a strange feeling when the other is hurt or could be hurt by someone or something. Trust is very important in a relationship. Trust, you can be there or say anything to anyone, whatever it is. Me and her now everything now on top of each other. If you want something on me now, you can go and see her and she can tell you. If you wanted something about it now, you could come and see me and I could tell you. I could say anything to her even though she was going to be mad at me for a while if I ever really needed her to be there for me, now she would be ASAP. We will hardly ever judge the other for something they have done or are going to do. We now what the other person did and what they didn't do as well. I would entrust my life to him if I had to. She is my best friend, my favorite cousin, my mom @ NUM2, my sister and everything for me. Me and she will always laugh at each other's mistakes. We will always have some type of conflict with each other, but we will always be there to help each other for whatever reason @ MONTH1. these are the @ NUM3 thing i think you must have a good relationship with someone like i do with my cousin @ CAPS1. and i still have this relationship with her and i can never lose her no matter how hard i try to do it, now she will always be by my side.
Bell rings. Mix, mix. @ CAPS1. Break. EEEE. Rift. Snap. Click, stomp, @ CAPS1. Press press press. CLICK. Crack. Shoof, Shoof. Sigh. Seventh lesson of the day. Here we are. "@ CAPS2! Are you going or not? We have studied this class-l + á. You can go to the library if you want ...." @ CAPS3 everyone blinks at me, @ PERSON1, @ NUM1le and @ ORGANIZATION1, chocolate hair and mocha skin, impatiently awaiting my answer. The truth was, I knew @ CAPS3 didn't really care if I was coming or not. It made no difference to them if I was dragging a few feet behind like a pathetic puppy. I was quiet but lovely, loved only because I was a @ CAPS4. Because I spoke agitated @ CAPS5. Because I was the exchange student, because my translator and my colorful clothes were so shocking for ten seconds and then were forgotten. I was a flock of haircut seagulls. So why are you here? I thought. Why did you go in exchange? You are the complete opposite of everyone here. Nobody wants you. Go home. But my ego had a ready answer. You begged for this, remember? For months and months, it was everything you wanted, everything you thought about, everything you dreamed of. So I went with the girls. As expected, @ CAPS3 came down the wide staircase for three people side by side, and I awkwardly dragged myself behind them. Finally arrived at @ NUM2scalier, we sat down at a table, the three girls chatting. I stared at my eyes, trying to look lost in my thoughts, as if I didn't care if I wasn't included. Selfish thoughts buzzed through my head; if @ CAPS3 wasn't talking to me, why should I bother talking to them ? I really had no idea how @ CAPS3 felt to me. What does someone think of his shadow? @ CAPS3 notices, sure, but he never offers insight, he never makes you laugh. It's all about trust, said my mother's voice, it's all about the way you behave. But I knew it wasn't that simple. I was too foreign. These girls would never understand me, as I would never understand them. In frustration, I started to throw peas across the room with my spoon. Pat, flick, push. This sparked the interest of @ PERSON1, as @ NUM1le and @ ORGANIZATION1 discussed something very emotional. Tears started to fall from @ ORGANIZATION1's eyes. Sniffing, she and @ NUM1le went to the bathroom, leaving me all alone with @ PERSON1. Only @ PERSON2 could have felt my same emotion as he watched @ CAPS6. Silently, I continued to shoot polka dots. @ PERSON1 just looked at them as @ CAPS3 rushed into the room. Suddenly, with a horrible miscalculation, a pea hit a boy in the face. And then he turned around and swore. And then @ PERSON1 and I looked at each other from across the table. And then we laughed. We laughed so much that I cried. So hard that huge alien tears flowed from my eyes. People around us were laughing too, even though @ CAPS3 had no idea what was so funny. I didn't even know what was so funny. But that didn't matter, because we were streaming with tears and snot, reaching out to each other, piecing together the pea hitting the boy's face. It was like we had been friends for years, and there was laughter all the time. He was saturated with all the angst, loneliness and hopelessness I had felt over the past four weeks. The connection we felt was instant, like lightning, the kind of connection I felt with my best friends back home. I felt this huge swelling sensation in my chest, like a balloon was stuck inside. My stomach ached and my cheeks were so sore I could feel them seize up. My heart felt whole even for that second. My soul was open. It was the best laugh of my life. Sniff snort. HALET. To laugh. HALET. Flow of tears. Sniff snort. To laugh. HALET. That is why. I thought. This is why you have come. Bell rings.
I didn't believe my grandpa when @ CAPS2 told me that laughing could cure everything. I was nine, the days were dark @ cold CAPS3 @ CAPS3 I felt like my life was a shattered piece of a stained glass window. Not only @ PERSON2 my ageless pit bull just died @ CAPS6 but my little sister would tease me if I dared to shed a tear for the loss of my best pet. I sat in the bus, watching the crackling fire @ CAPS3 erupted, when my grandfather sat next to me @ CAPS3 told me a story. It was about him, when @ CAPS2 was young @ CAPS3 how lost @ CAPS1's best friend too, only @ CAPS1's friend was not a pet. "@ CAPS1 was called @ PERSON3", @ CAPS2 started, "@ CAPS3 we were eleven years old. Oh, how much fun we had. All we did was @ CAPS7! We thought we were getting old together @ CAPS3 be each other better men @ CAPS3 cause trouble in the end. @ CAPS2 was my best friend until the end. I loved him, much like you like @ PERSON2. I never thought that something would happen to him. I thought we would both live forever. @ CAPS6 then something happened. @ PERSON3, @ CAPS2 had gone fishing alone because I was in church @ CAPS3 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 had to work, @ CAPS3 it was such a wonderful day for @ CAPS11 to the river @ CAPS6 then @ CAPS2 never came back from the river ... "@ CAPS5 sniffed the old story," @ CAPS6 you see , @ PERSON1, there is a cure for sadness. Do you want to know that @ CAPS9 is ? " I half-nodded thinking there was some medicine or some magic spell. "@ CAPS7." @ CAPS2 said. "@ CAPS9 ?!" I was completely shocked. “@ CAPS10, it's just,” @ CAPS2 said softly, knowing my easy-going temper, “@ CAPS11 through the stages of grief. Feel a little lost, @ CAPS6 then find your way back. @ CAPS7 is in your heart @ CAPS3 always will be. Find a wave of joy @ CAPS3 @ CAPS11 with the flow. Love life because as you just saw it can be so short. " I nodded @ CAPS6 n didn't look at @ CAPS1's sober face. @ CAPS2 kissed the top of my head. @ CAPS2 looked me in the eye (didn't dare to meet the intensity of @ CAPS1) @ CAPS3 I knew @ CAPS2 had seen the reflection of blazing fire in my watery blue eyes @ CAPS3 could see my treatment @ CAPS9 @ CAPS2 had just told me. Then @ CAPS2 let me think. I needed to move on? How? 'Or' What? Life was not that easy. I knew it. I opened my notebook to do some homework to clear my mind @ PERSON2, @ CAPS5, @ CAPS3 @ PERSON3. It was then that I discovered a small piece of paper the size of a deck of cards. I turned it over, showing it was a picture. A tear fell from the corner of his eye. It was from me @ CAPS3 @ PERSON2. We were both in a mud pit. My blonde hair looked like dirt (considering I was rolling in the mud). My pit bull was rubbing @ CAPS1's oily head on my shoulder, coating me with more mud. I smiled, I missed him even more, @ CAPS6 feeling a lot better than a minute ago. I liked it. I loved him so much. I still do today, @ CAPS6 I had to get over the fact that my friend was gone. After seeing the pic I had laughed at myself automatically feeling better for being such a horrible granddaughter @ CAPS3, reckless best friend. @ CAPS6 seeing the good times we had, @ CAPS3 smiling, honestly made me feel better about myself. Eh? Maybe laughter is the cure for everything.
@ DATE1 was the start of a new era, I had just had @ NUM1, what a joy I thought it was. I had been around so much for my birthday party, that I couldn't even stand it. my mom asked me what i wanted to do for my birthday i told her i wanted to party and sleep. she agreed, so that night we planned and made invitations. this week passed and before I found out it was party time. I invited @ NUM2 of my best friends and all my family. we had such a great time the time flew and it was time for everyone to go, three of my friends stayed the night there was, @ PERSON1, barbie and @ CAPS1. my parents threw a party and we were home alone all night. it was around @ TIME1 and we were all looking at the hills having eyes. we all had a big crash, top to top we all went up to the top of the stars and saw myself get hit and we all panicked. we came down from the stars screaming i called my mom and thinking someone was in the house they rushed over to the house thinking it was a real emergency. my mom and dad got into stars to check it out and they found out it was my black cat mouse he came in through my window and jumped on me not hard enough he clapped.
The bus flew over tight bends. Beyond the windows, farmland, rocky cliffs and peaceful rivers streamed past. Exhausted from the fourteen hour flight, I barely knew what time it was. The only things that kept me awake were the jerks of the bus and @ NUM1 other @ CAPS1 that I barely knew while chatting quietly. We were going to visit and live with a group of high school students, affectionately known as "our @ CAPS2". I had met partner @ CAPS16, @ LOCATION1, only once. Everything I knew about her, her life, her family, I learned maybe ten, maybe @ NUM2 short messages @ CAPS3. Communication was going to be problematic. @ CAPS16 mother started teaching me @ CAPS4 when I was two, but I was far from being fluent ; I was embarrassed and uncomfortable with native speakers. @ CAPS5 from @ PERSON1 was decent, but his family only spoke @ CAPS4. Finally, the bus walked down the narrow cobblestone streets of @ CAPS7. He stopped in a square full of people. The doors hissed open and we began to stride through the crowd, standing on tiptoes in search of our new families. All around me people were chatting in a mix of @ CAPS4 and @ CAPS5. @ PERSON1 and his parents waited somewhere in the middle, and I slowly weaved @ CAPS16 towards them. Brigitte, @ CAPS16 host mother, hugged me. "@ CAPS10 gehts? @ CAPS10 war dein @ PERSON2? How @ CAPS18 you? How was your flight?" @ CAPS11 from @ CAPS16 @ CAPS4, I hesitated, "@ CAPS13 @ PERSON2 war sehr langalso ich bin ein bisschen muede. The flight was very long, so I'm a little tired." @ PERSON1 took @ CAPS16's arm and led me uphill to the school, where our welcome dinner was being held. She explained, "@ CAPS14 is very happy to meet you. @ CAPS7 is so small; we never have tourists. We only host @ CAPS15 exchange students every two years." @ CAPS16's stomach was filled with that nervous feeling of nervous anticipation. Normally making friends was easy for me, but this time it was different. I understood very little of the language and culture of the people around me. The long flight was evident in the sleepless bags under @ CAPS16's eyes and @ CAPS16's greasy, knotted hair. @ CAPS16, the jetlag brain wondered how I would get along with these people. Would I fit in, could I slip into @ CAPS4's life without too many hitches or snags ? We went from the archaic street to a dark tunnel-like entrance. After a few laps, we emerged into an open courtyard. An assortment of food covered several tables and the smell of grilled bratwurst hung in the air. "@ CAPS18 are you hungry? You should have something to eat. We have so much food here," @ PERSON1 told me. I grabbed a plate and placed a bun, strawberries and a sausage on it; I was too anxious to be really hungry. @ PERSON1 directed me to a worn out table with wooden benches, where his friends were already having dinner and having a few beers. She introduced me, and I perched stiffly on the edge of the seat. @ CAPS14 spoke enthusiastically, asking me about the life of @ CAPS15. As @ CAPS14 relaxed they started joking, sometimes @ CAPS4, sometimes @ CAPS5. Some of @ CAPS2 teased me about @ CAPS16's accent. It wasn't a mean tease; they weren't trying to be mean, just light and funny. So I laughed. At that point, I seemed to fit in better with those people I only understood sometimes. I was less a stranger than a new friend. Relaxed, I allowed myself to laugh at @ CAPS16's mistakes and really enjoyed being in an entirely new place.
My friend @ PERSON1 and I have had friends @ CAPS1 since grade six. We have @ CAPS1 through so much together. Even though we don't have everything in common and we don't hang out together outside of school, we do have a lot of laughs in our friendship. I'm saying if you want to have a friendship that lasts, you have to laugh at it to make it a fun friendship. When @ PERSON1 and I were in the @ NUM1 class, we were the tallest up to the sixth grade because we were in the highest grade in our middle school. We would have so much to do. @ PERSON1 and I were still walking the halls linking our arms and moment after moment she was just pushing me towards someone. For someone to break into a locker or a wall and we are laughing, it's crazy. It was fun for us, but the other people cared a bit, but not that bad. Another thing we would do to make each other laugh would be when @ PERSON1 and I had big tickling fights. It would always start with one of us trying to put something in our mouth. I was still trying to put a piece of paper in his mouth and to get me arrested @ PERSON1 was tickling me. @ PERSON1 again I am like the ticklish person on the face of the planet. This once happened when we were in front of our school desk. We tickled and tickled each other until we were laughing our buttocks on the flour. Well a teacher came over and told us to stop and then the bell rang and so we went to our classes. Well @ PERSON1 was the office helper and so when she went to the office apparently one of the office workers saw us tickling each other and thought we were going out. @ PERSON1 told me she just said "@ CAPS3" and started laughing. I laughed about it a lot. Laughter is good for me because without it @ PERSON1 and I wouldn't be best friends like we are today in @ NUM2 grade. You see, our friendship started with laughter. I met @ PERSON1 in the 6th grade class @ CAPS4. Our teacher had assigned seats and @ PERSON1 and I and two other people had to sit together. I had no idea who she was at the time. We ended up saying something and laughing about it and soon she introduced herself and so did I. Well the seating arrangement changed and she sat down somewhere and so did I. I got a bad grade in the @ CAPS4 class and told my teacher I didn't get along with the people at my table and asked if I could sit somewhere. He said yes so I went to ask @ PERSON1 if I could sit on the empty chair the guy was sitting on before I walked away. She told me she didn't care and so on, we started hanging out at school together and had so much fun. So you see. Laughter is a big part of the life of a lot of people. You need it. Without it, I would never have made my best friend that I have today. I thank her for helping me through my difficult years. Without the laughter of this world, we would probably be lost. Just think about what you might not have or what you might miss if you hadn't laughed in your life.
I remember my freshman year when I was on the soccer team when we played the Bull Dogs at @ LOCATION1. We were losing in the first half and before the first half one of our goalkeepers injured his hand. So they took him out and they put the other goalie in and one of the other players on the team hit the ball so hard it hit the goalie in the stomach. So it took his breath away and me and the hole soccer team started laughing because it was funny how he was jumping up and down and saying he was going to pass out and he just had his breath cut. So the first goalie who got injured, he had to come in because nobody wanted to come in as a goalie because they were too scared to score against them. After the first half we scored @ NUM1 goals so we won @ NUM1 to @ NUM3. The reason we made fun of the goalie was because it was funny how he reacted when they took his breath away. Also because he was our friend because if he was we wouldn't have laughed about it, but after the game was over we asked him if he was okay and he said he was just doing it pretending even if he really wasn't. The main reason it was all funny was because one of our goalkeepers had the wind in their sails and overreacted when he only had the wind down and how he said that he was going to pass out and when he said it he said it with a smile on him like he was pretending.
Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. Often things happen that make you laugh. For example; someone trips over your backpack and @ CAPS7 falls @ CAPS3 on their face. You can't help but laugh! Then you start to feel bad and wish you didn't laugh at them for tripping, but then you start to remember how @ CAPS7 fell and you think about it and you end up laughing so hard you can't get over it. stop until you are in trouble. Laughter is a big part of your life, at least it's not a part of the day when you aren't laughing. Everyone in my family is fun and @ CAPS7 always makes me laugh. This is not a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say "awkward silence". We always laugh and have fun and we are never sad. Let me tell you about the times my family laughed as we stepped back in time to remember those times that we now call “ good times ”. I will tell you how much laughter is a part of my family. And how the embarrassment is involved. It's a beautiful sunny day @ CAPS3 @ DATE1. Today was a big day for me, @ ORGANIZATION2. It was the day I was going to organize my @ CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ ORGANIZATION1, and sat @ CAPS3 on a chair getting my hair done. I was wearing my @ PERSON1 pajamas with a black shirt that said "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3". I had my hair done, makeup done, put on my @ CAPS3 dress, go out to take pictures and buy @ CAPS3 the limo so I could go to church. After going to church I took pictures with my family and then I went to @ CAPS4 to take pictures in the @ ORGANIZATION3 building. After we got back from @ CAPS4, I went to @ ORGANIZATION1, @ CAPS6, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my main courtyard; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz, I danced the second waltz with my father. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my main courtyard and my partner and towards the end came the biggest one ... I was supposed to be picked up by my daughters and the guys were supposed to spell my name @ CAPS7 ran in front of me and the girls when one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran right instead of left and misspelled my name! The guys were supposed to spell "@ ORGANIZATION2", with two guys wearing black @ CAPS3 on each end, but @ CAPS7 ended up spelling "@ CAPS8" ! One of the other guys saw the error right away, so he moved to the left and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, @ CAPS7 ended up spelling out "@ CAPS9" ! I'm not going to lie ... I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong place because the letters were facing me, but I could have prevented that from happening but I didn't because that I couldn't! But in the end, it was funny. Everyone started to laugh and I was so ashamed! But when I stepped off the dance floor, I started to laugh! Now that we think about it, this is the funniest thing that has ever happened to our family. I guess the laughter is really there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But the laughter is always there when we have an awkward moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter whether we like it or not, but we end up doing something stupid that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I am with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy and cool. No matter how sad we are, no matter if we are sad because a family member was in a car accident or someone has passed away, we remember the times we were happy and we remember each other. were having fun with this person. We end up remembering the pleasure we had together, that we start to laugh very loudly! Laughter is there when we're happy, but it's also there when it's the happiest day of your life. Laughter is a moment of happiness.
Laughter is a good thing, except in certain cases. We've all been there. Have a good time with friends, laugh and make new memories. Then you drink something and start laughing again. The next thing you know is that you are choking and can't breathe. You cough as much as you can, trying to stop. It's not only a little embarrassing, but it can get a little awkward as well. You can't stop it, you just have to let nature take its course. Everyone is looking at you, wondering if you are okay. This moment feels like an eternity, and that's exactly how I felt. I have two best friends, @ CAPS1 and @ PERSON1. It was during @ DATE1 and we decided to have a little movie night at @ ORGANIZATION3. We were fully prepared with sweets, soft drinks, and best of all, pizza. Everything came together for a great evening. We decided to watch the movie @ ORGANIZATION1. These are all our favorites, I think we can never get enough of them. @ CAPS1, @ PERSON1 and I found comfortable seats and started watching the movie. We ate, laughed and made comments with it. We were having a great time. Then I decided to have a drink of my @ ORGANIZATION2. I was about to swallow it, but luckily one of the funniest parts of the movie was underway. I started to laugh and knew I had a problem. I put my mug on the table, quickly got off the couch, and took two steps when most of the @ LOCATION1 in my mouth fell to the floor. I couldn't breathe and was coughing now, so I kept running to my destination, the kitchen sink. I was about two feet from the sink, I was so close! Then I felt something come up in my mouth that I couldn't control. I wasn't going to open my mouth, it would be all over the floor! I was so disgusted that I threw myself in the sink. My mouth opened and the vomit went down the sink. I continued to cough, wondering when this would all be over. "@ CAPS2 are you okay ?!" @ CAPS1 ran into the kitchen and started hitting my upper back, trying to help me. @ CAPS5 hit me three times, then I was finally able to breathe again. "@ CAPS4 you, I was having trouble." @ CAPS5 started to laugh, as I was still disgusted with the bad taste that remained in my mouth. I put my head under the tap, trying to drain it a bit. I grabbed a towel and we walked into the living room. We entered the room to find @ PERSON1 sitting on the couch, laughing hysterically. @ CAPS1 sat down next to her and started to laugh with her a bit. I got down on my knees and started wiping the @ ORGANIZATION2 spill off the floor. There wasn't too much, but still a good amount. I started to laugh a little while cleaning it up. I thought to myself, "@ CAPS6 do I always have to be the choking one?" "@ CAPS6 didn't you just go to the bathroom sink? I mean, it's right there!" @ PERSON1 was pointing to the door and still laughing. "I hadn't thought about it! I just ran to the kitchen!" I have been to her house several times before, but the bathroom escaped me. I laughed at how much of a blond moment I had just had. “@ CAPS8 my God,” @ CAPS5 laughed a bit then continued, “@ CAPS9 me from @ CAPS10! When I saved you!” "@ CAPS11 and watch the movie !" I told him jokingly. @ CAPS5 stopped laughing and we were enjoying the film again in peace. They both always tease me about it, but I don't mind. It's just going to show you the things that laughter can do in unexpected ways.
Has there ever been someone you know who made you laugh like no one else could? Or have you had a moment or a @ DATE1 where you laughed like there was no tomorrow ? Laughter is something anyone can relate to, no matter their age or personality. It fills you with a warm feeling that pours down like a waterfall. There isn't always a reason for the things people do, there is always a mystery. The same applies to laughter. Sometimes you are so happy that everything is building up inside that you have to let it go out. During my 6th grade @ DATE2, moving into 7th grade, my friend @ PERSON1 and I were almost inseparable. @ PERSON1 was the first friend I made when I moved from @ LOCATION1, @ ORGANIZATION1 at the start of my sixth year, but in no time we were best friends. On @ DATE1 we were alone at my house and wanted to do something fun and creative. So we decided to make a fort with sheets and furniture. We took chairs and the ends of some sofas and tables @ DATE1 and tied sheets and blankets, falling on ourselves and not paying attention to anything else. We made a fabric plane about three or four feet above the ground, high enough to crawl under and sit on. We then took a thumbtack in the wall and pinned a sheet to hang on the flat sheet like our walls. We then filled the makeshift tent with pillows and blankets to sit on. On @ DATE1 of our adventure, the living room was messy and furniture was everywhere. It was as if a tornado had passed through the house, even though it wasn't the biggest or the best fort we had built. But we didn't care, we had fun building it. I remember sitting in the fort and telling him about everything that came up. We talked about the school, the people and life in general. We made jokes the way we like to and just fed each other good feelings and energy. I was in seventh heaven and no one was about to knock me down. This @ DATE1, I laughed like there was nothing wrong in the world. I was carefree and wasn't afraid to show it. We were both laughing almost constantly to the point of crying, although when I look back now some of the things we laughed at weren't that funny. It was one of those days when laughter fills you with so much energy and joy that you can't even contain yourself, and it's so contagious that others can't help but join in. We let ourselves escape with cries of joy and cackles. I had never laughed so much in my life and I never wanted it to stop. It wasn't necessarily because of something funny @ PERSON1 had done or said, but I was so happy it all sounded worthy of a laugh. And every time I started to laugh, she couldn't help but join in, and that only made us laugh harder. On @ DATE1, we were both emotionally exhausted. @ PERSON1 ended up spending the night because we never wanted @ DATE1 to go. But, ultimately every @ DATE1 ends, every morning is a new start and every night a @ DATE1 has something, but when you close your eyes to sleep after a long @ DATE1 of laughter, you feel full. No happiness, but life. And that feeling is not something that comes off easily. So live and laugh like today is the last @ DATE1, and never forget the memories you made back then.
The @ CAPS1 of laughter In @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 laughter is important to me, we all laugh in our lives. It's a symbol of happiness, and it shows people around us that we care enough @ CAPS3 to listen and pay attention. With laughter, we can create memories that last a lifetime. For my friends and I, laughter comes naturally and we all enjoy it every moment. My friend @ PERSON1 and I have known each other for second year and have been friends ever since. what made our @ CAPS2 strong and still alive today are the memories we made through laughter. A memory that I always remember, @ CAPS3, this is the first time we went inner tube together. There were many memories between @ PERSON1 and me that we remember from the laughs we shared. However, the memory that still remains dominant is when we went on the inner tube for the first time. It was our seventh year at DATE1 and we had planned to spend as much time as possible together. Now that didn't really work because @ CAPS3 was doing a lot of babysitting, but she was a good friend and understood. So when we went out it was always a lot of fun. Now, yeah, we've had our ups and downs, and that comes with any @ CAPS2. We went through this and ended up having one of the best summers together. This @ DATE1 we were hanging out with each other and going together. Then one day @ ORGANIZATION1's parents decided they wanted @ CAPS3 to take a @ CAPS3 trip on the lake and go boating. @ PERSON1's family invited me @ CAPS3 to come over, so I asked and was able to @ CAPS3 go with their family @ CAPS3 the lake. I had already done boating and @ CAPS3 the lake we were going to too. What I was not expecting was for @ PERSON1 and me @ CAPS3 I go in inner tube. It was exciting and scary at the same time; I had never laughed so much with @ LOCATION1 in my life. Going to the inner tube turned out @ CAPS3 to be one of the best memories we have ever made together. Throughout @ DATE1, whenever possible, we had switched to the inner tube, for me the adrenaline was almost addicting. Laughter was almost always constant while sailing because we just had the best time. This was our new story that @ CAPS3 is telling everyone and we were both proud of it. When the inner tube we had learned that @ CAPS3 works together and this has helped our @ CAPS2 a lot in a way. Also on the inner tube we got @ CAPS3 the point where we went as fast as we could and got as crazy as we could and loved it. This @ DATE1 we made some of my most treasured memories, and we really owe it to all of the @ CAPS3 laughs. With laughter we can create memories that last a lifetime, and I am very grateful for that. Seriously, I don't know where my @ CAPS2 would be with @ PERSON1. And because of that, I believe laughter is important in any relationship or @ CAPS2. It is a symbol of happiness and it is what makes life beautiful.
I have always loved laughter in my life, I don't know how I could live without it. This is how it all started. One day, I was not having a good day. Nothing could have made me laugh. Friends were telling my jokes, they were making faces. It didn't make me laugh at all. There was just one thing they hadn't tried that made me laugh, until my sister finished this thing. I will never forget that day my sister and I had a water balloon fight. On a hot day @ DATE1 my sister and I were still playing water balloon fights this time she walked through a water balloon and it hit me in the face. I also walked through a water balloon and guess what happened, it hit his face. We just couldn't stop laughing, we were just out of breath from all the laughing. My sister decided to tell me this story when I wasn't having a good day, even when people were trying to make it better by making me laugh. The only thing no one said was that once during @ DATE1. Until my sister reminded me and told me this story. I just start laughing from that day forward. Then my sister took me outside, she had prepared all the water balloons, we start to cross them. That day when I wasn't having a good day turned out to be the happiest day of my life. It's a day I'll never forget to laugh. This is why I love laughter in my life, it makes my bad days turn into the best day of my life.
One day my friend Taylor and I had the idea on a snowy day to take his quad and tie a rope in the back, he was drifting around a pole, he didn't see the hill and i was in the back on a sled and hovered over the quad and reached about @ NUM1 feet high then crashed it hurt but it was so funny we couldn't stop laughing for ten minutes. at the back i was driving along the bank and it was on the ice then it started to crack so i went faster so it didn't fall then after about two minutes the ice cracked and it fell under then took him out and drove like as fast as the quad could go and went home he got changed and then he just sat there and laughed for hours at About what the two of us did.
In any situation, laughter is used. Several times I have been in an awkward position and used laughter to release the discomfort. Laughter will never go away and you will always have it with you to use it when you need it in a revolting moment. For example, @ CAPS1 a month ago I was walking at the park with my brother and some friends. When we arrived there were already people at the skate spot where we wanted to skate. We decided it was okay, we would just get on with our business and skate. "@ CAPS2 punks ! We were here first !" one of them said. My brother and I started to scream back. Then one of them hit me in the face and started talking a pile of garbage so I said something to him @ CAPS1 that was so funny all of his friends laughed. He was pretty pissed off but that didn't matter because we ended up skating there anyway and nothing happened. It just comes to show that laughter can bring us together anytime. No matter what your skin color or where you are from, you can still be funny. Some people can be funnier than others, but everyone has a sense of humor in them. You can always find the time to make a joke or come up with a clever, hilarious line to make someone laugh. Laughter is the only thing you can rely on in an awkward position or when you are going to a new school or have never been anywhere before. Laughter can always keep you from fighting, no matter what. All over the world people are laughing at this time and bonding by it. It is the sign of happiness and gratitude. Laughter has a purpose and will never go away. Laughter creates bonds. The bond is to love. Laughter is together.
When we understand the benefits of laughter, we realize we can't live without it. It's one of those things that will always be with us in difficult times and the joy of life. So when people say "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people", well! You can think of whatever you want, but I want you to know that I have the best laugh in the world when it comes to the boy I fell in love with. It all started in a corner softball tournament. Our team went there on the weekend to play our tournament and we stayed at the @ LOCATION2 inn. Which was also very nice, probably too much for our team, because we end up destroying the place like a bunch of footballers in a locker room, hence the hard training. After our practice, we go ahead and swim in the pool, even knowing that we have a big game the next day. The hotel had two large swimming pools, one outside and one inside with a sauna. We all go to the indoor pool because it was too cold outside. Then everything from there was a little different. My friend @ PERSON3 and I go to the sauna after swimming to relax and chat a bit. After a while, two boys our age enter the sauna while we were still there. They acted like they were nervous and shy, so they sat down and started talking to us, which was a bit awkward, no doubt. When it comes to boys, I don't hesitate to speak my mind and ask them why the hell they just sit there pretending to mind their own business, and I know for a fact that it is. not why. We talk a little while laughing and have gotten to know each other. One of them was extremely sweet and I got on really well with him. It happened later in @ TIME1 and it was time for all of us to go back to our rooms and say goodbye forever. Me and @ PERSON3 shared a room with his parents. I knew @ PERSON3 gave my number to @ PERSON1, the guy I liked in the sauna. About ten minutes later, I receive a text saying "meet outside for a walk". So I had fun that it was him, and I got all excited! so we snuck out of the room for @ TIME1. All we did was walk around the hotel and talk, he was barefoot and as cute as he got. I have never laughed so much in my life! He made me smile and I felt like I could handle anything that came my way. About forty-five minutes later, still looking into each other's eyes, feeling like it had only been a second. His friend @ PERSON2 sees someone coming out of a hotel room and realizes it is his mother. They rush forward saying goodbye and at the last second he kisses me on the cheek to say goodbye. Never in my life have I experienced something so exciting and fun, and above all I understand the importance of laughter. Knowing that I would never see him again is what kills me. He lives at @ CAPS1 and I live at @ LOCATION1. How could something have happened between us? Maybe one day I will meet him again. Maybe one day I'll be able to talk to him again like we did at @ TIME1, and maybe I'll fall in love with him. All of these maybe came true, because I set aside what was right and waited. Now feeling that it all happened, I can reflect and understand the laughter and how it affected me in my life. This is what brought us together, and I'm glad it could all happen so quickly in my young life.
I kept my head down as I walked the halls of the brand new school I had signed up for. The students passed me with warm smiles, but I didn't dare meet their eyes, I couldn't. This is what the real school looks like, I thought to myself. I had always been homeschooled, since before I could remember, and now my parents felt that I should be introduced to a public school, in my last year of college @ CAPS12 less. My dark curly brown hair fell over my face as I entered my first acting class. The room was warm and dimly lit as the students began to recite their lines; the settings were colorful and I immediately recognized them as the garden from @ LOCATION2 to @ LOCATION1. I suddenly gave a little cry when my foot got stuck in the door stopper, sending me falling onto a chair. A dark red color flooded my cheeks as I looked up and realized that every student in the room was staring at me. I heaved a troubled sigh and brushed my hair over my face, wishing I was back home, in my favorite chair, studying for my mother's vocabulary tests. I peeked through my hair and a quick smile spread across my face when I realized I was @ CAPS12 more the center of attention. "@ CAPS1, you must be @ CAPS2, the new student." @ PERSON1 warmly said. I smiled and nodded slowly, "@ CAPS3, that would be me." @ CAPS4 smiled at me like I smiled at @ CAPS13, but @ CAPS13's smile looked sad, "I'm sorry dear, but all the parts in this room have been taken, but you are more than welcome to help to paint defines the next course. " I nodded and reached into my backpack, pulled out a book and quickly buried my nose in the pages of my favorite romance novel. I was instantly taken to another time and place, and wished with all my heart that I could really go. I was suddenly pulled out of my imagination when a little pixie-looking girl sat down next to me. @ CAPS4 didn't say anything for a moment, just looking at me. @ CAPS13 hair was a few shades darker than mine, blacker than brown but @ CAPS4 was wearing @ CAPS14 @ CAPS8. @ CAPS13's bright blue eyes were sparkling with imagination, as was @ CAPS13's face. Something about @ CAPS13 sounded nice. Maybe @ CAPS14 was the way @ CAPS13 dimples came out even though @ CAPS4 wasn't smiling, or @ CAPS14 could have been the way @ CAPS4 sat, tall with confidence. "@ CAPS5, hello ?" I whispered, closing my book, making sure to mark the page. "I didn't mean to interrupt you, but you looked all alone, and I thought I would come say hi. My name is @ CAPS6, but everyone calls me @ CAPS7." @ CAPS4 said with another smile, bringing out the dimples even more @ CAPS13. I laughed softly and smiled back at @ CAPS13 : "@ CAPS8, I'm @ CAPS2, nice to meet you." "@ CAPS10, don't take it the wrong way, but you're not from around here, are you ?" @ CAPS4 asked hesitantly. My smile faded slightly, "@ CAPS12, I've always been homeschooled, never been to public school before." @ CAPS13's smile fell with mine, and I could tell @ CAPS4 knew what I was talking about. "@ CAPS14 isn't always a bad thing, I'm glad I can finally go to a public school." I whispered, the lie coming easily. @ CAPS4 laughed and put a soft hand on my shoulder, "@ CAPS12 must be lying", I knew half of @ CAPS13's words were serious, and the others were upbeat but something inside me had changed. I barely knew this girl but felt I could trust @ CAPS13 and we could be friends. We laughed and joked with the rest of the class, and I was almost always taken by how @ CAPS4 constantly got upset trying to explain things to me. @ CAPS4 would try to use @ CAPS13's hands, make moves, just to explain, which always took us into a new set of laughs because of how ridiculous we both were and I was surprised when the bell of the lunch rang, did I really have time to go so quickly? @ CAPS7 smiled at me, "@ CAPS16 for lunch @ CAPS2?" A smile spread across my face, maybe I wasn't as lonely as I had thought. With just a few laughs and chuckles, an entire friendship was planted in soil that I thought was too stony to contain any life. By opening up just a little, and showing a side of vulnerability and even fear, I had opened the door to a whole future of conversations, smiles, tears, secrets but above all hope. This place was @ CAPS12 more a place of torture and exclusion and sadness, but a place I could go to see my new friend, a friend who eventually became my sister, a woman I started to trust and understand with all my heart, and I finally realized we weren't as different as I once thought. We were one and the same from the start.
I tell you times sometimes even adventures with a boy named @ CAPS1.C. @ CAPS4 has brown hair that goes up to her neck, which @ CAPS4 loves to spin around like in the movies. @ CAPS4 definitely don't like her too short bangs, otherwise the swoosh won't turn out the same. @ CAPS4 has brown eyes that just seem to glow and a smile that seems to cheat everyone. “@ CAPS2, @ CAPS4 is so adorable,” they say. "@ CAPS2, @ CAPS4 so cute", they say. @ CAPS1.C is cute, but does things that will amaze you ! Things you wouldn't think a kid his age could make possible. As I always say, "@ CAPS4 will make you work for your money!" The thing is, @ CAPS4 is only @ NUM1, well right now @ CAPS17. @ CAPS4 loves attention, @ CAPS4 will do almost anything for it. Yet @ CAPS4 is very adorable and adorable at times. @ CAPS4 enjoys comedy, cartoons, candy, video games, artwork. @ CAPS1.C is a lot of fun trust me when I say you will never be bored ! I think when @ CAPS4 was @ NUM2 1 / @ NUM2 when the adventures started. @ CAPS4 would always go in the fridge and just @ CAPS8 in the egg cartons and check if there was anyone around. Then @ CAPS4 would grab one and toss it and say, “ @ CAPS5, chicken ? " With a baby-type accent, so adorable! but @ CAPS4 would try another and another and another until all the eggs were splashed all over the place. @ CAPS4 would run away knowing we were getting close to him and hiding. I have to admit, I didn't know who was doing all of this at first. I kind of thought it was @ CAPS1.C, but I wasn't too sure. It was just a mischief. @ CAPS4 also liked this aquarium which was there, very bright because of the light it just seemed to attract it. @ CAPS4 would get closer and closer and just @ CAPS8 to fish. Watching them swim, all pretty different colors. The rocks and the small toys seemed to attract him more. When @ CAPS5 was around @ CAPS4'd @ CAPS8 above the tank and slipped his hand very carefully and said "@ CAPS7!" trying to try to catch it, but @ CAPS5 succeeds. When @ CAPS4 heard someone approaching or approaching him, @ CAPS4 would run so fast like the loony toons bird cartoon always stinging the coyote. There would be a mess, of course. Although everyone knows that @ CAPS4 would be a problem once @ CAPS4 started to work ! @ CAPS4 was so cute though. Now when @ CAPS4 was between the ages of @ NUM4 and @ NUM5, @ CAPS4 loved to pick on people just for fun, or so we thought. @ CAPS4 does it for attention, so we would drop what we were doing and run after him. What @ CAPS4 would do was grab something that was of value to a certain person and walk up to them and say, "@ CAPS8! I have it, I have it." Of course we had to run after him, but sometimes you 'I have to be careful because otherwise @ CAPS4 would throw si and wham ! It would slow down. there are only a few things i am highlighting here, but in reality there was a lot more and it was more exciting than it could explain ! age @ NUM5 was a workout ! One day, we decide to lend @ CAPS1.C our touch @ CAPS10 to entertain him because we were busy doing our own things and @ CAPS1.C discovers you tube! @ CAPS4 loves this show called @ CAPS12 and @ CAPS13 ! In other words, @ CAPS4 calls it, “@ CAPS14 @ CAPS15 @ CAPS16.” @ CAPS17 @ CAPS4 would go on it and watch most TV shows on the @ CAPS10 touch and use the apps on it ! @ CAPS4 is very smart when it comes to using electronics if I add @ MONTH1. The next day, @ CAPS4 would request the @ CAPS10 contact almost frequently, then whenever @ CAPS4 was denied use, @ CAPS4 would use their methods to get it ! Of course what @ CAPS4 did is when the lights were out and everyone was sleeping @ CAPS4'd @ CAPS8 everywhere, when finally @ CAPS4'd @ CAPS8 under the pillows and grab them and take it with him. The next morning we were after him! @ CAPS4 told us, but again @ CAPS4 would ! Then we went to drastic measures, we hid the @ CAPS10 keys elsewhere. now @ NUM1 years old ! whoa, well @ CAPS5 in my opinion I think @ CAPS4 has calmed down a bit more. Others @ MONTH1 don't think so, but I know it! Anyway, @ CAPS4 is now @ NUM1, which means @ CAPS4 is now starting school ! what I hear is quite entertaining for those who are not involved ! They love @ CAPS1.C but sometimes @ CAPS4 can be a bit too much, ha. @ CAPS4 love to go for walks doing what @ CAPS4 loves most and have a good time, which I admire. well if i had to tell a little story about him as @ NUM1 year old i would choose, how much @ CAPS5 matters what @ CAPS4 would always stand up for his brethren ! @ CAPS4 won't let @ CAPS5 one bully his brothers, @ CAPS5 no matter what the odds ! I admire him the most, that's it!
Laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness. It is becoming amused or mocking. Today, a lot of people make jokes or funny remarks just to hear someone laugh. It is never something we should take for granted. Across many relationships, whatever the nature, I think laughter occupies at least @ PERCENT1 of your relationship. It's to show someone the best and let them know you're listening. There are many other reasons in this world necessary to laugh. "I'm sure you can even think of one". In my vision of this world and our society today, I believe that laughter is what constitutes our "human" spirit. It is to show ourselves and to show others the spark that we have in us. Have you ever sat down and wondered why we are making each other laugh? I have asked myself the same question over and over again. For me, making people laugh is letting them know that I care and also thinking that I'm funny too. We even do it just because we want people to like us better and to be known as funny, hilarious, or just a good person to talk to. Sometimes we can go so far as to be too funny and feel guilty for picking on someone in a laughable way. I remember that in eighth grade I was thirteen. I was really shy and didn't have a lot of friends. One day in class, some of the popular kids came over and started talking to me. I was @ CAPS1 excited and nervous for other kids to want to talk to me. Of course, they were laughing and making jokes, not caring what other people said. Then this girl started talking to other people like she knew everything. When she started talking about my best friend, it made me angry but happy at the same time, because some of the things she was saying were true. This is where I screwed up, I started talking about all the other nonsense she did, just to make everyone laugh. As I sat there all I felt was guilt and disappointment in myself. I couldn't believe I was sitting there talking about my best friend, just trying to make myself popular. Later that day she came to me really upset and couldn't understand why I would do this to her. I told him that I was sorry and that I had only done it to make myself popular and to appear funny to other children. We didn't speak for almost two weeks. @ CAPS1 I tried to do everything in my own way to get my best friend back. It took a while, but she finally came back and forgave me. It was a great lesson in life for me knowing that @ MONTH1 laughter isn't always a good thing. Now my friend and I are juniors in high school and when we think about that day. We can both share a laugh. In conclusion, you can see how laughter can bring someone up and tear them apart. I have also experienced these things in my life. Laughter made me stronger and in order to be a better person, even if it means turning down popular kids @ CAPS1, you don't hurt your loved ones. "@ CAPS1 go out and make someone laugh today."
Laughter is very important in my life. I laugh every day. People wouldn't be the same without laughing, and the world wouldn't be the same. Two days ago my @ CAPS1 class went to the computer lab to type our @ CAPS2 writing test. Much of the class was moaning about having to write this essay. I was annoyed because I had already passed the test, and I didn't want to take it again, but I had to. Once I got to the computer lab, I sat down in my chair and logged into my account. After a few minutes my computer finally loaded and I was able to connect to @ CAPS2. Once there, I logged in and my computer locked up. I had noticed that some of the other students' computers had also frozen. I laughed at them because their computer was frozen, and they laughed at me because mine was frozen. After a few minutes, my account finally connected and I chose to give it a try. After my computer was frozen for a few minutes, I got an error message and it logged me out of @ CAPS2. This had happened to @ MONTH1 of the other students as well, and I laughed because my classmate's computer was still frozen and the screen was blank. I reconnected and it froze for a while. I tried to log in again, but kept getting different errors. I noticed that many of my other classmates had also received these error messages, or that their computers were still frozen. After a few attempts my test finally loaded and I was able to start the test. After debating for a while, my teacher told the whole class to log off as only a few members were able to make it to the test. I then signed out and reconnected to @ CAPS2. My computer started to log in, but then it froze and logged me out of @ CAPS2. It had also happened to many other students who were taking the test. After trying to log in, the furthest I could get was to wait for my @ CAPS7 to approve me. My @ CAPS7 said he approved me several times, but nothing worked. After a few minutes without my computer letting the test pass, I signed out of my account and signed back in. At that point, I was laughing because it had worked before, but I couldn't retake my test. More than half of the period had now passed. No one, not even @ CAPS7, knew what was going on, but very few people had started their test. After a few more tries, and nothing could work, the course was almost over. My @ CAPS7 told us to take the computers offline and wait another day to complete this test. When I walked into the room I thought it was going to be a very boring time. I was wrong, in a good way. The class was not boring and I spent a lot of time laughing. Although I did not complete my essay, it was a good class. It was a good experience, and I'm sure I will be able to look back and remember this day for a long time.
Laughter is something that everyone needs in their life. We all need humor, and sometimes we even need to laugh at ourselves. You need a laugh, a smile, and a sense of humor to live fully. When people take things that others said differently, or even think a joke was said too harshly, and they take it the wrong way. People said to me, ' you need a sense of humor, you know ? " @ CAPS1, I feel bad for taking it too seriously. Back then, my sophomore year, I was going through a tough time. With friends and family more and more distant from each other. I don't even remember laughing or smiling last year. Let's just say that in the first four to five months of second year, it was hard to try and fall for a simple joke. Once the second year was drawing to a close, I realized there was more to life @ CAPS1 moping in my own self-pity. @ DATE1's vacation was approaching and I know I wanted to do @ DATE1, and my junior year, my year, and no one would spoil it for me. After being all sad and not having fun, and laughing at my dad's jokes on me, I know I needed a lot more hanging out with him. When my dad and I spent time together we had more @ CAPS1 laughs that I couldn't even remember. It was a great memory to have. Especially with my father. My self-esteem improved a lot @ CAPS1 than before. I was really happy with myself that I only tried once, and now I also had a better relationship with my dad. So far, life has been going well for me. I realized I was happier when I recognized myself and told people the real truth about me. I have to say that I have never smiled or laughed as much as I have in a while. The truth about me is that I was diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder. I didn't have any therapy, I just knew it was the real me, and that was probably why I was so sad in my sophomore year. When I discovered myself I knew there was a lot more to be done than @ CAPS1 had a better reputation. I was able to smile a lot more and appreciate everything and everyone who wanted to be my friend, or even get to know me a lot more. It was really nice knowing that people wanted to be interested in me a lot more and would ask me questions about who I wanted to be called and what a transgender was. I felt wanted, interesting, secure and above all; happy. I know I was going to experience even more harassment on my way out. I had a lot of restricted numbers calling me and I made fun of anyone who sent me hate messages, calls and texts. It was definitely worth the laughs as I knew what I was talking about and they didn't know anything about transgender or gender identity disorder. Hanging out with my dad and more friends really paid off. I survived a hot @ DATE1 and now it was time for school. I was really excited for the start, and even more excited for the sports ahead. I knew I was going to kick my junior year up and no one would get in my way. When it was around my birthday, like, a month after starting the school year, I realized I needed someone there all the time to make me laugh and smile all the time. Not that I wasn't smiling or laughing, I just know that I needed it more in my life. There was a girl who started talking to me on @ CAPS2-book. She was really cute, her personality suited her so well and already she knew how to make me smile so big, my cheeks would eventually burn me. Her name was @ PERSON2, and that suited her too, everything was so awesome about her. We ended up talking on the phone at noon in @ TIME1 on my birthday. By far it was the best night I have had in a while and the sweetest thing someone has ever done for me. @ PERSON2 and I spent some time this weekend at @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4, at @ LOCATION1. When we headed there her friend, @ PERSON1, was singing along to @ CAPS5 songs, while @ PERSON2 laughed at her squeaky voice. I have never laughed so hard that my stomach would tighten in pain. So you see having a lot of people there to make you laugh is a really amazing feeling to be had. You even have to laugh at yourself and laugh at your idiocy. Getting to know someone new is a perfect feeling, especially when it melts your heart and gives you butterflies every time they say something sweet. Even just to make your @ CAPS2 shine with a smile.
In a relationship, you should be able to trust each other, confide, talk, cry with each other, and most of all, laugh with each other. A lot of people believe that laughter is an important part of relationships, and I can certainly agree with that statement. The relationship in my life that I laugh at the most is the relationship between me and my best friend and boyfriend, @ PERSON2. He can still make me laugh, even in my worst days he can find a smile and a chuckle. I constantly thank @ CAPS1 for bringing it into my life. The first thing I really noticed about @ PERSON2 when I got to know him better is that he can always make me laugh. Whether he's giving me totally weird faces or tickling me until I can barely breathe, he always knows how to make me laugh. When I throw my eyes at him, even then, he can make me laugh. Right at @ TIME1 I had had a terrible day at school and within minutes of yelling at him he cheered me up and made me laugh. At church or with some friends we're just going to look at each other, make a face and start laughing, there's something about those blue eyes and that silly smile that will always make me laugh. Our ability to laugh with each other has been an important aspect of our relationship from the start. When we play @ CAPS2, or he's playing and I'm not trying to play, we always laugh at how bad I am, or when I finally get an awesome kill. “ It works, doesn't it ! " Is one of our inside jokes, of course it's not that funny, but we have fun at rival who can say the most in one day. The rule is that you have to have a good reason for saying it and if we say it at the same time we always have a fun chat about who won or who gets "the point" (like we are keeping the score), but it usually makes us laugh. some stupid excuse or reasoning that one of us is trying to use. Whenever there is a camera around @ PERSON2 likes to make funny faces which will always make me laugh. Then we usually end up taking about 20 silly photos and going through them and laughing and laughing at all the weird faces we decide to make. When one of us starts laughing the other laughs too, they say laughter is contagious. To be truly comfortable with each other, you need to be able to laugh at yourself. Once, @ PERSON2, his little sisters, @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON1 and I were all seeing how high we could kick and to make a long story short I knelt at the front, @ PERSON2 was the only one who noticed or heard the crunch of my bones forcefully hitting each other, and he fell silent until I started to crack. Then he made sure I was okay. We were laughing so hard we cried and I had a big red circle on my forehead, not to mention my cheeks which were also bright red from the embarrassment, but I just laughed. Another time we were fooling around on the hardwood floor of his house and I pushed him to the floor, his whole family was creaking and his face was bright red, but he didn't care. Whether we say or do something stupid in front of each other, we both have the ability to laugh at it. Even when the going gets tough or you don't agree on something, it's always good to be able to come back later and have a laugh with each other. Just because @ PERSON2 and I are best friends doesn't mean we agree on everything, we actually disagree on a lot of things, most are small, but every now and then we will disagree on something a little bigger. Sometimes one of us will do or say something that disturbs the other, we are still able to figure it out and later come back to it and laugh even when it's a touchy subject. We've both made mistakes in our past, but again, we look back and laugh. Obviously, I also have reason to agree with the statement " Laughter is the shortest distance between two people " because I have this connection in the best possible way. I'm so grateful to have @ PERSON2 in my life, his ability to laugh and make me laugh is what made me fall for him in the first place. So between "@ CAPS3" on an SMS, cracking up on weird things we're doing, or just watching a movie, we always make fun of each other or each other. As we would both say " were creepy soul mates !" "
Every day that I spend with my girlfriend is a day full of fun and laughter. I can be in the worst of moods and she can brighten up my whole day with @ CAPS1 a few words. Together we can turn any situation into a happy one. What I'm trying to say is laughter is a very powerful thing @ CAPS1 by making someone laugh you can change their mood, their day or in some cases maybe change their whole life. People say laughter is very contagious. I believe it is. Take comedians for example, they can take any situation and make a whole room laugh. My favorite is when this comedian said "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 shaking with cold, we'll bring him silver and gold", like the song. He then said "@ CAPS4 don't they @ CAPS1 bring him blankets, I mean the poor kid is going to die of hypothermia but at least he'll be rich when he does." I wrote this article to show how powerful laughter is in the world. I believe everyone should laugh at least once a day to make the world brighter. I conclude with this "A smile can light up a room, but laughter can change the world to a happier place". No one should go through life without laughing. "A life without laughing is a life that does not happen".
A true story for me in the laughter. My favorite memory of laughing happened two years ago @ CAPS4 I meet my friend @ CAPS1. I meet her at @ ORGANIZATION1. I was coming out of @ CAPS4 from @ ORGANIZATION5, @ CAPS1 was coming in. We collided. First of all, we were both mad at each other and we were just like, "@ CAPS3 look where you are going !" @ CAPS4, we both calmed down, we went our separate ways. I went to the food court and not even ten minutes behind me she was there. We both waited in the @ ORGANIZATION3 queue. @ CAPS1 and I just stood next to each other for a while, until I apologized for meeting her earlier. She said, "@ CAPS5 this is @ CAPS6, I should have watched where I was going other than looking at the ground while walking." We laughed for a little while until it was our turn to eat. After paying I asked her if she would like to sit with me because we were both alone at the time. The reason we were alone was that both of our parents were doing more shopping. We started talking about where we came from and what schools we went to. @ CAPS1 goes to a private @ ORGANIZATION2 @ NUM1 in @ LOCATION1, @ ORGANIZATION6. I told him I went to @ ORGANIZATION2. We were both in our first year of @ ORGANIZATION4 @ ORGANIZATION2 and we both loved the group. @ CAPS1 and I just noticed that we met once in a group competition. We crossed paths in the same way at least a year ago before we crossed paths again. As she left one of the rooms where her group was warming up. I had just crossed the room to go to the room where my group was warming up two doors down. I was just walking, just like @ CAPS1 was walking in @ ORGANIZATION1, I was looking at the floor as I was walking. Plus, we both got mad at each other. We both laughed for a moment laughing at the way we were doing the same thing, but the other way around before. We both changed a lot and we both knew we would be great friends. I guess by laughing with someone you can tell if you're good friends or not. Laughter is an important part of friendship. I mean, what's the point of having a friend @ CAPS4, you don't even have a laugh every once in a while and have great memories with each other. I'm still hanging out with @ CAPS1 until this day and we still can't believe we met twice the same way.
Laughter is a very important part of life for many different reasons. Some @ MONTH1 say it's vital to survive, you have to laugh to have a full and rich life. Sometimes laughter can hurt more than it helps. It is a statement that I believe in myself and that I have concluded from the actions and results of my life. Laughter can show emotions towards a statement, or a lack of emotions. Laughter can make someone feel depressed or happy. It's true when someone says there's a difference when someone laughs at you, as opposed to someone laughing with you. When a friend or a group of friends laughs with me, it is an amazing emotion that increases self-esteem. This laughter brings friends closer together and makes us trust each other more. I once thought laughing was appropriate back then, but later I felt awful. One scorching day @ DATE1 my friends and I decided to venture into the mall as we lived in apartments and ran out of money for an air conditioner. We all agreed it was a great idea. When we got to the mall, we were relieved by the cool breeze as the doors opened, as if to greet us. We're all very introverted, so shopping in a crowded mall was not our cup of tea. Not knowing what to do @ CAPS1, we sat down on a bench and did what we call the people watching. Their was that girl, I will always remember her; @ CAPS4 was one of those girls you look at just a minute and you know @ CAPS4 was rich. Some sort of stuck girl, a stroll where @ CAPS4 wants to exaggerate her hips and bounce her perfect bleached blonde hair. The girl walked past us and rolled her nose in the air like we weren't even good enough to be around her. A little angry I got up after @ CAPS4 walked past and laughed at his strut. My friends found it hysterical. Bursts of laughter erupted from their mouths. The girl in a hurry stopped walking and then started to approach us. @ CAPS4 makes a face at all of us like a snob and says, "@ CAPS1 do you like having a problem or something?" @ CAPS2 covered my face, I didn't know what to say. Luckily my best friend stepped in and said, "@ CAPS3, we think your dress is very pretty." @ CAPS4 believed us, then walked away, in a slightly less posh way. Through this strange and interesting experience, my friends and I learned a lot. First, people can hear you talking about them from a mile away. Second, laughter can bring friends together, but it can also have consequences. I @ CAPS1 don't know for sure if @ CAPS4 heard or saw us laughing at her. But I knew inside that I felt a little bad. Of course, laughing at her at that point just felt right, funny. Come to think of it, I feel bad. I was in the same situation but on the reception side. It's not nice to have people talking about you behind your back and laughing uncontrollably. Laughter is essential for life, but must be appropriate.
DAIRY @ CAPS1 my boyfriend and I spend a lot of time together, @ CAPS2 two days ago @ PERSON3 and I had just had an argument. her mother had just finished preparing food. he wanted me to try it out and see if I liked him. but before eating @ CAPS3, if he ate it with me. "maybe just a little," he said, standing up to pick up a fork. I thought he was going to eat it with me but it turned out he was just sitting next to me talking to @ PERSON2 @ CAPS2 about the fight he had just been in. The fact that he didn't eat with me really didn't bother me. I continued to eat, I separated the food by color to make a face on my plate. it turns out he looked pretty good, he looks and says "what is this supposed to be?" with a smirk on his face "that's a face! ... see the carrots are the nose the shrimps are the eyes the greens and the noodles form the mouth and the hair" I look up with a smile "I want take a picture of my face on the plate? " I say "no" he answers "@ CAPS4" I answer I remix everything and continue to eat when I have finished I get up, put the plate in the sink, go back to the table and sit down. @ PERSON3 gets up, goes outside, brings more wood for the fireplace and begins to light it. I go upstairs to ask him if he's crazy he says yes now I'm sad. I say I'm sorry we brought it up and it turned out he was angry because I didn't let him take a picture of my food. after five minutes we were happy again @ PERSON1 suggests we go to @ CAPS5 we all agreed. when we got them we all ordered our food and waited. "Let's go to the wrestling mat ! ?" we all said at the exact time @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 stayed waiting for the order while @ PERSON3 and I when going to play in the small children's toys. we were fighting to make our way to the wrestling mat when we noticed all the little children looking at us like they had never seen older children play. we continued our little game of kicking, punching, slapping and scratching. I decided I needed some downtime so I sat down and took some long breaths. oh the tracksuit i hear that weird noise i look over and asked him if he farted he looked at me with a cheesy smile and after five seconds he repiles Yes. and continued to fart but the room seemed too quiet, we walked around to see that all the little biys and girls were hearing it too! it was little girls standing at the entrance, a little boy a few feet away from @ PERSON3 and two other little kids by the slide I guess they were shocked I started laughing at the tears i ran out of the playroom to go tell @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 what just happened, they also thought that was hilarious.
@ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 Laughter is a powerful tool when you know how to use it. He has the ability to inspire, when in doubt. Lift heavy spirits to new heights, and it can also create great devotion to a person, thing, or cause. So what has laughter done for you and me? Well that has done a lot for me, a good example would be my experience in @ ORGANIZATION2. At @ CAPS2 middle @ ORGANIZATION3 I had everything for me. I had good grades, teachers, but above all a group of friends with whom I was able to share a lot of laughs. When we graduated and went to @ ORGANIZATION3 my friends either moved or dispersed to other groups. It was horrible not having anyone to laugh with, which made things quite difficult. Then came the @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS3, or @ ORGANIZATION1 program. Since I wasn't really involved in the program, I didn't have any friends other than Vanecek. Then an opportunity to join @ ORGANIZATION4 @ ORGANIZATION4 presented itself, I seized it. Every afternoon, for an hour, we trained, which created a strong bond between the members of @ ORGANIZATION4. Before we filmed, we laughed about it and relaxed, which made it a fun environment to shoot. The @ ORGANIZATION4 quickly earned the nickname, @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1, due to all the laughs heard outside the booth. The @ ORGANIZATION2, of which my battalion is a part, hosts five competitions per year. With fourteen schools from @ LOCATION3 and @ LOCATION2 competing, I got pretty nervous. Before our first competition, we had been together long enough to think of each other as family. My family, seeing how nervous I was, pulled me aside the day before the shooting. We played cards, talked and made jokes, it was one of the most special moments of my life. We shot early the next morning, I wasn't nervous, just relaxed. Out of twenty-four teams, we took third place, not bad for a new family. Since then, the @ ORGANIZATION4 has taken first place, four times in a row. These victories, I must give credit to the simple human emotion of laughter. Laughter kind of inspired me to devote myself to a family and took me to new heights. I guess my question for you would be, what @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 are you a part of ?
Seeing one of @ CAPS15's best friends traveling and banging his face against a screen door was enough to make me laugh. It was @ DATE1 after @ CAPS15 @ NUM1 school year. I had friends @ CAPS15 @ PERSON2, @ PERSON3 and @ CAPS15 neighbor @ PERSON1 spending the night at the house @ CAPS15. @ CAPS25 never got bored, we usually went to the neighborhood @ CAPS15 "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3" some houses to have fun. "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3" is @ CAPS25 @ CAPS21 sneaking up to someone's front door, ringing the bell several times, then @ CAPS23 running away. The four of us were hanging out that day. It was a great day @ DATE1, beautiful sunshine, warm weather and a gentle breeze to cool your face. @ CAPS25 night was falling, we were all in the room @ CAPS15 playing @ CAPS7 @ NUM2. “I'm bored brother,” @ PERSON2 said to the three of us. “@ CAPS8 so, think about something @ CAPS19”, @ CAPS9 replied “Can't think of anything,” @ PERSON1 said with a bored look on his face. We sat for a while thinking of something @ CAPS19 to entertain the four of us. "Understood!" I said with a confident smirk, " Let's go @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 !" "I'm okay with that", @ PERSON2 said "@ CAPS13 me too", @ CAPS9 and @ PERSON1 replied shortly after @ PERSON2. As we walked out of the front door @ CAPS15 @ CAPS15 mom shouted, "Where are the boys from @ CAPS21 going ?" @ CAPS15 mom caught me off guard. I didn't know what to say " uh, we're going for a walk, " I replied hesitantly. “@ CAPS16 be safe,” @ CAPS15's mom said as I walked out the door. We @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 abandoned a few houses but it started to get boring then hit me like a typhoon. I had the best idea I have ever thought of so far. "@ CAPS18 this is what has to happen, I'm going to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS28 the first house, @ PERSON2 @ CAPS21 get the next one, @ PERSON1 @ CAPS21 get the house around the corner and @ PERSON3 will run around the corner for get the last home. "@ CAPS19 @ CAPS21 think this will work?" @ PERSON1 asked. "@ CAPS20 yes it will work!" I said, "@ CAPS21 @ CAPS18 ready?" "I guess so," @ PERSON1 replied shortly after @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON3 yes. We all lined up in place. I rang the bell at the first door and started to run, then saw @ PERSON2 slam his fist closed on the second door, then I didn't see @ PERSON1 ring the doorbell because he was already running in front of me. "@ CAPS9 take the last house !" I shouted at him. The house that @ CAPS9 was running to n didn't have her porch light on. @ CAPS9 was running fast towards the house and I failed to see the step in front of the door. I didn't expect what happened next. SMACK ! @ C APS9 tripped on the step and hit her face against the screen door. I could hear the click of the middle of the dark street. He got up quickly and turned to us in confusion: "Should I ring the doorbell? Should I ring the bell?" "@ CAPS23 run @ CAPS9 I'm sure they would hear @ CAPS21 slam their screen door. with your face! " @ CAPS25, we came back to @ CAPS15's house, everyone was laughing. @ CAPS9 @ CAPS23 made our night. This happened @ NUM3 years ago and I still remember it like it was yesterday. So the next time a friend of yours asks @ CAPS21 about "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS28" a house, think about whether the porch lights are on.
"@ CAPS1 mom, do you know where my purse is." I wonder where it is, I have to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking and found him in my room under all my dirty clothes. A sigh of relief washed over me, I was glad I found it before something happened. I woke up @ DATE1 @ TIME1 and thought it would be just another day. I had planned to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season, we were playing against our rivals, @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. The day was passing slowly, I couldn't wait for it to end. Finally the bell rang, school was over, I went home a little disappointed. I wasn't sure if my friends were going to the game with me, if they weren't going, I probably wouldn't either. I was determined though, I texted them at five o'clock and convinced them it would be fun. I first got my friend @ PERSON1, then @ PERSON2. That's when my normal day turned into one of the busiest days ever. The @ ORGANIZATION1 (where the match was taking place) was about twenty minutes away, I had to stop and refuel before leaving. We went to the cheapest place in town and filled my car up. When leaving, my car decided not to start. I have an old car and it doesn't start all the time, it sits there for a while until it wants to start. There were guys in the other way that we were new to looking at us. We just started to laugh, it was really embarrassing. The attendant asked us if we needed anything else and I said no my car just wouldn't start. I tried to turn it back on, but it kept dying. Every other day my car decided not to start today. Then some men came out and told me they had to move my car. I was so embarrassed and started laughing again. I always laugh when I get nervous. I told them to let me try to turn my car back on, I prayed that my car would turn on this time. It happened, I was so relieved and embarrassed that I left as soon as I could. Twenty minutes later we were in @ ORGANIZATION1 in front of the school, and just my luck again, no parking spaces. We walked around for about five minutes until we found one that was within walking distance. Then we gathered our things and went to the game. It hadn't started yet but it was about to do, I had a feeling it would be a very close game. Soon the game started and like I thought the game just kept coming and going, we scored a point, they scored a point. It was really exciting but where two parents behind us were really in the game. They kept yelling at the players, yelling at the ref and just annoying. The game was good, but in the end The @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 won by @ CAPS6 points. It was a little disappointing, but the @ ORGANIZATION1 had a good team. After the game we went to eat at @ ORGANIZATION2. We left the game quickly after the end so as not to get stuck in traffic. I was driving this road, thought I was new, but realized I didn't recognize it at all. @ PERSON2 told me to continue, she knew where we were. I stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight downtown via @ CAPS7. I arrived on one of the main roads and made my way to @ ORGANIZATION2. The road I was on had a million stop lights and I was stopping every @ NUM1 minutes. Then a pedestrian decided to cross the street in front of me, I waited for him to cross even though he was not even on a crosswalk. I continued carefree in my mind, the music exploding, when suddenly rainbow lights behind me. This day couldn't be worse, I stopped and waited for the @ CAPS8 to come to my window. He asked for my license and registration. I took my purse and looked in my wallet. My heart was racing where was my license that I had just put in my purse a few days ago. I started to panic and laughter filled the air. My nerves were mounting, I couldn't help myself. I looked everywhere finally he asked me if I had my student card, I went to take it out and there was my license just below. He walked back to his car, letting me laugh out loud. He came back and told me my insurance had expired, another thing that added to my day. I was still laughing when he gave me my speeding ticket and expired insurance. I think I got it because I was laughing and he thought I was taking it for a joke. You can't control the nerves, or at least I can't.
Laughter is the key to any happy and successful relationship in my opinion. It can break the ice in a sticky situation or help you get closer to someone. Some people have said that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and that laughter is the best medicine. I believe both of these statements to be true. Personally, laughter has drastically changed many different social situations over the course of my @ NUM1 years of life. One time in particular where I remember some laughs that really brought me closer to others was when I was camping with a few of my friends. It was three years ago in the middle of @ DATE1 and we were all sleeping outside under the stars. We had all been talking about pretty serious things, about family and friend issues, and about sharing our struggles in general with each other. I didn't have much to complain about, I had a pretty average family that I loved with good friends. However, that evening I learned some interesting but disturbing information about the family life of my friends. She started talking about how her parents didn't care and that they are both alcoholics, I could tell by the tone of her voice how painful it was for her to admit this information. The mood had suddenly changed, from a discussion of light issues to a serious, emotional conversation. She kept telling me how lonely she felt at times and how much she always wished that she could be with her friends because we always have a good time. After she told me all this, we went to bed in silence for a while. Neither of us slept but I didn't know what to say. I mean, how could anything I say make that situation better or make her feel better. While we had been having this conversation, our other friend had run to the car to get some soda and go to the bathroom. We heard her say our names and search for us in the dark. Suddenly she knew where we were, she had tripped over the edge of our sleeping bag, fell on top of us and spilled a bunch of sparkling grape soda all over our faces. Normally we would have been angry but we all thought it was hysterical. While in the middle of laughing like crazy I looked at my friend who had just told me her painful story, now she was crying with laughter so hard and I knew that a little laugh had brought us closer. It is a memory that I will never forget, it was an experience where I felt that laughter played a major role in making a relationship more comfortable and closer. Similar experiences have happened throughout my life. Laughter is a common ground, where all people can relate to each other. Maybe it brings people together because when you laugh legitimately, you get so caught up in it that you forget everything else. All your problems disappear.
Laughter Laughter has always played an important role in the relationships in @ CAPS2's life. Being able to laugh with someone creates a bond with that person. Through the laughter I was able to become friends with someone I can call to this day @ CAPS2 best friend. I met the person who would later become @ CAPS2's best friend through one of @ CAPS2's friends. A few friends of mine and I were hanging out and @ CAPS2's friend, @ PERSON1, said, "@ CAPS1 knows that @ PERSON2, @ CAPS1 should be talking to a good friend of mine. said about her, it seemed like it would be very easy for me to get along with her. About ten minutes later I looked at @ CAPS2's cell phone and noticed that I had a text message from me. 'a number I didn't know. I asked who the person was and waited for a response. Two minutes went by and I got a message that said, "@ CAPS2's name is @ ORGANIZATION2. I'm the girl whose curly haired kid sitting next to @ CAPS1 spoke to @ CAPS1. " Once I read this I started to laugh out loud. I never thought I would. a girl I had never spoken to would be brave enough, or sarcastic enough, to say something like that as the first thing she would say to me. For the hours that followed, we continued to exchange sarcastic remarks and jokes and laughs kept pouring in. @ ORGANIZATION2 is the kind of person who can make anyone laugh. That's what I love about her; @ CAPS3 has the talent to make anyone laugh that no matter where he is, his mood or what he does. We walked for hours and spent most of that time to stop and catch our breath because we laughed so hard. our ability to laugh with each other has helped us through some difficult times in our lives. @ORGANIZATIO's mom N2 passed away a few years ago and this left her in a state of depression. @ CAPS3 rarely felt happiness until we spoke. Our ability to start laughing at each other helped her throughout this time. I recently received a @ CAPS4.BI or @ ORGANIZATION1. I felt numb with the world. Nothing felt like it used to. Lucky for me, @ ORGANIZATION2 was able to come and do what I had done for her ; @ CAPS3 was able to make me laugh and feel normal again. Being able to laugh with @ ORGANIZATION2 definitely made our friendship stronger than it would have been if we hadn't been able to laugh together. Being able to laugh only affects @ CAPS4 a moment in time, nor does it impact a single person. Laughing means more than that. Being able to laugh creates bonds that just aren't possible without laughing. I felt what laughter can do in a relationship and I can say it really feels good.
"@ CAPS1 !" Today's @ CAPS2 company loves to laugh. From comedy shows to hilarious friends, people are having fun twitching with joy. Not to mention, when you're doubled over with laughter, you get an amazing workout. Anyone texting @ MONTH1 uses "@ CAPS3" or "haha" to show that they think something is funny ; but that's nothing compared to being with friends and having "a bright smile". I couldn't wait. I was on the coast in a camp with my friends, and we were about to make our way to the three crosses. Some of the other girls were asleep and we had to leave quietly. One of the girls tripped as we were going out and it took everything we had to not laugh out loud. Because when she tripped she barely caught up, as she was about to fall while sleeping @ CAPS4. Jasmine rushed for the door with the rest of us. Once the door closed, we all laughed. Jasmine's face, when she tripped, was priceless. We walked into the fresh air without looking back. From a gravel path to the cement road that goes up the hill, we happily jumped along. As the hill got steeper, we started to walk. Jasmine, after getting tired of jumping, almost fell back. Everyone started to laugh again. The climb up the hill was taking longer than expected. Finally, we could see the three crosses at the top. When we reached the crosses, we waited for the miraculous sunrise. We continued to look at the ocean; wait with impatience. Finally, @ CAPS5 pointed out that the sun is rising in the east and we will be passing through the mountains. Again all the girls laughed because we were so tired we forgot which way the sun was rising. Finally, the astonishing sunrise occurred. It was full of pinks, purples, yellows and oranges. After watching the sunrise we realized we still had the dangerous walk back down the hill. I looked over the edge and saw a little path. With great conviction, I took all the girls down the steep hill because it seemed shorter than the cement road we had taken. The first part of the way was straightforward. As we started to walk down the hill it got leaner with more brush. A few girls thought we should go back up, but I convinced them otherwise. So we went. "@ CAPS6 no !" @ CAPS7 yelled. We turned to see that she had managed to drop her shoe into a blackberry bush. She had just received her shoes the day before and now they are muddy and lost. Everyone was trying to reach it, but it was just a little too far. Suddenly @ PERSON1 tried to grab the shoe ; immediately she fell into the blackberry bush! @ PERSON2 forgot his shoe a bit and started laughing again. While beating and shouting, we yelled at him to stop because if I hadn't mentioned it earlier; it is a very steep hill. While in the bush she grabbed @ PERSON2's shoe. The hardest part was getting @ PERSON1 out. The first time we tried to pull it up ; we raised it a few centimeters and then it fell back into the bush. Finally, after what seemed like a million tries to me, we pulled her fat ass out of the bush. Everyone was laughing so hard during the extravagance. @ PERSON1 was super embarrassed. After all that, we made our way down the hill. We still had giggles as we trotted the trail. On the way, we saw animal tracks. We then realized that the trail was most likely made by an animal. A few girls joked that they were terrified of animal tracks. Finally, we returned to the cabin, still laughing at what had happened. The rest of the day everyone was happy and giggling that they woke up to an amazing morning. Laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day. Laughter helped us through the mud, the loss of shoes and the cold. Without it, we could have been very cranky. Plus, having amazing friends to laugh with was phenomenal. Laughter helps people be happy; to be happy is better than to be sad; therefore, laughter is important. While writing this article to @ ORGANIZATION1 from @ LOCATION1, I told my friends about the adventure we had and the difficult situation we found ourselves in. They laughed hysterically because they knew the girls. Laugh often to be happy.
"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @ CAPS1 best friend @ PERSON1. Wow! All of those good times last on @ DATE1 and all to come. Some people think it was weird but if you knew us you would understand. Sometimes people say, " I'm going to die laughing ." @ CAPS2 I know I'm because of @ PERSON1, she always knows how to make me laugh. If I had to count how many times we've laughed or done together, I might not have enough time or numbers to tell you how many times. First of all, this friendship started on @ DATE1, and now we're in second year @ DATE1 of high school. We've been friends for one @ DATE1 and eleven months and six days. We are the best of the best friends. So the last @ DATE1 when we were learning the cheers of the football season, almost every time we're done with a cheer, @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 and I would say, "@ CAPS3-in @ CAPS4." It was our saying, and we've always done it @ DATE1 and after football or basketball games. We called it our style @ CAPS3-in @ CAPS4 or for short our slogan. We would be having fun and laughing for hours. “@ CAPS5 turn, @ CAPS6 turn,” In @ DATE2, we were about to celebrate. On the drive to @ LOCATION1, every time we took a turn, we would say which turn it was and make a move with it. Oh @ CAPS1 my God we laughed and had a blast. After the @ CAPS6 and @ CAPS5 turns, there was another move that we called the monkey and we acted like monkeys. It was so much fun we laughed. We also laughed so much we cried and had to pee so hard it was almost really bad. This was one of the many car rides which was amazing. On the other hand, @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 and I clap together we have sleepovers, @ CAPS2 I should say we do everything together. She is @ CAPS1's sister and always will be, she is also @ CAPS1's best friend. I would do anything for her. I like @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1. In addition, we do everything together. When @ PERSON1 is at @ CAPS1 house, I always have to make sure to make sandwiches and orange juice. Because this time around we stayed awake after midnight and we were hungry so I went and did it all and @ PERSON1 loved it so now I have to make sure I get some for her when she comes. Now we're still talking about what will become of the sandwich habit; b we laugh about it all the time. Finally, @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 and I are going to be together forever, because I don't know what I would do without our sister @ CAPS1. I wouldn't be the person I am today without her and everything for me we laugh even when we want to cry she is everything for me. You could say that we have a perfect friendship all the time. @ CAPS1's best friend is @ CAPS1's sister I love you @ PERSON1, thanks for fetching @ CAPS1.
It was a day at @ DATE1, I was going to school. My friend @ PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me, but we always walked together to and from school. Well that day I decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and it was snowy. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I was saying something and I almost fell. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was quite funny because even at school I almost fell because the floors were wet with dried snow. I thought about walking home and changing my shoes, but I had to wait for lunch because I couldn't leave school by then or I would be in trouble. After the first period, I found a puddle and started to slide on it for fun. My friends tried to do it too, but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for the start of the second period and I walked over to my class. It was fun trying to go to class because I was crawling all over the place. Once I entered the classroom the teacher told me we were going to take a trip to the ponds. I was about to jump on it but the professor was walking right behind me. We got on the bus and started heading towards the ponds. My teacher called our names to make sure we were all there. He must have done this about every @ NUM1 minutes. It was pretty boring. The bus driver also played country music, I don't really mind country music, but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I got my iPod out of my pocket and found it wasn't there. I left it at my house as I rushed to school. We finally made it to the ponds and unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go too close to the ponds because if we fell in them we would get soaked and the bus driver would not let us get back on the bus. I thought he was just talking and asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so that we didn't get the seats wet. Again, I thought it was a bunch of bulls. We met our guide and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are for. As I walked around the ponds, I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed my friend so as not to fall but he had a pretty bad balance and we both fell. Everyone laughed as well as I did. My friend didn't find it too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joking that I couldn't stand. On the way back to school we talked about what we learned and if we would like to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work in the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slide all the time. We unloaded the bus again and headed for the school. I found that the small puddle I found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a good start and slipped on it. I did not fall this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last lesson of the day, which unfortunately for me was @ CAPS1. I went to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to play. He told me we were going up to the wrestling mats to play a game of dodge ball. Upstairs, on the wrestling mats, there was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I was very lucky because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats. I'm done with @ CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I put on my usual clothes and went home. My friend @ PERSON1 was waiting for me outside. We started to come home and I was sliding with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it to ice. I looked @ LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. All the way back, I was skating on the ice. It was a really fun day. Except just when I got home I fell on the bridge because the step was icy.
It was one of those days where I would just sit all day doing nothing but playing @ PERSON2, texting and laughing at myself. It was one of those days when nobody bothered me; no one even really spoke to me; no one told me to do chores. At dinner time someone decided to call me to eat but let me tell you it was not like pizza at all. Although I would rather eat it than be taught a lesson about not being grateful. My brother came home for the first time, ate with us, then decided to leave. But this time I asked to come with it; I'm so tired of beating @ PERSON2. He said no, rude. I made my daddy change his mind about him, from being rude. I don't see why he wouldn't let me come in the first place. He was going to hang out with the guys I grew up with, my friends, not his. In any event. I got ready and then we hit the road. He and I were there, laughing about dinner and the kind of music my mom listens to, on their way to pick up my friends. These guys are awesome! All we do is joke about each other and crack up. But let's get down to business. I didn't tell you, but it's time from @ DATE1, towards @ CAPS1 from @ DATE2. Fireworks are for sale and we make "bombs" out of them. Or they are. Since I was a girl I guess I don't have the right, or something lame like that. But there is this girl my brother loves and I guess he wants to impress her, excuse me for "impressing" her by showing up to her house so that she can see these "centerpieces" that they have. done. It just makes me feel bad for him, but honestly it made me laugh. She might be impressed. Key word: maybe. Although no, it won't. Because to this day, they're still just friends. So what about those bombs? Complete misfires. We tried, well, I just looked over and over again to get them to work, but they didn't do anything. Finally my friend @ CAPS2 put a whole bunch of @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 in my favorite stuffed animal. It was just a bunch of sparkling colors and loud noises, but it was quite fun to watch. We also participated in the video, it was a good laugh for everyone. After my brother said goodbye to his "daughter", we decided to go home. The thing is, we had so many fireworks left! We know this kid @ PERSON3 who lives somewhere on the way home. So we decided to walk past his house, get @ CAPS2 out of the truck, light the fireworks on his porch, pop him in the tail of the trunk, then leave as fast as we can. The first time we did it, we couldn't stop laughing. They didn't leave their homes, so we started over. They still haven't come out. We did it about once more, by then all the neighbors were out. They were all so confused. It made us laugh even more. It was so awesome that we wanted to keep doing it, but to someone else this time. We know this girl @ PERSON1 who lives near all of us. We thought, why not? It won't hurt to stop there real quick and have some fun with her too. Apparently she was thinking differently. Much different, in fact, she thought it was the grossest thing there was. We were just joking, laughing at our pleasure. We weren't rude, she's our friend. Long story short, her mother got angry too and chased us in her car. She never caught us, but she did get our license plate number. The next day, in @ CAPS1 of @ DATE2, she called the police. They thought it was okay, but they still showed up to my house and told my parents about what had happened. I was at my boyfriend's house so lucky I just had to talk to my mom on the phone. She realized we were just having fun and laughed about it too. This @ CAPS1 from @ DATE2 @ CAPS8 was awesome. It was one of those nights you laughed all the time and wouldn't change a thing, even if you were in trouble with the law for it. Something I definitely won't do again, but I'm so glad I have this hilarious memory that I will remember for the rest of my life.
A day with the family One day my cousin, her husband, my mom, my dad and I went out to eat at @ ORGANIZATION2 for breakfast. They had all grown up together, and telling stories about the good old days made them all want to go out more often. They always had fun @ CAPS2 together. I grew up with my cousins mostly. We were still hanging out. We started talking about all the crazy times we had, and it was nice to hear about the good old days. We were just laughing about a thunderstorm. All of a sudden out of @ CAPS1 where my cousin @ PERSON1 farts. We all start to laugh. @ PERSON1 continues to fart as she laughs uncontrollably. @ CAPS2 a lot of people were looking at us in the restaurant. Here is a group of people all laughing, and one of them keeps farting. The laughs got louder as did the farts. my mother couldn't take it anymore. She picked up one of the salt shakers and began to hammer it on the table. She wanted to muffle the sound of @ LOCATION1's farts. @ PERSON1 has been defeated in red. We were all laughing out loud @ CAPS2 we started to cry. We were almost at the point where we were going to pee. @ PERSON1 could no longer hold him back. She finally stopped farting, but now she had to pee @ CAPS2 because she couldn't even walk. When she got up to go to the bathroom, she must have walked there cross-legged and very slowly. The whole trip she was still laughing, and we were laughing too. We had fun watching her have to stop every @ CAPS2 often @ CAPS2 she wouldn't pee on herself. Once she stopped it was just on those two guy chairs. She was just standing there laughing, her legs crossed in front of these two guys doing her best not to pee. The guys really didn't do anything, they just sat there waiting for her to go. We could tell they were very uncomfortable though. I said to my mom "I would be uncomfortable if I had a random girl hunched over me laughing and trying not to pee. I'm surprised they didn't. moved. I would have done ". Finally @ PERSON1 went to the bathroom. These two guys were gone, and when she got out she was glad to see them gone. When we saw her, we couldn't help but laugh. She laughed with us @ CAPS2 we didn't feel bad laughing. People were still looking at us and @ PERSON1 was still blushing. She wanted to go to @ CAPS2, we left and talked about it all the way back. They came to our house to play boring games. When we got home, my brother joined us in a game of gestures. this game is a bit like sherades. We got into teams. I was on @ ORGANIZATION1 and my brothers' team. My brother went first. It started to melt to the ground. I scream "wicked witch of the west"! He frowns and says, "@ CAPS1, look before you yell things." @ CAPS2 I sat there and watched. It started to melt again, but when it got to the ground it started to roll and shake. I was confused @ CAPS2. My cousins scream "shit"! My brother is screaming "@ CAPS3, why would anyone want to poop" ! We all start to laugh, and he just tells us what he is. He was a waterfall. It was my turn to go, and I rode a horse. I didn't want to be a horse. I didn't even know I was a quiet horse. I went up there and started to hope like a fool. I felt @ CAPS2 stupid. My teammates made me feel even worse because they couldn't guess what I was for the life of them. The buzzer sounded and we lost the game by two points. My brother hates to lose. He got really angry and ran up the stairs. On the way up, he stumbles over his face and falls down the stairs. We all started to laugh, and that made my brother even crazier. He walked up the stairs without falling this time, and stayed in his room the rest of @ TIME1. The rest of us stayed downstairs and played more games. It was a really fun day. I had the opportunity to go out with the family and have a good laugh. going out with the family is something everyone should love. It's one of those things that makes you feel good.
Laughter is important, we all know that. It makes life easier, happier, and even helps you live longer. It is also very important for relationships. When we talk about preference in others, it's often that people mention that they want someone who can make them laugh, which is why. this story is, however, not about dating. It's about how laughter can take you from hating someone to being their best friend the next day. I had known @ PERSON1 for quite some time for a few months at this point, I had met him on the bus. He was pale, thin, loud, and he always had something funny and offensive to say. He was locked up. Before I met @ PERSON1 I could do it, but I just couldn't stand it. I remember one day, the day I went from hating him to being friends, we were arguing over something so trivial I can't remember what it was. Even though I remember what he said. He said I was a "hypocritical, arrogant asshole who would make funny jokes at other people's expense, but who would stand up in someone's face if they tried one on me." that made me laugh. Not because everything he said was right, but because it made me realize that @ PERSON1 was actually a really good guy whose only real problem was he didn't know when to shut up. Throughout the time that I have known @ PERSON1 he never stopped smiling. He laughs at everything from walking in doggy shit to his father's drug addiction, he can ease the pain of any hit with laughter. @ PERSON1 is my constant reminder to never stop laughing.
Laughter is good for everyone. @ CAPS1 helps the body to be more aroused, believe it or not, @ CAPS1 is an exercise for the body. Laughter cleanses the body when people are really stressed. @ CAPS1 is like a remedy for the body and also, laughter is not only good for you, but also when others see you @ CAPS1, it also gives another person the courage to do the same.
Laughter is a @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 have been there, I know @ CAPS4 have. We all have. @ CAPS4 was that kid who just didn't want to help your nagging parent. Especially when your dad had been in a huge motorcycle wreck and @ CAPS4 had been waiting hand and foot for him the whole visit there. @ CAPS10 had had a few surgeries and received numerous medications for @ CAPS2. I had noticed that @ CAPS10 was not really himself on all of these pills. His anomaly was wreaking havoc in the family. Through all of these stressful times, we were also worried about Stepmom @ CAPS6. She was pregnant with her second child. There was also the stress that the fathers business @ CAPS6 was the main income and he could not work. @ CAPS6's dad felt helpless, his leg was too weak for him to do anything. @ CAPS10 would micromanage everything and tell @ CAPS4 that things were wrong. It was starting to cause a lot of tension in the house. Today was the day. Isabelle (@ CAPS6 little sister) and I stayed alone with @ CAPS6 with daddy for the first time. I was going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project we were doing in the @ CAPS6 room. The dad asked me if I could make him some oatmeal, of course with both hands, I said "@ CAPS5, but I'll do it when I'm done." @ CAPS6's dad took this as disrespectful and hobbled towards me on his crutches. @ CAPS10 was yelling at me which was upsetting, so instead of fighting back I walked over to the @ CAPS6 room. The anger in his voice was excruciating. I turned around, told him to stop yelling and walked back to the @ CAPS6 room. That's when it happened. @ CAPS6 father hung the end of a small children's chair and threw it in the hallway. He bounced off the walls, smashing an exit shell, punching a hole in the wall and hitting the knee @ CAPS6. I didn't say anything, being afraid of what would happen next. Luckily slamming the door I had the phone and called grandma @ CAPS6. I told her over voicemail that I wanted her to come pick me up and take me home. She arrived an hour later not knowing that I had left a voicemail message. I explained what had happened and she comforted @ CAPS6's sister and me by telling us that everything would be fine. @ CAPS6 grandma sat us all in the living room trying to resolve the situation. By this time, @ CAPS6's dad had come to his senses and apologized to both of us. @ CAPS10 used popcorn and candy to make us forgive, then @ CAPS10 started to laugh and joke. Whenever there is a fight or a disagreement @ CAPS6, dad always makes a few jokes to put us in a better mood. The only thing different this time is that after @ CAPS10 told jokes, @ CAPS10 apologized again. This time explaining why @ CAPS10 was sorry. I liked what made the rest of the day a joy. "@ CAPS7 made laughter a drug @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, @ NUM1 minutes of laughter equals two hours of @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3." @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 on a service @ DATE1 talked about it. Laughter can really mend a broken heart. The @ CAPS2 that sister @ CAPS6 and I went through that day was over after the @ CAPS6 laugh the dad gave us. "Laughter can save us." @ CAPS10 also stated. After this day, I believe that with a little humor @ CAPS6 father and relationship I can go through anything. I would never let an error control a lifelong link. Laughter will always be in our hearts.
Laughter plays an important role in relationships, @ CAPS1 also promotes pleasure and can be a pursuit of happiness. Every time I laugh, it's either because I'm really having fun or because I'm just having a good time. A lot of people don't have a very good sense of humor and don't laugh at things that are funny, every time I watch a funny movie that I like I sit and wait for the really funny parts, but don't get me wrong, remember not to laugh too hard as you might get your pants wet by accident or who knows if you laugh loud enough you might even shoot a "whotammy" and trust me that didn't not looking nice and then you will be embarrassed in front of everyone. My favorite comedian is Adam Sandler because he's very funny and has a good sense of humor, he knows how to make a person laugh and get them interested in his comedy shows and movies. funny but @ CAPS1 was good. My second favorite comedian is @ PERSON1 because he's a little funnier than Adam Sandler, but not as good, although he also stars in a TV show called Wild'n out, this show almost makes me cough out my lungs, especially when they burst with your mommy jokes @ CAPS1 makes you laugh and gets blood flowing through your body. so we all understand very well what laughter is but most people dont really seem to laugh at things that are funny i cant stop understanding @ CAPS1 but i guess they dont have common sense humor, but some people seem to laugh at things that don't even make sense, I stop, I don't understand either, but I guess it's better to laugh than not to laugh at all. Some really good comedy movies that I can mention right off the bat that will keep you tuned in and laughing for more than half of the movies are grandma's boy, merry gillmore, don't be a threat to the south-central while sipping my juice. Plus zombie land @ CAPS1 is a hell of a good movie, i sure its not just about making a funny movie just to make the audience laugh @ CAPS1 is the way they do @ CAPS1 and how they act and how good the backstory is comedy movies will be what I'll pay attention to every time I sit down and inspect what makes the movie funny too if I can't understand a funny movie I see @ CAPS1 over and over until I understand what is so scary about @ CAPS1. This covers a lot of the basics of laughter, there is your basics and what you need to know about @ CAPS1 and how to take advantage of @ CAPS1 and use @ CAPS1 wisely because remember not to laugh too much because you don't want to end up pulling a "whotammy" in front of everyone around thanks for reading my review.
Laughter is the cure for an illness and the cure for someone's pain. Laughter can mend a friendship so that two strangers become best friends. A person can ask anyone on the street how important laughter is in life and they will say laughter is very important. It's like love, everyone needs it in their life and like laughter it helps a person grow and become an adult. A person can use laughter to help them with anything, like finding a job, trying to get the girl, or just having a good time and making new friends. It is one of the main parts of life that makes a person who they are and what they do. In @ DATE1, I was introduced to a girl named @ DATE3, by my cousin @ PERSON1. She started talking to me and I was shy because she was a girl and I wasn't used to talking to girls. I made a joke and it made him laugh together and it was the first icebreaker to make a new friend for me. The days went by and we were texting each other on the phone every day, making jokes about how our day had been and making jokes on each other. Finally, we started talking to each other on the phone. Nowadays, teens don't usually use the phone to call people, which makes it hard to understand emotions because talking via text message masks each other's emotions. @ DATE3 called me and we were chatting until late in @ TIME1, where we would both fall asleep and leave the phone on, and again, we would always make jokes about everything. Making each other laugh was one of our only connections since she had gone to another school. Making her happy was what I had to do, and one of the ways to make her happy was to make her laugh or just be a lovely young man because I was raised that way. @ DATE2 formal was approaching and I needed an appointment. @ DATE3 was my best option for a date as I got closer to her and started to bond with her. When I had the chance I asked her to be my date for the formal @ DATE2 which would be one of the most special nights of my freshman year. The day of the ceremony arrived and we danced the @ TIME1 and sure enough I had to make some jokes about other things that made everyone laugh and have a good time. Towards the end of the dance, I asked her to be my girlfriend and she agreed. She said I was funny and sweet and cute which was good. We had a great time because good humor and fun kept @ TIME1 alive. The next formal @ DATE2 the same happened with a different girl except laughter was an important key and that made @ TIME1 so much fun. This @ TIME1 was one of the best nights of my life I have ever had, because we were laughing and having the best @ TIME1 ever. Laughter is an important key in my life. I would never have had the girl or I would have had the best @ TIME1 of my life if laughter had never been involved. Laughter makes everything better and I use it in my everyday life because everyone needs a good laugh if they are in a bad mood. Without laughing my life would be dull and would have no color that would make me who I am today. It is one of the many keys to life that everyone needs to be happy, and without it you would be less happy than you are now. A small child might go through his entire childhood without laughing or any other important part of his life and he might end up being a mean and cruel person who doesn't understand the right values and humor. Everyone needs personality and color in their life and without it everything is gray. Life is like a coloring book and without someone or something to color them with, it's just pointless.
I had a great time with my grandfather. He is a very funny and loving man. When my cousin, my grandfather and I get together for a camping trip, it's hard to come no matter what. A few years ago he took me and my cousin on a two day camping trip along @ ORGANIZATION1. The first campground we arrived at did not have any open pitches, so we moved on to the next campground. Campsite @ CAPS1 had tons of open campsites so we picked the best we could find and stayed there for the first @ TIME1. Later that evening we learned why there was no one at the campsite. The reason was that there had been a raccoon problem a few days before and people were afraid to stay in the campsite for fear of being attacked or having their food stolen. We were lucky and never saw the raccoon and never lost our food. The next @ TIME2 on our way out, we saw a sign that said " Attention Raccoon Problem ". @ CAPS1 made us laugh all the way to @ LOCATION1, which is a small town on @ ORGANIZATION1. Once at @ LOCATION1, we pulled over to get gas and more food to last until @ TIME1. While we were at the gas station we had a little problem but it was very funny. A young blonde woman came to help us and she was not the smartest person I have met. She charged us three times the amount of gasoline we bought and couldn't tell us where the nearest grocery store was. Well, as my grandpa rolls up his window, he mutters quite loudly "stupid blonde" as the woman just stood there. She didn't say a word and my grandfather left with me and my cousin laughing so hard we could barely breathe. My grandpa asked us why we were laughing so hard, so we told him what the circumstances were when he said stupid blonde. He was so oblivious to the situation that he didn't notice what came out of his mouth at the time. What made him even better was that he left as if nothing had happened. The next @ TIME1 we stayed at a different campsite without raccoons. Always @ TIME1 was filled with laughter. We were roasting marshmallows on the fire after our dinner and for some strange reason my grandpa couldn't keep the marshmallow on his stick. He wasted about six marshmallows before he even had one he could eat. And every time he threw one in the fire, it just got more and more funny. We laughed and laughed until our stomachs hurt. The best part was my grandpa didn't think it was funny so he just looked at me and my cousin like we were stupid or something. In the tent where @ TIME1 we were so tired, everything seemed funny to us. We laughed at each other until two in @ TIME2. It was then that everything became silent and we could no longer hold out. We all fell asleep within seconds. My cousin and I have been camping with my grandpa every year for about four years and every year we have a laughter filled adventure getting closer to each other. My grandfather is a great man and I admire him for a lot of things in my life. He always made me laugh and I try to do the same for him. He and I think it's important to laugh together because it keeps you smiling and helps you get closer to who you are. Keep laughing and have fun in whatever you do.
"Laughter" I believe that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. When things between you and a loved one get blurry, making them laugh will always help break the ice. When I'm mad at my boyfriend he knows that in order for me to be happy he has to make me smile / laugh. This is exactly what he does. The very first time he made me angry he didn't know what to do. It was @ DATE1 @ CAPS1 and I had just started dating. I remember him asking me if I was hungry and I said “no I'm not hungry” so he kept asking me. Since we had only been dating for a short time, he really didn't know much about me, so he didn't know that I was a type of girl who got angry easily and that I had a very low temper. He kept asking me if I was hungry, thirsty, bored or tired but didn't realize that at this point I was really bored; an hour and a half passed and he was still asking! I was going crazy, didn't want to tell him how I felt because I knew I was going to make him feel bad, but I thought to myself and said "no he must know because it's gonna be worse if later in the relationship he has to find out what i like and what i don't like on his own rather than me telling him. has exploded and told me why i dont was not fair with him from the start. It really pissed me off, I tried to be honest with him before something worse happened, but I guess not. I was silent the longest and he kept asking me "what's wrong", "tell me what i did wrong" so i told him that got me really pissed off the way he was. 'had turned on me for no reason really all I was trying to do was save us from a bigger argument, he looked at me and said I had done something wrong! He said that we were already together since is two months and it took me so long to show him my true colors, I kind of understood where he was coming from but at the same time I didn't agree because at that moment he should have known that already. I mean it doesn't take that long to get to know a person, especially if it's your girlfriend. In the end, we just agreed that we need to be ourselves around each other. He burst out saying "Ouch Charlie, you bit me" with an accent of @ CAPS2 that made me lose my mind. I laughed for days after that and completely forgot about you during the overwhelming discussion we had. The point is, laughter is the tool for breaking the ice when the going gets tough and it doesn't have to be a loved one, it can even be a complete stranger, if the person is shy, making her laugh will help build a great friendship with them. You can make anyone's day go smoothly with just a little smile on their face, a simple "hello" or "hello" can even make them smile. I believe that a person who smiles often lives longer. This @ MONTH1 is not true, but in my small world it is. I'm all about smiling, all about making people laugh. Honestly, I hate to see people walking around with angry faces like they don't have any friends when all they really want is someone to make them smile - and that would be me. ! In conclusion, if it hadn't been for the laughter, what relationship would still be standing at this point ? None, because if you always argue, always win, and never laugh, then how do you think your relationship will last ? Like I said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."
Angelina @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 a year ago, sometime in @ DATE2, I was at my best friend @ PERSON1 for a slumber party after her @ CAPS3 party. We were exhausted from swimming in @ CAPS4's pool and taking your dog for a walk, not to mention the party, and we would have fallen asleep without @ CAPS5's family bag and the six pack @ ORGANIZATION1 we only had not consumed an hour ago. Around three o'clock @ TIME1, with our childish minds looking for something to do, we decided it was a good idea to paint the tips of our tongues blue with nail polish in the hope that they would glow in the dark. black when held with the black light on. his window sill. I was the first one bold enough to brush my tongue, and it hurt ! The acid and alcohol in the varnish stung my taste buds. The next day was @ DATE1 and after spending the afternoon at @ LOCATION1 we came to my house for another sleepover which we have and sometimes still do whenever we're together. That night, this time around 2am @ TIME1, we got hungry again and went down for a snack before heading back to my room and @ PERSON1 playing on my computer while I used his phone to text to my old crush. @ PERSON1 had jars or ice water, still not sure why she uses jars instead of cups, interrupted my tour of the kitchen floor with my new socks, and we had a blowing contest instant random ice cream. After ten seconds of silence, I glanced over my pot at @ LOCATION1, who wasn't even half done with his water. There on her chin was a stain, a dot, a ball of blue nail polish. I tried to gasp to give myself enough air to start laughing at her, but instead of air entering my windpipe, an ice cube made its way. Choking, laughing, falling down, laughing, picking nail polish, and more laughing, we were in the middle of the kitchen with nothing to laugh about, it was so funny. @ PERSON1 dropped his pot and shattered on the floor, sending shards of glass and water through the kitchen, but that's okay. We were having fun and, guess what, we fell asleep on the kitchen floor less than ten minutes later. I guess we were more tired than we thought. We cleaned the glass though. Some people say that laughter is the best medicine a doctor can use, that it can cure any disease, that it can brighten up anyone's day. Apprentice dentists use laughing gas which drives people crazy and smile a lot when they do operations on your teeth, and it doesn't hurt as much, until the next day, but that's because you just got pulled out a tooth. Today @ PERSON1 and I are still best friends. Of course we fight, but they end in a week or two. The longest fight we've ever been in lasted a month and a half, and it was a misunderstood rumor that another friend of mine started, and ended with the both of us laughing @ CAPS2 at what point what happened was really stupid. In the five or six years that @ PERSON1 and I were friends, we have come to realize that laughing is healthy and good for you, both physically and emotionally for stress relieving, so every time we see each other we laugh as much as possible. Inside jokes popping up from something unrelated, a funny looking person walking by the side of the road, or just our own minds saying it's time to be happy again, it all triggers laughter. Sometimes it hurts, but you can't help but laugh louder, because it's fun.
Once upon a time, on a late rainy night, my friends @ PERSON2 I decided that @ CAPS5 would be fun to go out into the woods @ PERSON2 play @ NUM1-go-seek. One of my friend's sisters drove us into the woods @ PERSON2 the idea of the game was that since there were four of us two would come out @ PERSON2 hide @ PERSON2 tow would stay in the car @ PERSON2 count until the other two were ready to be found. Well, one time, while the four of us were doing this, @ CAPS5 was pouring rain @ PERSON2 very very muddy outside. Well the two hiding were @ PERSON2 @ PERSON2 @ PERSON1 @ PERSON2 the two who stayed in the car to count were my friend @ PERSON3 @ PERSON2 I. Before @ PERSON2 @ PERSON2 @ PERSON1 went out to hide we have all signaled to let others know if we were doing well or not. The danger signal was @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1. @ CAPS3 after our little reunion @ PERSON2 took care of everything that was @ PERSON2, @ PERSON1 got out of the car @ PERSON2 went from @ PERSON2 hid while me @ PERSON2 @ PERSON3 stayed in the car to wait @ PERSON2 count. After counting to about @ NUM2, we hear @ PERSON2 screaming. My first thought was that they had just had chicken @ PERSON2 maybe wanted to panic @ PERSON3 @ PERSON2 I. I was curious @ CAPS3 I opened the car door @ CAPS3 I can hear this a little better they said. Of course, here is the @ PERSON1 @ PERSON2 rite behind it was @ PERSON2. @ PERSON2 felt like @ CAPS4 was about to cry @ PERSON2 @ PERSON2 couldn't run fast enough to get back to the car, @ CAPS4 kept sliding @ PERSON2 was sliding all over the road but @ CAPS4 had finally made it back @ CAPS5 @ PERSON2 @ PERSON1 @ PERSON2 @ PERSON2 crammed into the car with us. We were all sitting there, crammed into that little car thinking what they were running from @ PERSON2 shouting, @ CAPS3 me being the bravest right now, I decided to go take a look at things . Of course, with @ PERSON2 who doesn't want to look or feel like wimps was following me closely. As I walked down the road from where I saw them run from @ LOCATION1 jump in front of me @ PERSON2 says "right over there I swear I saw something cross the road!" @ CAPS3 I walked over to where @ CAPS4 reported that @ PERSON2 looked around thinking @ ORGANIZATION1 is crazy @ PERSON2 @ CAPS4 is just seeing things. But as I walk, @ PERSON2 grabs me from behind @ PERSON2 yells. I turn around @ PERSON2 looking at her thinking "what's wrong with you people !" @ CAPS4 grabs me by the arm @ PERSON2 looks up with a very scared expression on his face. I turn to her @ PERSON2 asks her "what's wrong" @ CAPS4 asks me, "why does that tree look white but right there in the middle there is a big tan spot ?!" @ CAPS5 was dark @ PERSON2 I couldn't see very well but when I looked up I saw exactly what @ PERSON2 was panicking about. I go back to the car to get a flashlight, hoping that I can come and see what is on the tree a little better @ PERSON2 as soon as I return to @ PERSON2 near the tree, @ ORGANIZATION1 lets out a bloodcurdling scream @ PERSON2 shouts "@ CAPS6 ! It's moving, whatever @ CAPS5 is @ CAPS5 is moving @ CAPS7 !" @ CAPS3 as I approach the girls @ PERSON2 snatches the flash light from my hands, turn on @ CAPS5 on @ PERSON2 point @ CAPS5 towards the tree. Sure enough, there was a big stain of tan @ PERSON2 on the white tree. As we girls sat waiting for @ CAPS5 to move again, @ CAPS5 finally did. I flashed @ CAPS5 with the flash @ PERSON2 started laughing. As soon as @ PERSON2 gets their feet under them, they want to hit me because they don't know what's in the tree or what I was laughing at. As they approach me, I turn to @ PERSON1 @ PERSON2 and ask "@ CAPS3 @ PERSON2, do you want to see your monster?" @ CAPS4 freaked out again asking what it was. I told him, "take a look at @ CAPS5 for yourself" @ CAPS4 looked up @ PERSON2 saw @ CAPS5 ... A large brown paper bag that was blown by the wind. As soon as I saw @ CAPS4 say @ CAPS5, I told @ PERSON2 what @ CAPS5 was @ PERSON1 his @ PERSON2 I started laughing out loud about @ PERSON1 @ PERSON2 his "hideous monster". Once I burst out laughing at @ PERSON2 we all got back to the car where @ PERSON3 was waiting @ PERSON2 we drove off. Since that night @ PERSON2, @ PERSON2 @ PERSON2 I will never forget that night in the woods. Whenever we think of @ CAPS5 we all start to laugh @ PERSON2 while making fun of each other for being afraid of a brown paper bag.
For me, laughter makes the world go round. It is much needed to keep the world light and filled with a session of happiness. You will hardly pass me without a big old smile plastered on my face. There are so many stores to choose from, but @ TIME1 will be the most fun to tell, I think. It always makes me laugh just thinking about it @ TIME1. I was going on a trip with my last boyfriend, @ PERSON1, up to @ LOCATION1 for the fourth of @ DATE1. They have a great shift of @ DATE1 and I was lucky enough to be able to go with him and his mom with him. We wear staying with her mom's good friends @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2. The house was incredibly amazing, beautiful wood floors, a large open living room combined with the kitchen and dining area, vaulted ceilings and a stunning large window that framed @ CAPS3. @ CAPS4. Even though the house is so great, my favorite part is the running rails. No more than a quarter of a mile through a small path surrounded by woods carries two sets of tracks stretching back and forth @ CAPS5 far @ CAPS5 that the eye could see. My favorite part of the trip to the hole is wearing these trails. This was the second @ TIME1 of our stay at @ LOCATION1 around @ NUM1 hours. @ PERSON1 and I for a walk in the refreshing @ TIME1. We could barely see each other and hold onto each other to try and keep balance. Smiling and laughing we finally tripped out of the trail entrance very well hidden on the trails. Hand in hand we began to walk the tracks enjoying each other's gifts. In @ CAPS4 the stars are the most amazing I have ever seen. I don't know why, but the sky seems to open up and look twice as big as it is. @ TIME1 @ TIME1 was perfect for stargazing without a cloud in sight. So we decided to lie down between the slopes and watch the stars. There we huddled together for a good @ NUM2 minuets. Then @ PERSON1 looked up. I gave him a puzzled expression and then followed his gaze to see what had turned him on. In the distance, there was a light. Slowly progressing t words use. Of course, it was a train at @ NUM1 o'clock at @ TIME1. Looking at each other we both laughed at the sheer surprise of a train at @ TIME1. @ CAPS5 the train moved forward, we jumped off and out of the tracks to wait for it to pass so we could get back to our seats. The train was going much slower than I expected. No more than @ NUM4 to @ NUM5 miles per hour. @ PERSON1's eyes lit with an idea and not thinking he said "We should jump on it!" @ CAPS5 soon @ CAPS5 the words left his mouth, he regretted having said them. I thought it was a great idea! But he desperately tried to convince me not to. I walked over to the track telling him to live a little and have fun. I had never jumped a train before, but at first glance the @ TIME1 train was perfect for trying it out. There, wear long, flat ball cars with little latest practices on each. I dressed for one and jumped right before @ PERSON1 could stop me. He finally gave in and jumped on the next one. We wear both a smile and a good @ TIME1 when we hopped and met in a hug. Then the train stopped. We froze. Then a light started to come towards us. Panicked, for sure thinking we would be in trouble, I sprinted to the trailhead with @ PERSON1 near my heels. I couldn't find the trail and the light was getting closer so we both jumped at full speed straight into a big pile of bushes. There, we stood perfectly still, let's say the light passed us and the train started to resize its pace. I met @ PERSON1's big smile and we both rocked out laughing without being able to stop ourselves. Enough to increase the chances of going out for a simple walk and everything @ TIME1 is going on. Still smiling, @ PERSON1 leans towards me and kisses me perfectly. It was one of my best nights. @ TIME1 is just one example of how smiling and laughing was a big part of @ PERSON1 and I in our relationship. Love, friends, and laughter are the reason life is worth living.
Being able to laugh is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Having family to share with is priceless. Family moments like this are moments that no one can take away. They will be there for you to look back and just smile on those days. Not being able to laugh would make this world dull and very depressing. Laughter is the main bond between family and friends. My family and I decided that for our @ DATE1 break, we would be heading to the great country of @ LOCATION1. None of us @ CAPS1 how to get there, but my mom told us she would find out and we weren't worried. So the day we were released from school, my mom packed us up and we left. After two long hours of driving, we finally made it to @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. The crowd to walk through was huge. On the boat to cross, I thought about going up some stairs to see where we were at. There it was @ LOCATION2. Once we got off the boat and walked through the crowded @ LOCATION2 freeways, we started crossing the @ LOCATION2 / @ CAPS4 border. I noticed my mom had a weird look on her face, a worried look. My sister asked her if she @ CAPS1 what she was doing, she replied "a little". After hours and hours of driving, my mom thought it would be a good idea to buy a card. When we looked at the map we noticed a small town which was very close. When we arrived my mom said we would stay here for the night. When we all woke up, my mom told us that she remembered that the city we were staying in was the city we were supposed to be in. After walking around town looking for our hotel, we were all in the room to rest from the driving. My sister commented to my mom, how funny it was to watch her drive and act like she @ CAPS1 what she is doing. It made us all laugh. We all started making random comments about his excellent sailing skills. The rest of the trip we drove laughing and telling my mom don't get lost this time and ask for directions if you need to. Laughing at us getting lost made the trip truly unforgettable. Being able to laugh is the greatest feeling in the world. Doing this as a family is a great way to remember fun times. Not laughing could make this life horrible and boring. Being with family and going through a negative situation and making it the best vacation ever with laughter is really priceless. Everyone needs a laugh in their life, because you only live once, so make it worth it.
Laughter brings the world together in a way that cannot be put into words. When two people laugh together about the same thing, a special bond is formed that is unlike any other. There is no way to describe the connection and how it can build a relationship. Everyone on this @ LOCATION2 will hopefully experience the bond that laughter makes. The last @ DATE2, I was a member of a selected lacrosse team and didn't know any of the girls there. The team had five practices before the tournament and by the third practice I still hadn't spoken to a lot of the girls there. I was too shy to talk to these girls who all seemed to have a friend with them on the team. At the fourth practice, we were all stretching in a circle and I commented to one of the girls and she laughed. We started talking and during the rest of this practice we talked and became friends. By making her laugh, I had made a friend on the team and was even more excited for the upcoming tournament. Final training was cut short so the team could create tie-dye t-shirts to wear during the tournament. I sat down with @ PERSON2, the girl I had become friends with in the previous practice, and her friend @ PERSON1 came to sit with us on the concrete. We all started to talk and laugh with each other. Our shirts were tied with rubber bands and we were ready to dye them. We were laughing and spoiling the multiple colors, having fun and enjoying the hot night. As we finished our shirts and put the wet clothes in plastic bags, we made our way to the parking lot and said goodbye. I now had two friends on the team and couldn't wait to leave for the tournament this @ DATE1. On @ DATE1 @ TIME1, I woke up at @ NUM1 am to meet the team at a park in @ LOCATION1, OR. We were all gathered there to load our things into the three big white vans and to form a team. I crawled into the van wearing my tie-dye t-shirt to see some of the girls who looked tired and were also wearing the tie-dye shirts. @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 were in the back with another girl between them, so I sat in the row in front of them. Other girls from the team piled into the van and we were on our way. During the @ NUM2 @ NUM3 hour car ride, we slept, laughed and told stories. After being stuck in the car together for so long, we have all bonded to each other through laughter and storytelling. We each came from different cities, schools and backgrounds, which made for a very entertaining car ride. At the tournament, @ PERSON1, @ PERSON2 and I all stayed together. We walked in the fields, ate and laughed together most of the time. The only time we were separated was when roommates were assigned and we weren't put in a room together. We all worked together as a team towards a common goal of winning matches and reaching the championship. All of the girls on this team bonded in one way or another and even now most of us are still in touch with each other. Laughter is what brought @ PERSON2 and me together and the rest of the team followed. The whole team bonded with laughter and we all became more comfortable with each other laughing and having a good time. Bringing together @ NUM4 girls from entirely different cities could have been a major disaster, but we connected with each other making others laugh, making it a positive experience for everyone involved. Laughter is really the shortest distance between two people. Connecting with another human through laughter is an experience everyone should have, it is so unique and powerful that friendships based on laughter can last a lifetime. Laughter makes the world a little better, a little brighter and more united.
Humor is a big part of who I am and I love making people laugh, but this story is about an event that made my whole family fall to the floor laughing. It all started with a @ DATE1 when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day not only for him but also for the rest of us kids as we could all play it whenever we wanted. We were always at my cousins after that. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest lap. Sometimes we would fall or one of us got hurt and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play on it for a while, but they always gave in and let us get back on it. It wasn't until a few months later that we all witnessed the funniest crash none of us had ever seen in our lives. It all started at my aunt's birthday party. Usually she had it in a fancy restaurant, but not this year, this year she decided to have it at home to save money. So we all show up to my aunts, my mother, my brothers and me party. First of all, we do all the usual things for birthday, reuniting family members, eating food, and singing happy birthday. Basically to me it was all boring stuff. I mean, come on, there was a trampoline in the back yard just waiting to be jumped up, but the adults wouldn't let us get near it until we had eaten. Finally, everyone had finished eating and they were going to let the children have fun. It started out as normal as any other day we went out to play on the trampoline, but we didn't know all our stomachs would hurt us laughing within a few hours of an event that was about to happen .
It was a normal day, I had just woken up as my friend @ PERSON2 called me to ask if I wanted to go out. I said yes and went for a shower and got ready. Once I was ready, I called him back and asked him where he wanted to go out. He told me he wanted me to go to Kyle House and play basketball. When I got there everyone was there so we decided to have a big game of basketball. I was in the best team and I already knew we were going to win. but I missed every shot I took and it was really embarrassing but my team ended up winning which was no surprise. After the game we were all tired and went inside to play video games. We played @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ NUM1, we took turns playing and in my turn I played really bad because I don't really play video games, so everyone's playing is made fun of me including myself As soon as we finished playing I got a @ CAPS1 from a bunch of girls who were going to the movies that night and wanted to know if everyone and me wanted to go. Everyone decided to go, and we all wanted to see the movie Paranormal Activity @ NUM1 so we were pretty excited and before the movie started we all went to @ PERSON1's house and spent some time with it. all the girls. We all sat in the living room listening to music while most of the girls were up the stairs getting ready. I was bored so I went up the stairs to hang out with the girls and let tell me that was a bad idea because the second I got up there they all wanted me to let them straighten my hair or put on makeup. So I went back down the stairs and warned everyone not to go up there. They asked me why and when I told them they all laughed and some of them got up there anyway and I came back with makeup on, laughed so hard I fell off the couch. Once I finally stopped laughing it was time to go and her mom drove us there but there weren't enough seats in the car so me and all the girls piled up in the front seat and the rest of the guys were in the back seat, so I was pretty happy. When we entered the movie theater there was quite a long line but it was worth it. it made me jump five times. When we got home it was like @ NUM3 and @ PERSON3 and I walked home from her house and all the way back he was panicking and it made me laugh and it made her laugh like j was a little I panicked too. I think it was a really fun day because I laughed most of it.
@ CAPS1 is my personal belief that hilarity and dizziness are the best emotional states. Therefore, @ CAPS1 makes sense that people who find laughter in the same things are good relationships. @ CAPS1 is because of their similarity of mind that they are connected and find happiness in each other's company. My story is an example of the bond of laughter between people and the strength of the bond that forms @ CAPS1. Imagine the scene : @ CAPS1 was @ DATE2 on the north side of @ CAPS2. Hooded under the infamous snow dome. Standing there was a weak eleven year old boy who thought he couldn't go any further. Beside him patiently stood his father, a rock climbing veteran who had scaled mountains at @ LOCATION1 and @ LOCATION2. The boy was tired, he couldn't put one foot in front of the other. His muscles roared in protest as the blisters on his heels throbbed in harmony. The sun of @ DATE1 hit him as the snow gave way and brought him to the ground. @ CAPS1 was like the mountain wanted him to fail and urged him to give in and mourn his defeat. Fatigue then consumed the boy adding fifty pounds to each of his limbs. His brain had darkened as well, leaving him capable of only simple thoughts like stepping aside in front of the other. He started to find any excuse to stop and did them often. The boy's father had done everything he could to get his son to continue in vain. He tried another tactic, he started telling the boy stories, maybe in the hope that @ CAPS1 would take the boy's mind out of excruciating pain. And to the relief of all concerned, @ CAPS1 has proven to be effective. What was most interesting about the whole event was that @ CAPS1 was not the content of the stories that helped, @ CAPS1 was the humorous and sarcastic tone that made the real difference. An infusion that I would describe as a laughing gas solution and an energy drink overwhelmed me. In the presence of my father's humor, I found the strength to continue. @ CAPS1 felt like I had been fully recharged and refreshed. My arms and leg, which previously looked like solid lead pipes, have become considerably lighter. The throbbing agony in my muscles and joints frayed and was gone. The muffled pulses of the bulbs on my heels have died down. It was all due to the thoughts and ideas of someone tickling my funny bone. I believe that laughter is nature's anesthetic, the emotional element that keeps the world sane. @ CAPS1 was at this point where I realized what I respected most in my father. I had no shortage of traits to choose from. He had an indomitable work ethic, was an excellent teacher, and possessed extraordinary energy. But what I respected most about him was that we were similar in our humor. We laughed at the same things and found each other's comments hilarious. @ CAPS1 has forged a strong bond between us, a bond built of euphoria and joy that continues to this day. Whenever I'm moody he always manages to find a way to make me smile and I've found that I have the same ability. In my opinion, a relationship based on laughter is the strongest of all. Laughter is a force that paves the way for friendship, respect and love. You can't have hope for a better future if you don't have to laugh. @ CAPS1 is the drug that comes down from the sky. A drug that circulates in the blood of society. In the process of freeing minds from stress and worry about what tomorrow will bring. Laughter can unite a population and instill a sense of friendship in a society. Have you ever laughed at something and then turned around to find that at the same time someone across the room had started laughing as well. Then your eyes lock up and a slow smile spreads across both of your faces, as you realize that you are not alone in the way you think and laugh. This connecting force is the result of the power of laughter.
Laugh, smirk, laugh, @ CAPS1 chuckling ; it all has to do with a subject, @ CAPS1, ie laughing. Laughter is everywhere, you hear it in libraries, parks, at home, behind your back, @ CAPS1 it can be a good thing or a horrible thing in @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS1 even with family @ CAPS1 friends. Everyone has a history of laughing that welcomed, helped, encouraged, or even, just so they could make a very special friend who will stay with them forever. It was the start of a whole new @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS1 that I had just moved from @ LOCATION2. I was in seventh grade about to start @ ORGANIZATION1 at @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS1 wasn't a big fan of hanging out with people so I was left alone most of the weeks having lunch in the guidance center , trying to figure out where the books where without talking to anyone. My schedule was good, I had a choir, art, theater, you know everything I love. The Art @ CAPS1 drama was awesome, but when it comes to choir singing @ CAPS1, my social level went down. I love to sing, but I've never done it in front of people. Then one day I was walking towards the choir @ CAPS1 I tripped @ CAPS1 fell, my papers fell with me. My job @ ORGANIZATION1 was everywhere, math on one side, science on the other. But, of all the children in the hallway, only one laughed. She walked past @ CAPS1 and said I had done a great job, but something made her come back. She helped me pick up all my math homework @ CAPS1 picked up my schedule @ CAPS1 saw that she too had a choir this time. Her name was @ PERSON1, she told me, @ CAPS1 I told her my name, @ CAPS1 we walked together. We sat next to each other @ CAPS1 I sang with her our voices in harmony. We talked between periods, at lunch, on the return bus ride. We became great friends @ CAPS1 the principal thought so also @ CAPS1 he went ahead @ CAPS1 gave us lessons together. We were friends @ CAPS1, we are still friends to this day. But the sad part is that she moved out at the end of eighth grade. But she was the only friend I had for a while @ CAPS1 I still call her every now and then @ CAPS1 then. Sometimes we can talk for hours, laughing @ CAPS1 talking about how we do @ CAPS1 when we meet again. She's been my best friend for at least two years now @ CAPS1 it all happened with a slip of the foot, that drop of papers, @ CAPS1 a chuckle from an amazing person. Laughing has taken me so far in life @ CAPS1 to @ ORGANIZATION1. Every once in a while @ CAPS1 then when I see someone, all alone, wanting a friend, I will @ CAPS1 talk to them, @ CAPS1 even laugh with them. A small laugh can spark a huge friendship that is just waiting to happen. Even if you don't think so, it is. Some say, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. @ CAPS1 I believe who said this before because it happened to me.
When it comes to laughing, it can change a person's way of thinking or even the mood @ CAPS4 is in. Laughter can be the end result, a bad start to the day, or a better relationship between two people. I love to laugh because it shows how I feel and it makes me happy, not only do I laugh when I'm sad but also when I'm in a good mood. Growing up in a world full of tragedies and wars, I feel like you should always hold your head up and the smiles flow. Although, when life gives you lemons, you have to make lemonade and keep your face with the sour look because it's funny! I think laughter is one of the best medicine and can solve most problems when you are feeling down. Older sister @ CAPS2 has given birth to the most amazing little nieces an aunt can have. When @ CAPS4 were little babies, I would make silly faces, dance to @ PERSON1, and watch movies with them, but that's not what brought us together. It was the fact that I wanted to laugh, which made them happy too. I once felt really depressed but didn't want it to affect me so I preceded the @ CAPS2 day and started watching clips, when "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3", by @ ORGANIZATION1 came to. @ CAPS4 went crazy !, @ CAPS4 started to jump on the bed and spin her @ CAPS3 around like @ CAPS4 was @ ORGANIZATION1 !, @ CAPS4 really stole the show. I couldn't believe in front of @ CAPS2's eyes that this one was happening, and I burst into joy. I felt their joy so much, I had to get up and dance with them, we jumped, twirled and whipped our @ CAPS3 a few times before the song ended with us dizzy and breathless. After having fun with the clip, @ CAPS4 kept dancing and in @ CAPS2's mind I was like "never tire @ CAPS4", but I was pretty sure their laughter continually amazed them. A smile is worth a thousand words and laughter is priceless, @ CAPS2 really nieces and truly are what lifted me up that day. It was bitter at first, but then it turned sweet, let's just call it bittersweet. I feel like @ CAPS2's nieces knew I would be sad so @ CAPS4 would say "@ CAPS5, what's wrong", @ CAPS5 being @ CAPS2's nickname because I'm so small . @ CAPS4 would always find a way to make me feel the need to smile and have a good time. My relationship with @ CAPS2 neices has grown to the highest point and I know that every time I am with them I will laugh. If someone once said "laughter is the shortest distance between two people" then @ CAPS4 is correct because @ MONTH1 I'm in a different country, state, or region, but we're talking on the phone or we actually see each other i'll laugh at all their crazy antics and the closer we get to one.
Having laughter in your life is an important part of showing who you really are. Some people think that you @ MONTH1 are a person who can be "stuck" or a funny person who can really be "stuck", but in the end you all laugh together no matter who they are. When you see something really funny, you can't help but laugh. Or even when you get nervous, everyone laughs. All types of people have different ways of showing how they can use laughter in their own lives. "@ CAPS1 are blue, pinks are red, you are always in my head, I want you in my bed ..." This is meant to be a love poem. When you are in a relationship with someone, you might think that you are in love. If your partner is never open about anything, you probably aren't having a great relationship. See if you can chat with your lover for a moment, then laugh it off the next because you were a fool to discuss it. Your relationship involves love and laughter. Friendship is another great relationship for laughs. For example, my friend and I were invited to a birthday party, she had a lot of fun games and a lot of food. My friend who accompanied me to the party is called @ PERSON1. It was getting late and we were tired. We weren't doing anything, it was probably around @ NUM1 in @ TIME1. Seeing us for some reason loves to sleep, but we were having such a great time with our friends that we just didn't want the night to end. We all sat and lay on the floor and went to bed about four hours earlier watching "@ CAPS2 A". Then, by chance, I started laughing at @ LOCATION1, and to this day, I don't know why I was laughing at her. All of a sudden she started laughing a lot harder at me and then I started laughing harder just because she was laughing. I was almost to the point where I couldn't breathe. So I got up and walked to the bathroom, but I could still hear @ CAPS3 laughing in the room, which still made me laugh. Since that night @ PERSON1 and I have come very close to our friendship. Laughter is a lot in life. It can sometimes make you feel like you're dying, but it's worth it.
As we all know, water is what we need most to stay alive, because without it we would almost die. Well, it's the same with laughter too. I once heard my evening school teacher say, "@ CAPS1 is the @ PERCENT1 attitude". I thought about it for a while and realized it was absolutely true. No one can really go all day in the hole, without having any type of drink and as much as someone is upset for some reason when it comes to clothing, will soon end up smiling. Who knows maybe the silliest thing ever. I've been dating my boyfriend @ LOCATION1, for about seven months now. We don't see each other as much as I would like. We try to spend weekends together as much as possible, but there were times when it was every other weekend. Since he and I have left some things in common like our loved ones, knowing each other before dating, the places we go to have fun, eat, love and hate. We rarely like where we spend our time together or what we do. Even though it's been about seven months since we've been dating, I feel like we got to know each other well before we became friends. Once, when I was at @ LOCATION1 to celebrate the birthday of @ PERSON2, the youngest sister of @ ORGANIZATION1. We, everyone who was there, celebrated her birthday with pinatas, cakes and whatever she wanted, with witch toys too. We all had a great time but the kids weren't so much it seemed like they were running low on energy as they were playing in the trampoline for a few hours. Before the kids could even mention anything about the pinatas, we had already obtained most of what was needed to install the pinatas. As they heard the candy entering the pinatas, they all rushed to get there before the others could hit the pinata. @ PERSON2 will hit the pinata before everyone else, since it was her birthday, then the little ones followed her to hit the pinata. As they went up to hit the pinata we sang songs, it wasn't the best but we all tried. We even made jokes, pretending to imagine who was the pinata. Over time, it was the turn of the older children to climb up and hit the pinata. Most of us were a little shy, but before I noticed it a @ NUM1 year old went and hit the pinata. Right after she hit the pinata hard, the others said her time was up, they couldn't wait to get out the candy. After her turn was over, she was supposed to call someone. I thought she would call me eventually because she kept looking at me. I was already blushing, luckily she didn't. she ended up calling my boyfriend. He of course got up and grabbed the stick to hit the pinata. Once there, the others told him not to hit him so hard or the little ones wouldn't like him anymore. Since he's one of the people who love @ CAPS3 everyone. He encouraged me to go with him. Without him saying that, I don't think I would have. There we were where, teaching me how to swing the stick to hit the pinata, I swung it so hard I ended up hitting it. Before @ CAPS2 even said anything, one of his aunts said. That's how I would become whenever I bothered with him. @ CAPS3 starts out slow, then hits it where it hurts the most. I was even redder than when I was elated, all I thought was it could be true when it happened @ CAPS3 then @ PERSON1 'mum was already pulling the cake out, I just left d 'where I was to go and help her out. Once we all settled in to sing happy birthday to @ LOCATION2 we were still laughing about what had happened. The thing is, they're still talking about it. How could it be the same when we have fun. Again, I didn't know what to say so I just simle. Everyone was leaving and just before I could call my dad he was already at the door. All I said was thank you dad, with a silly smile.
Just @ walk CAPS1 by @ Organization2 in a banana costume with one of your best friends. We tried to find the best costumes for a @ CAPS2 party. When so much fun taking a lot of photos and videos that we have lost track of time. I can not even remember that we were laughed at the hardest. @ CAPS3 is just an example of the crazy things my friend @ PERSON1 and I did together. One thing is certain, whenever we're together, we're still trying to laugh. Laughter reduces stress for both @ PERSON1 and I. We were team members for the past six years. All Both we competed as a gymnast @ Organization1. We worked out at the gym @ DATE1 for four hours a day. We have no time to go out with friends and just enough time for homework. At @ Organization1, @ PERSON1 and I had to be focused so we wouldn't get hurt. @ CAPS3 meant on the floor, we needed to laugh to reduce stress, as well as fear. To do this we hang out a lot on weekends and in the sun @ DATE2. Our friendship was strong because of all the fun and laughter together. When one of us became stressed we would cheer the other up by remembering the days when we were laughing like crazy. Even when we're not together, we often think about memories that we shared together. As mentioned earlier laughter also helps reduce fear. It helps because if you are not having fun and laughing you will be thinking about all the bad things that could be happening to you; then would - have you laughing in the game, it makes you want to do anything that would be with your friend. Laughter @ PERSON1 and I always shared attached to others to us. Whenever we were together others always wanted to join because we had a great time together. For example, we were DATE2 @ @ home LOCATION1 and we were trying to play to the outside on a warm sunny day. We were about to laugh and suddenly the one of his neighbors watch. After we came more and more children and his friends came, after a while it seemed like we had the whole neighborhood there with us. When we had a large group of people, @ PERSON1 and I would choose a different game that would be better for a lot of people. It was generally a hide and seek scoring game . Even though it wasn't just the two of us we were still laughing because we were fooling everyone who was playing. He created a good and a positive bond for both of us even though there were more people. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @ CAPS3 is how @ PERSON1 and I became such amazing friends today. Seriously, I don't think we would have been so close friends if we hadn't laughed in our friendship. Our laughter brings us closer every time we see each other. Laughter really connects the bond between friends and it helps both of you get through your tough times.
"Many others think that laughter is an important part of any relationship." Many other people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. I also agree with these thoughts. I came to @ LOCATION1 about @ DATE1, I haven't spoken @ CAPS1 all this time. I started to go to school. I practiced saying my name, age and where I came from before going to school. The next day I entered school and could see that everyone was looking at me. It was pretty scary for me. I looked at a girl and she walked over to me. “@ CAPS2 my name is @ PERSON1,” the girl said. "@ CAPS2 my name is @ CAPS4. I'm from @ LOCATION2. I don't really speak @ CAPS1," I said to @ PERSON1, then @ PERSON1 started laughing so hard. "@ CAPS6- @ CAPS6 you have an accent," said @ PERSON1, "that's really cute." I laughed back. @ PERSON1 looked really nice with his smiles and we became friends so quickly. She was my very first friend @ CAPS7. I always thought it was hard to make new friends, but laughing made it a lot easier than before.
Laughter is the best way to show someone that they are funny. It is the best way to relax. Everyone says hearing a baby laugh is good. Watching comedians perform their roles can boost people's morale and make them laugh. Laughter is the best way to relax and here are three reasons for it. First, no one can stay mad at the person who makes them laugh. Second, when someone laughs, everyone around that person laughs. Third and final reason is that no one can stay sad when something funny is happening. What do you think of when you hear a baby laughing? I think the baby is really loved by his family. He or she has fun playing with someone in the family or with themselves. They think whatever you do is funny. A comedian's job is to make a crowd of people laugh at or with them. One way a comedian does an act is standing comedy. It is then that an actor is on stage and plays his role. Another way is a comedy. A comedy can be a @ CAPS1.V. show, play or movie. Comedies usually don't have a plot, but the point is to make you and anyone else laugh. That's what I think of laughter. It helps everyone relax. It's good to hear a baby's laughter. Comedians love to hear people laugh at or with them.
@ CAPS6 only happened a few weeks ago on a day when all the students were supposed to be having fun or sleeping because there was a lot of snow outside. A guy was crying in his chair, his hands over his eyes, a horn on his knees and his gaze fixed on the ground below him. Sobs drowned out the sound in the group room but luckily for this guy's pride there weren't too many people in the room to begin with. The guy's head lifted, tears seemed to eat the strength of his normal self, and @ CAPS2 spoke to the person still sitting to his left. "@ CAPS1 just doesn't understand @ PERSON2" the broken, cracked voice over the words "I don't care that @ CAPS1 is playing in cascading winds or that @ CAPS1 is getting private lessons or that @ CAPS1 has gone to the band State Honor ! This @ MONTH1 seems like a terrible reason, but I just want to play first because I want to play first, and @ CAPS1 never lets us play first. " @ CAPS2 was right about one thing, @ PERSON2 really never let us play first. I kind of figured out where @ CAPS3 was coming from ; @ CAPS4 my first year I had always sat under him, and him under someone else and so on. I had never seen him be the first president on anything. And now, in her senior year, a child prodigy had entered the group and she only knew how to fight for her position as first president. In short, @ CAPS3's four years of hard work for the first chairperson spot in the group boiled down to being the second best by the time she walked into the room. The feeling of all of his hard work getting mediocre in his face, over time, had broken him to tears. @ PERSON2 was much better than us and she has the praise to prove @ CAPS6. She had attended the cascade winds solo ensemble festival, orchestra camp and would be going to @ LOCATION1 as a music ambassador. Something about her having the first part still didn't feel quite right. Maybe @ CAPS6 was also my feeling of wanting superiority. @ PERSON2 caught the words, leaned closer to say. "I understand @ CAPS1 wants" @ CAPS10 with confident tones first, she said, "but right now we need specific players in specific places. I've played harder music and my skills are what I need in the first part. I understand how you feel, I've been there before. " @ CAPS6 struck me as strange for a sophomore to say this to a senior. How could she have felt what @ CAPS2 was feeling? she had been a child prodigy in @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 from the start. I sided with @ PERSON1 but @ CAPS10 realized that letting him play a more demanding role would be worse for the group. So I tried to side with @ PERSON2 but @ CAPS10 all I could think of was that it was @ PERSON1 last year to shine as a French horn player @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8. They continued to clash. Each comment scratching the already fragile surface of the argument. The minutes made the quarrel more and more volatile. I had to think faster. @ CAPS9 the argument continued like this, the horn section would be torn and cooperation would be useless. More importantly, I would lose two partners who together had uprooted a lot of musical talent. I slid my chair next to them to share my thoughts with them. "@ CAPS9, a man has no socks", I liked to start my thoughtful speeches with mysterious beginnings, "@ CAPS10 so ...". And that's all I got. I thought @ CAPS6 was awesome their faces were saying otherwise. So they called me crazy and laughed @ CAPS10, they laughed at me and laughed. Fortunately, I was oblivious to what they called me because I really wanted to remember what I wanted to say. @ CAPS3 finally stopped crying, and @ PERSON2 got my message that @ CAPS3 was a senior and didn't really have a better chance of playing the first chair in the @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 group. They settled the fight with a simple agreement; @ CAPS3 would get the first chair as soon as we stop competing. @ CAPS4 @ CAPS10 I have been at the center of all the mockery. But as boring as @ CAPS6 is sometimes, it's usually funny to everyone, including myself. I can't even begin to imagine what the group @ CAPS9 would look like, their enmity had reached the zone of no forgiveness. There had been times when heated discussions left stress levels in our section, so @ CAPS7 @ CAPS6 made @ CAPS6 difficult to breathe properly. Laughing out loud right before they were about to tear their faces off gave them time to realize that they understood each other. Or they've opened their eyes to how much time they're going to have to spend next to each other to keep fighting. Either way, @ CAPS6 has definitely changed the way they feel about each other ; I haven't heard them revel in each other in a while. @ CAPS3 is eagerly awaiting his turn to shine and @ PERSON2 for better or worse is eager to see him play.
We are happy together @ PERSON1 told me @ CAPS2 that we were lying on his bed. I just smiled and knew it was going to be a great relationship. @ CAPS5 has always made me feel so good. @ CAPS5 made me feel beautiful. Now don't say you're too young to know what love is, @ CAPS1 I've heard it from my mom every time I talked about him. But I know no one has ever made me feel so good about myself, made me feel perfect. When we're together it's fun. Most of the guys I've been with haven't had fun with @ CAPS2, @ CAPS2 on our dates together, walking to the park to sit and talk, eating out to kiss in public. Before dating, we were best friends. We are still best friends. Everyone asked us @ CAPS6 that we were dating the answer was always no we are best friends but always wanted more. @ CAPS5 always made me laugh. I don't think we would have made such a strong couple @ CAPS6 that we didn't make each other laugh. Just thinking about @ CAPS4, I first knew I loved him made me laugh. I was walking to my class @ DATE1, and out of nowhere @ PERSON1 grabs my arm and pulls me into a huge bear hug, and buries his head in my neck and laughs and says "@ CAPS3, you've got some toilet paper sticking out of your pants "I felt my face turn twenty different shades of red. I smiled and gently asked him to hide from me so I could grab him. When I got to my class @ DATE1, I was thinking that @ CAPS4 might @ CAPS5 tell me that, @ CAPS5 must have wanted to embarrass me. But the more I thought about what @ CAPS5 did and @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 it made me feel, well, I felt like @ CAPS5 really cared about me. Wanting to help me rather than embarrass me. I bet all the other guys were laughing. Not @ PERSON1 ... well, after that we had a good laugh. After laughing and joking about what happened to me, @ CAPS5 looked up and kissed me. Didn't know @ CAPS6 was a best friend kiss, or a real love kiss. So I just laughed. then @ CAPS5 kissed me again. This time I knew it was a real kiss of love. We weren't like most couples either. Which made us stand out, and the more we stood out, the more people started to hate that we were together. They were saying horrible things to me in the hallway about @ PERSON1. Who knows what they were telling him. @ CAPS7 some of my closest friends started making rude comments to me and @ PERSON1. I know @ CAPS5 didn't believe anything they said @ CAPS1 @ CAPS5 would laugh at anything people threw at us. When @ CAPS5 was laughing I would always ask him what was so funny, @ CAPS5 would say "@ CAPS6 rumors aren't true so laugh about them that way people will know you don't care" I never would have thought of it. I'm the kind of girl who wears her emotions on her sleeve, so of course I would be a little offended by anything they said about us. After I started laughing at all the rude and nasty things people said. They stopped talking about us, it was like magic. I never thought I would be in @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 let alone @ ORGANIZATION1, and find a guy who would understand what I'm going through. Not to mention someone going through something almost @ CAPS2 difficult. My brother went to jail @ DATE1, and I don't think I could have gotten through @ CAPS2 as much @ CAPS2 as I did with @ PERSON1. I cried almost every day at @ ORGANIZATION1 with him. It's been about a year now. Every time I go to see my brother I remember what @ PERSON1 said, "@ CAPS6 you are happy people around will be happy" so I always smile to see @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS7 even though I know this will be the most difficult years of my life. Laughing really helps. @ CAPS7 @ CAPS6 nothing is funny just laughing. God put you on this @ LOCATION2 for a reason, and @ CAPS6 you didn't find that reason to laugh until you did. @ CAPS1 the people in your life represent the world to you, and @ CAPS6, they are down, raising them. I love @ PERSON1 for helping me understand that life is too short to be miserable and then to have a life without laughing.
Everyone loves to laugh; I don't think everyone understands the effect laughter can have on two people. For example, there may be two complete strangers, who have never seen each other in their life; as soon as they start to laugh, they can become good friends. You will never know how close you can be to someone if you don't sit down to talk, laugh, and get to know them. You might spend your whole life at @ CAPS4 with just a tiny amount of friends, but then there might be @ NUM1 other classmates you haven't spoken to who might be your friends as well. I'm sure just getting to know each other would make a difference in someone's life because for me there have been many situations where laughter has impacted my relationship with someone; especially with my best friend, @ PERSON1. When I first met my friend @ PERSON1 we didn't know each other at all, but the laughter broke the ice. A simple laugh put us at ease and everything was less awkward. As soon as we started to laugh more and more, we couldn't stop; the rest was history. I went to elementary @ CAPS4 with @ PERSON1 for @ NUM2 years and never spoke to him, but then when we entered class @ NUM3 we started hanging out with the same people and started to talk more. At the @ NUM4 class, we started hanging out outside @ CAPS4 and talking, sharing secrets, and sleeping. But “breaking the ice” isn't the only impact laughter can have on a relationship. When I'm with @ PERSON1 I know I can trust him and it's all fun. We always have conversations to talk and laugh. You could say it brought us closer together. By the time @ NUM5 grade arrived we were best friends, we had sleepovers every weekend at each other's house. When the @ DATE1 before our school year @ NUM6 at @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 arrived, we were spending weeks with each other. Not a day has gone by that we haven't been together, talking or making plans on @ DATE1 to go out. Now we can be ourselves around each other; you can always have a good time. Bringing people together is only a small part of the effects a single laugh can have on two people. When I'm sad about something @ PERSON1 makes everything better ; also vice versa; I also make her feel better. We always find each other. I know we will always be there for each other; I will always have a shoulder to cry on. We became such close friends that when @ PERSON1 was having trouble at home she needed a place to live so she wouldn't have to go to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4, so she moved in with me ! It was the most fun living with her. We thought we would start arguing and not be so close as we would still be together and we would probably be bored with each other, but we weren't. @ PERSON1 and I can go out @ NUM7 and still be together ; it's like having another sister. @ PERSON1 and I are very close, and she plans to stay living with me for the rest of @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 until we graduate. It's amazing to think that we are the best friends and extremely close, that we live together, that we are always together and that we are totally comfortable with each other for everything that started with a simple laugh. when we started talking in the @ NUM3 class. This is why I believe that the simple act of laughing can make two strangers who have never even spoken to each other become the closest friends.
A @ DATE1 @ TIME1 back to @ DATE2, some friends and I got bored. Nothing seemed fun to do. @ CAPS1 for a movie, @ CAPS1 for eating, not even calling @ CAPS2 looked entertaining. @ LOCATION1 the parents told us to go do something outside. Before leaving his house, he slips into his pantry and grabs two big rolls of @ CAPS11 wrap. “I think I have an idea” @ CAPS3 @ PERSON1 as we walk away from his house. I have no idea where we are going. @ PERSON1 keeps saying "Follow me". We all follow in a pack down the street until we show up at @ ORGANIZATION1. Cold and confused, we sit in the @ ORGANIZATION1 parking lot, waiting for all the cars to be gone. Once all the cars are gone, @ PERSON1 lets us know what we're doing here. It tells us something he did with his cousins there some time. You have three people on the roof of @ ORGANIZATION1 from @ ORGANIZATION1 scanning the road and you have four @ CAPS4. "@ CAPS4 ?" I question @ PERSON1 with a stunned look on my face. "@ CAPS5, @ CAPS4" @ CAPS6 @ CAPS4 are the people who will put the @ CAPS11 wrap across the street. The plan is that when no cars come in the distance, we jump the fence and put @ CAPS11 across the street for cars to cross and stop. "@ CAPS7 sounds like fun, but uh, what happens when @ CAPS15 stops before @ CAPS11 and pulls it out ?" @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9, looking at the whole operation. @ PERSON1 laughs a bit and @ CAPS8 "@ CAPS10 then it will be a inconvenience for the driver." @ CAPS11 Packing roads sounded a lot for fun, then black ops so we were all down. Everyone falls into place. Mark, @ PERSON4, @ PERSON2 and I are on the side of the road in an area isolated by bushes. While @ PERSON1, @ CAPS9 and @ PERSON3 are posted on the roof to give us updates on oncoming traffic. We get a call from @ CAPS9 saying it's been clear for some time. I hang up the phone, tell the guys and @ DATE3 from the floor. We all get over the fence quickly and start a first layer of @ CAPS11 wrap. I get another call. It's @ CAPS14 saying there are three cars almost at our location. We drop the wrap @ CAPS11 in the bush and go back over the fence. The @ CAPS15 is getting closer and he's a cop. Sure. We all stay hidden in the bushes as the cop picks up our huge roll of film. We only have one more roll left, which should be enough. @ CAPS9 calls again and @ CAPS8 it's clear. We go out again and start to prepare the stuffing. We wrap it around @ NUM1 times and make it as tight as possible. Perfect. "@ CAPS15 entering ! Go! Go! Go !" the mark yells, trying to get over the fence. We all get there on time and go out into the field. Lying there anxiously, someone whispers " it's coming ". The @ CAPS15 slams on its breaks and the driver exits. He looks at @ CAPS11 with disgust and seeks responsible children. @ CAPS9 lets out a big "hahaha" from the roof that even we can hear perfectly. The guy climbs the fence looks around a bit more and mumbles some rude words under his breath. He didn't even bother to continue, he just entered his @ CAPS15 and saved. "@ CAPS16 my god that was hilarious !" I say with a big smile on my @ NUM2 @ CAPS9 and @ PERSON3 scurrying across the field with a scared expression on all their faces. "@ CAPS18!" shouted @ CAPS19 rushed in different directions. Mark, @ PERSON2 and I jumped over the fence and hid in the play structure for a while. While the rest of the boys book him in a safe haven. We all finally end up at home @ LOCATION1 without being " caught " by the authorities. It's nights like @ CAPS6 where laughter really plays a key role between a large group of friends like me. Laughter and running bring us together as a group. it brings us together.
I agree when people say laughter is what brings people together the most. In my opinion, @ NUM1 when you are talking to someone, laughter is necessary. This is what brings out the monotony of a person and makes the conversation interesting. It is only when you are talking about something serious that you don't need to include laughter, but explain it badly later. So I can easily tell a true story about the laughter of my life. Right now I have a perfect group of friends. Sure, there are times when they get it wrong and act like kids, but I feel like I have to forgive and remind myself that they're there when I need them. Anyway, I remember the first time I met each of them, and the only thing that started our friendship was a joke. I don't remember exactly which joke we shared, but I do remember we all had the same taste for comedy. And once we saw that neither of us were serious and boring, it made us want to spend more time with each other. That is why laughter creates a bond between different people and brings them closer every day. So over time, my friends and I were really drawn to each other. What I mean is that every once in a while we were happy to express our friendship through jokes. Sometimes the jokes are really stupid. Many of them caused pain - physically, and caused us to take revenge on each other. But this is how we stay close to each other. Day in and day out when we see something funny on TV, the internet, or in real life, we always show it to ourselves and know that after showing that prank, or whatever, the other person will find it. very funny. It brings us closer together and lets us know that we all have similar tastes in at least one area. I can give a clear example of this: I was watching a comedy once, and the comedian was talking about his childhood, and a prank he once played on a house of strangers. As soon as I saw this video, I immediately knew that my friends had to see this, because I knew from past experiences that they enjoy this type of laughter. And I was right, as soon as they saw the show they were amazed at how funny it was, and they were happy to have shared it with them, we got closer than ever. I want to share another example from my life, about laughter that brings two people together. So after telling you that laughter brings me closer to friends, I also want to point out that laughter brings out a sense of outline when talking to girls - or boys, if you're female. So I met this girl, and every time I spoke to her, every time I had to throw a joke or a story that would make sense to our topic. After awhile, she started joking and fussing too. She told me that she considered me a different guy, comparing me to other people. She said she meant that I wasn't a boring type of person, and that made her want to keep talking to me. I always hoped I wasn't a boring person, and jokes kept that from happening. Now this girl and I are closer than ever, and the root that started this relationship was laughter. So, as you can see, laughter makes any relationship happy and open. Of course, I'm talking about relationships that are playful, I meant that there are people who take everything seriously and can't take a joke. But I would really encourage you to take the laughter into your life, if you haven't already. Look in my life, I have used laughter and won a lot of friends, of all kinds - just by joking about something stupid. You don't have to say stupid things, but I say it would really make your life more interesting if you used laughter.
These are a few examples I remember when I was having fun and laughing in my life @ CAPS1 all began at the time when I was @ DATE1 like @ NUM1 years and cousins lived with @ CAPS3 because they had just moved to @ LOCATION1 from @ LOCATION2. @ CAPS1 was fun having them around. @ CAPS3 and my cousin @ PERSON7 and my cousin @ PERSON3 who lived right next to @ CAPS3 would still ride a bike. Sometimes Joey would take my bike without asking @ CAPS3 and I would get so mad at him. He was taking my bike like @ CAPS1 was his. @ CAPS3 and cousins were still running on the streets with our bikes. I was always the one who won the race, the kind of bike I got was a @ PERSON4 @ CAPS1 was a @ CAPS2 bike which is a bike made for dirt and racing. @ CAPS3 and cousins were behind a downstairs apartment of the street and there was a ramp that we made. @ CAPS1 was just dirt but @ CAPS1 was hard. One day when @ CAPS1 was raining so hard @ CAPS3, @ PERSON7, @ PERSON3 and another of our neighbors asked us to go out for we asked our parents if we could and my parents said @ CAPS1 was okay with @ PERSON3. Joeys @ CAPS4 said he couldn't make @ CAPS1 rain hard outside but he got out anyway. we were all muddy, I fell off my bike while trying to go up the ramp when @ CAPS1 was all muddy. then my cousin got beaten up every time he fell off the bike. By the time we finished playing outside we were so muddy and our bikes were filled with dirt. my @ CAPS4 was mad at @ CAPS3 because I was so muddy she sent @ CAPS3 straight to the shower. @ CAPS3 and my cousins had a good time-the day after we all finished we clean, we played great for super bros @ person5 @ Organization1. If we weren't playing super @ ORGANIZATION1, riding a bike or getting wet with a squirt gun and water balloons since @ CAPS1 was so hot outside. We were probably on our way to the park for a free lunch, the school always served free lunch to anyone who wanted a free lunch. many of my friends were going to the park and had lunch with my cousins after we finished eating @ CAPS3 my cousin and my friend @ PERSON3 PERSON1 @ always exchanged cards or CAPS5 @ @ @ CAPS6 CAPS7 @ CAPS8 at the time the body had @ CAPS5 or @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 cards. I had lots of cards. @ CAPS1 was fun being at the park with friends and family, while having fun eating while playing wet in the park. When I was in @ NUM2 grade @ CAPS3 @ PERSON2 @ CAPS14 and @ PERSON6 @ CAPS15 were like the three amigos we stayed at home @ ORGANIZATION2 like almost every weekend. we always stayed at @ ORGANIZATION2's house because its backyard was large and we always played hide and seek and because @ PERSON6 had like a game room with a pinball machine, basketball hoop and other games. Once on @ ORGANIZATION2's birthday, @ CAPS3 @ PERSON2 and @ CAPS17 slept at @ ORGANIZATION2 and we were playing video games like one of the games we played was Grand Theft Auto @ CAPS18 @ CAPS19 @ CAPS1 was a cool game. I think laughter is a big part of friendship because if you are having a great time with your friend and just laughing, that means he's a good person. If your friends always make you laugh, then there are some great friends to be with. Like I'm still hanging out with @ PERSON6 and @ PERSON2 because they always knew how to make @ CAPS3 laugh. This is why I think laughter is important to have with friends or family.
Someone once said that laughter is the best medicine. To me it was like someone saying "@ CAPS1 ! Life is not going to get better, so enjoy it while you @ CAPS6 !" @ CAPS2 that's what I did for a while, but laughing at everything got old very quickly. Sad to say, I still laugh about most things, even sad things. I laugh because I think if I do, everything will be better. It's not even close to what's really going on. In fact, @ CAPS6 only causes more pain and suffering in most cases. Like the time I met this guy named @ PERSON1. He was amazing. Most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he was always very upset. He was a human. Nothing more and nothing less. This is how I saw him and this is how he saw it too. When we started talking to each other it was between the grades I gave my friend @ CAPS3 and @ CAPS8 gave them to him. He was a very shy guy so he never answered on a piece of paper. Instead, he asked @ CAPS3 to tell me what he said. Then he finally got the idea to write messages on his phone, then I would read them and answer. it was fun for a while but i really wanted to meet the guy. I had seen one of his rare photos and it was true that he was very beautiful but not like a god. He didn't have a crown on his head with one of those divine skirts @ CAPS5. No, he was just an ordinary kid who dressed like a skater and was just a real inamorata. He had jet black hair (he dyed it), bright green eyes, and a smile that could shock the whole world. Signs were going through my head telling me to be careful but I never listened to them, they only made my life worse. So one day a few of my friends and I were at @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION3 with our teacher for a calligraphy convention when @ PERSON2 (my friend) started texting someone. I was a little curious so I kindly asked who it was. @ CAPS8 said it was @ PERSON1 and my heart seemed to leap. "@ CAPS6 you tell him that I say hello?" "@ CAPS7." @ CAPS8 told him that I said hello and he asked me if I was really there and @ PERSON2 said yes. This is when we were able to talk to each other more than once a day. We spoke up to @ LOCATION1. A few months have passed and we are back to our old way of talking to each other. He was very nice and never had a bromidic moment. He told me about his family (which is a little weird, but I'm not judging), his life, his future, how he felt and how he wished he could see me so he could give me a big hug (another from @ CAPS3's friends said the same but @ CAPS8 said he wasn't out loud). I told him about it all and it was like we understood each other a little. I told him my life story, but there really wasn't much to tell since my life has always been hydrobromic. I thought we could actually make things work between us, ie until he moved to @ LOCATION2. I was a little upset but I didn't really mind, except talking to each other was becoming almost as rare as seeing another photo of him. While at school one morning @ PERSON2 came up to me and looked intently. I asked what was wrong, then @ CAPS8 asked if anything could mess up my day. I told him that only coming home would do it and we laughed a bit about it. I knew something was wrong and it had to do with @ PERSON1, but I just acted without thinking about it, hoping it would ease the blow I knew was about to come. @ CAPS8 said he told her it wasn't going to work out between him and me. I sat there and like the idiot that I was, I said I knew it was wrong anyway, he was him and I was me. @ CAPS8 said he was sorry and all those other excuses but I wouldn't listen. Instead, I ignored him and moved on with my life as I think everyone should. Of course a few months later he asked @ PERSON2 to come out, but I gave it up just like @ CAPS8 did when @ CAPS8 told him no and they stopped talking to each other. So, who ever said laughter was the best medicine obviously didn't suffer the aftermath of it all.
Trust is a huge business among friends. Friends agree on the same things, express an honest opinion about it, and do not lose the trust between great friendship. You never know who can stand by your side with complete trust between the two of you. When you trust a friend, you rely on them to keep things between you. Just like my friends and me. We agreed to tell each other everything that happened and not to lie about anything. We agreed on everything on the basis of trust. Our friendship has always been excellent with not lying to each other. Tell ourselves how we feel about certain things. Then we put all of our opinions together and come up with a solution we all agree on. That is why you have to depend on each other as a team. When you break the trust between a friend, you probably won't get the same trust as before. We are not telling you anything as much as before. And it's like you never should have lost a friend's trust. You don't seem to be the same because you aren't really trusted. You are told that it is your fault for lying or for some reason not to trust. Like this time, a friend of mine didn't tell me the whole truth about what she was doing behind my back. Until I found out what she was doing, I lost almost all of my confidence in her. We don't trust him as much as we used to, but we're still friends. This is why having confidence is important in a friendship or any type of relationship. You learn to trust yourself in different ways, to know yourself better by having trust between you and the other person. You get a lot more attention when you have this trust with others. You don't seem to be left out of anything. You see that you can trust more people when you get to know them. Who knows you trust someone else who is not your best friend. So we all know that trust is a huge business between two people or maybe even more. You have to work together for trust. Have a good friendship or relationship with anyone as long as there is trust between you guys. My friends and I have learned a lot by trusting each other in different ways.
One day @ CAPS17 I was struggling to cope with some really big changes in @ CAPS13's life, I asked a friend for help. Usually @ CAPS17 I have a bad day that @ CAPS14 keeps to me. It was an opportunity @ CAPS17 I need someone else to help @ CAPS2. @ CAPS17 Went @ CAPS5 met @ CAPS13's friend she did all she could to cheer @ CAPS2 but nothing was working. @ CAPS6, she said "@ CAPS1 do you hear a story ?" @ CAPS2 wanting to hear anything that would get @ CAPS2 out of this crisis I was currently in, said “@ CAPS3, @ CAPS4 @ CAPS12 think this will help.” @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 she began. "The other day @ CAPS13 family @ CAPS5 I went shopping. We were gone for probably four hours. I stopped her right there @ CAPS5 asked her how this was relevant to make @ CAPS2 feel better @ CAPS5, she said "The more the details the funnier it is. "I told her to continue. She continued," @ CAPS6 we got home @ CAPS5 parents started unloading the groceries. While they were doing this @ CAPS13 sister @ CAPS5, I was in the living room teaching our dog how to sit, lie down, shake, talk, @ CAPS5 roll over. Every time she took a walk, we gave her half a dog treat. @ CAPS17 the parents had finished packing the groceries they entered the living room @ CAPS5 we showed them the things we had taught our dog, they had not seen them yet. After showing them everything @ CAPS13 the dad had to say was "@ CAPS7 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS12 puts on dog treats @ CAPS6, she does @ CAPS11 go in." I replied with a simple "@ CAPS8". @ CAPS6 parents said they would come back and go get pizza because they didn't want @ CAPS11 to cook after a long day of shopping, @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 they left. While they were gone @ CAPS13 sister @ CAPS5 I straightened the living room @ CAPS5 continued to train the dog. @ CAPS17 parents came back we all sat down @ CAPS5 @ CAPS5 started looking @ CAPS11.V. @ CAPS5 eat our pizza. After @ CAPS5 when @ CAPS17 everyone had finished eating we were still in the living room @ CAPS5 @ CAPS13 sister @ CAPS5 I heard @ CAPS13 dad in the kitchen complaining that they couldn't find the cookies they @ CAPS14 have bought. I looked @ CAPS13 sister @ CAPS5 said "@ CAPS12 know what would be funny? @ CAPS4 dad thought the dog treats were cookies @ CAPS5 ate one." @ Sister CAPS13 laughed. Our dad stormed into the living room @ CAPS5 threw himself on the couch, acting like a four year old boy who @ CAPS14 had his game taken from. We started laughing @ CAPS5, our dad watched @ CAPS5 scolded us, then looked back @ LOCATION1. Then out of nowhere @ CAPS15 said "I found them". Or what @ CAPS15 thought to be them. @ CAPS15 grabbed the dog treats off the coffee table. @ CAPS13 sister @ CAPS5 I did not dare to speak @ CAPS11. We have observed it. @ CAPS15 looked @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS5 reached into the bag of dog treats @ CAPS5 pulled out one. @ CAPS15 looked at us @ CAPS5 we looked away momentarily. Then our eyes fixed on him, out of our control. We @ CAPS14 had to watch. @ CAPS15 looked away again at @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS5 put a whole dog treat in his mouth. @ CAPS15 has started to chew. Then @ CAPS15 slowed down his chewing @ CAPS5 tilted his head to the side, @ CAPS14 like a dog would. What a coincidence. Then it looked like @ CAPS15 was choking on a song @ CAPS5 @ CAPS15 was starting to cough. @ CAPS15 spitting treats all over the back of @ CAPS13 moms head who was sitting on the floor. @ CAPS13 sister @ CAPS5 I started laughing hysterically beyond our control. @ CAPS13 daddy was @ CAPS14 sitting on the couch with a straight face, I swear we could see the smoke coming out of his ears. @ CAPS15 started yelling about how we should have put the dog treats @ CAPS6, that would happen @ CAPS11, but in the middle of the sentence @ CAPS15 @ CAPS14 couldn't help her anymore. @ CAPS15 started to laugh. @ CAPS6 we were all laughing then we look @ CAPS13 mum who was still sitting on the floor still in shock because she was sprayed with chewed dog treats. We could stop laughing, @ CAPS6 then she started laughing. "@ CAPS17 she told @ CAPS2 this story @ CAPS5 laughed @ CAPS6 if I had cried. Then I realized" Everything @ CAPS12 has need is a little laugh in your day to brighten up your life. "
Have you ever been afraid of falling off a cliff when you are in the mountains? I have, in fact, had this experience. It was a @ DATE1 @ TIME2 @ PERSON1 that we had just gotten off the bus. I had recovered all my equipment in the storage under the @ PERSON1 bus in the direction of the tracks. we put on our boots @ PERSON1 went to the elevator to grab a chair. I was with my friends @ PERSON1, @ PERSON1 the three of us joined the school snowboard team that year. The three of us grabbed a chair to the top of the trail. The air was so crisp, @ PERSON1 the snow was a new layer of powder. We were all so excited to go riding in this perfect one @ TIME1. As we went down the trail it was the same old habit every @ DATE1 @ TIME1. so i spoke to my friends @ PERSON1 suggested it is time for us to take some new trails. They agreed, so we went to the new area of @ TIME1. It was a good trail with lots of jumps @ PERSON1 lots of powder. It seemed like a perfect place to board. We all enjoyed it very much. But we realized it was coming to an end when the trail narrowed a bit, then suddenly there was a drop right in front of us. I moved my board to the side so I could stop, but it didn't help. It was a patch of ice that I hit, @ PERSON1 it was no use. I couldn't stop. I fell, @ PERSON1 braced for impact. I thought I was about to be seriously injured from the rocks below. But luckily my board was the first to hit the rock, flooding the cool @ TIME1 with sparks lighting it up. I slid on the snow a few more yards, trying to stop. As I stopped, I looked back wondering how I had survived this. I was afraid my friends would do the same, but they stopped just in time. We all couldn't believe what had just happened. I learned a lesson from @ TIME1 to always mark off the area before walking through it. Fortunately, I was not injured, I could have been seriously injured.
Laughter, everyone from babies to the elderly does. Laughter is a helpful element in life. They say "Laughter is the best medicine" that it really is. Laughter lets people know that you have a good sense of humor and that you like to have fun and let go. In any friendship, relationship, job, or sport, you need to laugh every now and then. You can't always be serious. Being serious @ NUM1 as they say is not good, it makes people feel like they don't know how to enjoy life or have no sense of humor. At @ DATE1, I had a tough volleyball season. Many of my teammates have had issues with me as I was chosen as captain alongside my friend @ PERSON1. We weren't the most popular, but some loved us. It was difficult for @ PERSON1 and I to prove that we were right for the captain position and that we could lead the team. A few of my teammates at the time quit because they didn't want to face @ PERSON1 and myself as captains, but when they quit we put the college people through junior at university. The new members of the university had a hard time, they had a bit of a hard time trying to figure out, but they did, they got to understand how the university plays and trains. Shortly after our misfortune of having to replace seven of the fourteen players, we had our first game. The game was one of the toughest of the whole season. In our first set, we didn't exactly have the first of what was going to be a five-set match in mind. We fought for a few points in the first set, but ended up losing that first set. We went into the second set not knowing what we were going to do, give up or half - @ CAPS1 it was difficult, as captain I said "@ CAPS1 we're not going anywhere unless we @ CAPS1. " then @ PERSON1 says "I agree, let's let @ CAPS1 do our best and don't let them win easily." We did exactly what we tried and we won this second set. It was the third set and we were starting to tire and feel exasperated, so we went ahead and won the third set. One more set and we would win it. We went on the pitch and the ball was served, we let the ball hit the ground for a point to the other team. After that first point the slope went down, we let them take over and they won the set. It was the fifth and last set where we were going to win or lose. We entered the field knowing we could lose and we started. The first point came back to us, we went back and forth a ton in the last set. It was a tough battle, but we did it, we won. Later in the season we met the team again and it was a battle we lost the second time we met them. to glide. It was time for the state playoffs, we had reached the state final. The team we were playing was the team we had faced twice before and we were one and one. The line-up was called, the national anthem sang, and the piece was returned, we would receive the service. The match was in full swing, we were doing very well, we won the first set by four, a difficult first match. We entered the second set, we lost control. We didn't do what we were supposed to do. We lost the second set he was and the confidence hitter. We were down, didn't know what to expect in the third set, and as captains the team seeing @ PERSON1 and I shouldn't have let ourselves down. We looked at each other with that look I knew and we just burst out laughing, we couldn't stop the team wondering what was wrong. So we explained that to win we have to laugh we @ MONTH1 feel depressed but you have to laugh and did the team come into the third set more confident than ever and we won we didn't stop there , we went into the fourth put and won. We did what we wanted to win ! In the end, laughing was what we had to do, we had come so far we could give up or push and be successful. We watched the previous two games that we had met with the other team before and laughed. We have made our team's motto “laugh until you cry and cry until you laugh”. Now in season @ DATE2 we hope to repeat the State Champions.
Laughter is a major element in a relationship. Laughter once saved my best friend relationship with his girlfriend. They had just had the biggest fight I had ever seen. The fight started over something so small and insignificant that neither of them could remember what it was. The fight snowballed until neither of them knew why they were arguing. Then one day, while they were taking a break from the fighting, we went to see a funny movie. A moment after the movie started, I got up to go to the bathroom, and when I came back my friend and his girlfriend were both gigglingly laughing. I asked them what was so funny, but they didn't want to tell me. @ CAPS4 the movie where we went to a restaurant @ CAPS1 for dinner. While we were seated, my friend muttered something that I couldn't hear to her girlfriend, and she burst out laughing. I asked again what was so funny, and again they said it was nothing. During dinner, which was amazing for the food from @ CAPS1, my girlfreind girlfriend got up to go to the bathroom. @ CAPS4 she was out of earshot my friend turned to me and said, "@ CAPS3 will never believe what just happened. Me and she are not fighting anymore. @ CAPS4 @ CAPS3 is gone for going to the bathroom, I asked her if she could remember what we were arguing about, and she said she had no idea and was fighting just because she didn't want to lose the chat. @ CAPS4 she said i confessed and said i was arguing for the same reason. It made us laugh so much because we realized the argument could have been over long before that night. " @ CAPS4 I hardly ever heard of them fighting again. That was until they got into an argument when she left the state. The argument was that he wanted to have a long-distance relationship, but she didn't. Since laughter saved their relationship for a little while, I firmly believe that laughter is an important part of a relationship. It also serves as a great icebreaker for a conversation.
@ CAPS10 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS9 my @ CAPS2! Laughter, you need it to survive in this world. Someone has to laugh at least ten times a day. Have you ever heard it takes more muscles to frown than to smile? Well I believe it to be true. It is more convenient to be happy than to be sad. For me. In @ DATE2, my family lived in @ LOCATION1, @ Organization1. My mom and dad had @ baby daughters num1, before my brother and I were born. It was a beautiful snowy morning on @ DATE1 ... Christmas! My sister, @ PERSON1 in a bright yellow dress was @ CAPS13 happy to be present and get the cake! As soon as @ CAPS6 opened a large battery powered monster truck, her beautiful light blue eyes looked as big as watermelons! @ PERSON1 walked over steddily, and got into the huge truck. There was only one problem, @ CAPS6 could not reach the pedals. Everyone was there, silent ... they started laughing out loud because @ PERSON1 awkwardly looked like @ CAPS6 was dancing in the beacuse truck @ CAPS6 was trying to reach the pedals. So my mom said, "@ CAPS3 someone should go help @ PERSON1 go ahead on the truck." " @ CAPS4 which was probably the worst idea ever! My @ CAPS2 is @ NUM2 years old, and around @ NUM3 pounds, and not in the best shape. @ CAPS6 said annoyed, "@ CAPS5 I will help @ PERSON1." @ CAPS6 rolled up on the couch and stood by @ PERSON1 and the truck. My father was chuckling in the background . My @ CAPS2 seriously says, "I need a stick or something to push on the 'go' pedal. " @ CAPS6 went and found a long stick in the snow. They decided they should try it outside because @ PERSON1 wanted to feel the freezing wind on her soft baby face as @ CAPS6 got into the truck. @ CAPS13 my mother bundled up @ @ PERSON1 in NUM1 jackets, gloves and a beanie. Somehow, they have to - above a snowy @ NUM5 foot and slippery we live on the hill. My @ CAPS2 pushed down on the "go" pedal and it went forward @ CAPS4 the front tires got caught on her long dress @ CAPS6 was wearing and she ran! Next thing we know, @ CAPS6 tumbles down the hill screaming at the top of his lungs! That's when her red floral dress flew and we got to see her thong. My sister said loud and clear, “This is gross @ CAPS2! " @ CAPS9 just a few minor bruises and scratches my @ CAPS2 was @ CAPS5. This was the @ CAPS10 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS9 my @ CAPS2 ever! I watched it on @ CAPS11 video. We @ MONTH1 put this video on the "@ CAPS10 @ CAPS11 @ CAPS12." @ CAPS13 if you see it just remember me chuckling on the back of my head. @ CAPS13 Remember , you should always laugh or smile more than frown or be crazy. Laughter is the key to a happy life!
Laughter @ CAPS1 brings excitement and joy to any medium or subject. Have you ever thought that laughter is a key part or element in a relationship? One time when laughter really helped or created a relationship was when I met one of my best friends even today. I had just started fifth grade at a new school; I went from private to public. There were only a few people I knew there because of my family, and those people were my cousins. As you can imagine, I sat next to people I have known for most of my life, and being in that position was very awkward. So at the end of the day I was ready to leave school and it was my first time walking home since this school was much closer than the previous one. I had to walk home with a child who lived right next to me; what I had never known because of my young protected life. Luckily it was easy to talk to him and we both had something in common which was skateboarding. That's when we started @ CAPS1 because we talked about some falls we had that weren't that nice and he asked if we could go out after school, and with me as a shy guy i said okay. After a while he came with his skateboard and told me to go down that ramp that I had. So I did and fell on my back which we both found hilarious and started @ CAPS1 together. This @ CAPS1 that we've been doing since returning home really made me feel comfortable with him and kind of bonded us. I think fall was a key part of our friendship because it took the awkwardness out the window and helped us start talking about funnier things that we had seen. Since then, whenever we go out, something happens and we laugh as hard as you can imagine, which is remembered as good times. @ CAPS1 has always "sweetened the mood" so to speak and always makes a good time to be unforgettable or a really boring time to a "let's do something" time. Also, in any situation where I have been @ CAPS1, or start to laugh, I feel good because everyone laughs when I laugh. Most of my friends are also my friends because of my laughter and the times I make them laugh. Overall, most of the relationships I have are due to @ CAPS1 and how they comfort two or even more people by bonding them together and making everyone feel like they are having a good time with each other. others. This is the key because most meeting people, even friends, can be very awkward or unpleasant. So anyway, @ CAPS1 is a necessity because everything would be boring, and you wouldn't really have anyone to have a good time with. Therefore, whenever I meet someone new or even someone I know, laughter has to exist in order to have a relationship with anyone.
A lot of people still say that a good sense of humor is very important when looking for a significant other, or even a friend. @ CAPS4 some people don't realize @ CAPS1 how much laughter can bring people together ! I now know that it only takes two people laughing together to be great friends. My best friends, @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 have become my friends by doing @ CAPS1. All my life I have attended small schools with my aunt @ LOCATION1. We're only two years apart, so we can usually stay within the same @ ORGANIZATION1, so I never feel alone. @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 ended up going to a different @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 than me. I should face @ ORGANIZATION1 on my own. My first year of @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1, I was pretty nervous. It was my first time in a huge @ ORGANIZATION1, I had @ CAPS1 move and I didn't know anyone so I was pretty shy. I made my first friend quite easily during one of my classes; @ CAPS3. @ PERSON4, the teacher, wanted us to have partners, so that we could do some exercise together. @ PERSON2 and I both chose each other for some reason, I don't know how, @ CAPS4 we were attracted to each other. @ PERSON4 told us we would do the "mirror exercise". We chose someone to be the engine and someone to be the mirror. @ PERSON2 ended up being the mover. I had to follow his movements exactly so that @ PERSON4 couldn't tell who the mirror was, @ CAPS4 when @ PERSON2 started acting like a monkey, we both laughed and @ PERSON4 even laughed too. During lunch, @ PERSON2 introduced me to her friend, @ PERSON1. @ CAPS2 affirmed to know her for several years. @ PERSON1 and I smiled at each other, @ CAPS4 we didn't really talk at all. By the time my last class of the day arrived I was ready to go home, @ CAPS5 because it was a @ CAPS6 class, never really liked @ CAPS6. I found out I was sharing this course with <@ NUM1 ! </ @ CAPS7> @ CAPS8 we already met and shared @ PERSON2 as a friend we sat next to each other . We still didn't have much to say. A few days have passed and we still haven't really talked, we @ CAPS1 awkwardly sat next to each other. Meanwhile @ PERSON2 and I became closer friends, performing silly skits together in @ CAPS3 the class laughter brought us together, @ CAPS4 didn't really notice, as it was no different from the way i made most of my buddies. One day we had tests in our @ CAPS6 class, we had to go to the computer lab. @ PERSON1 and I chose computers side by side, we started our tests in silence, as usual. Then suddenly @ CAPS2 turned to me and asked if I had ever heard the "@ CAPS11 @ CAPS12". When I said no, very surprised, @ CAPS2 sang it for me, right there in the middle of the computer lab. When @ CAPS2 finished we both started laughing so hard it hurt. Our teacher advised us to shut up and we resumed our tests with a smile on our faces. After that moment, everything changed! Like magic, @ PERSON1 and I started talking and joking all the time ! @ PERSON2 noticed the change, @ CAPS2 was glad we got along so well, @ CAPS4 wondered what caused the sudden difference. To this day @ PERSON1 and I share laughs whenever we have the time. Although I am busy with childcare, @ ORGANIZATION1 and my job. As @ CAPS2 goes to college, nothing can stop the connection we made that day, through the power of laughter ! I learned that laughter is the basis of all relationships. @ CAPS4 it is not the only one. You also have to have confidence. If you can't trust someone @ CAPS4 they're humorous, that doesn't make them a good friend. You also need a sense of security. If your friends encourage you to do something that makes you uncomfortable, they aren't very good friends. I know @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 are the best friends I will ever have. Laughter brought us together and I know it will keep us together for generations to come!
@ CAPS11 was @ DATE1, hot and dry had not seen any @ CAPS26 for a few miles. We had been walking for a good six hours now @ CAPS18 munching on some jerky leftover scraps. @ PERSON3 had not said much today still annoyed to drop the canteen, I would have laughed if the length of our lives did not depend on this canteen. I hadn't even heard a grain of sand move along the dry, dead land that day in the scorching sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up to the sun was on top of @ CAPS11 but @ CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already passed. Finally gaining the courage to open my wrinkled and bloody lips, I managed to spit something out, "@ CAPS1 sounds good right now, @ CAPS3 don't you think?" @ CAPS2 didn't even take a look at me, couldn't tell if @ CAPS2 was @ CAPS18 ignoring me or @ CAPS2 was so sunburnt her skin would tear @ CAPS18 turning the head. "@ CAPS3 don't make me start singing, you know how bad I sing. @ ORGANIZATION1 @ PERSON1 left me after I started singing to him." I started to laugh. "@ CAPS4 so I'm going to die on my own? Make it better?" @ PERSON3 finally speaks, surprisingly with his neck still intact. "@ CAPS5 wasn't that bad, @ CAPS18 is trying to imagine that @ CAPS31 had whiskey in @ CAPS11. You know how much you hate @ CAPS11, huh ?" I asked, kicking a rock. "@ CAPS4 have I ever started riding with you and these outlaws, I should have @ CAPS18 stayed home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself." @ CAPS2 muttered, looking away. "@ CAPS8 you did it, now we can go on or you can go on this way and get lynched. This way." I looked into the distance, not much to see except a little brown dot couldn't tell @ CAPS9 @ CAPS11 was. "@ CAPS9 do you think this is?" @ PERSON3 asked. "@ CAPS10 a dead animal." @ CAPS11 it was a few hours since we had spoken, the brown dot was getting a little bigger as we got closer. I still couldn't make out @ CAPS9 @ CAPS11, but I knew @ CAPS9 I was hoping @ CAPS11 was. My boots started to wear down a few years ago, now revealing a gaping hole that my big toe couldn't help but stick out of. "We don't have any more jerks, it's all gone." @ PERSON3 growled as @ CAPS2 threw the bag over his shoulder. "@ CAPS9 do you think it is anyway?" @ CAPS2 spat. "@ CAPS3 don't know but @ CAPS11 is quite big and @ CAPS29's sun is very hot, I think @ CAPS11 has a nice shade under @ CAPS11." @ CAPS11 was almost dusk, but the dot had grown noticeably larger about a mile from @ CAPS11 by now. "@ CAPS11 is getting dark, how are we going to see where we are going ?" @ PERSON3 asked looking at each step. "@ CAPS17 it's hard to walk without looking." "@ CAPS18 thinks of @ CAPS11 as @ CAPS19 on the donkey's tail but having to walk up to the donkey blindfolded." "@ CAPS20, @ ORGANIZATION1 knew how to party, their pies were great." @ PERSON3 started to fantasize. Now walking with my arms outstretched, I would have known if we were at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole so as not to smash @ CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a thud, then I felt something soft, "I think we @ CAPS28 @ CAPS11", @ PERSON3 slowly said, I now realized @ CAPS9 that it was a thud. "@ CAPS21 be an abandoned jeep." "@ CAPS9 are we going to do with @ CAPS11?" @ PERSON3 asked. "@ CAPS23." @ CAPS24 above the front seat door the padding was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke up to another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing at us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I started looking for @ CAPS26. "@ CAPS9 are you looking for?" @ PERSON3 sighed as @ CAPS2 fell from the jeep. "@ CAPS26, @ CAPS9 otherwise ?" @ CAPS27 searching through dusty old paper I managed to find a piece of rock hard gum, a cigar stub and a half empty bottle of @ CAPS9 that I was hoping to be @ CAPS26. Oh @ CAPS9 that I had given for this bottle to be filled with @ CAPS26. The whiskey was all I have @ CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty car I @ CAPS28 @ PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. "@ CAPS28 one of your favorite drinks," I said, sitting up against the door. "@ CAPS29 anything can you find ?" @ PERSON3 mumbled. "@ CAPS30." I stared at the horizon, nothing but sand. " I'm marked, are you marked ?" " @ PERSON3 asked, looking at me. "@ CAPS31, what scares me are the times @ ORGANIZATION1 @ PERSON1 caught me munching on his pies before dinner," I started to laugh. "@ CAPS20, that's right," @ PERSON3 laughed as @ CAPS2 wiped drops of sweat from his forehead. We @ CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @ CAPS18 with and joking. @ PERSON3 was a pretty bloated guy, @ CAPS11 is too bad I brought him into everything @ CAPS29. @ CAPS2 died of heat stroke. This wasteland was harsh and unforgiving, @ CAPS11 is something I will have to wear forever.
Laughing is like feeling alive, that nothing else matters, that the pain in your life is released and that everything is fine. You laugh when things are funny and sometimes even when they aren't funny, maybe to make someone feel better or just to relax a bit. When someone tells you a joke and it's hilarious, do you just sit and watch them, or fall to the floor laughing ? Personally I fall to the ground laughing hysterically. You can have the best of times when your laughter lightens the mood a bit, making it less strained in the surroundings. I have often liked to laugh at the stupid things we do or the dumbest things we do and make them less bad by laughing. My friend and I have been going on an adventure since the third year. We walk around and get lost, we built forts in the middle of nowhere, we drove his quad on the sandy racetracks and we climbed fences to pass the time. Every little adventure we have had came back with a laugh and a huge story to tell friends and family. After all of these adventures and growing up you seem to lose interest but you never forget the good times you are having. Let me tell you about a great time I laughed so hard I even started to cry. When your little one you think things are @ CAPS1 harder @ CAPS3 they really are, or things are @ CAPS1 bigger @ CAPS3 than they really are but that hasn't stopped me. When @ PERSON1 and I were around @ NUM1, we loved to play outside, climb trees, bury old treasures to find when we were growing up, and spy on neighbors. Well that day @ PERSON1 and I chose to "spy" on the neighbors. We enjoyed doing this because they had kids, pets, and tons of cars so they were outside of A @ CAPS1. @ PERSON1's dad had about ten tires right next to their fence so usually we would stand on them and toes just to take a look, but this time we figured it would be too obvious we needed to be more devious, more like a tip, and more secretive. Eventually @ PERSON1's dad left for work and was away for a while, so we had things to prepare. We thought of every possible way to look over the fence, from drilling a hole to sitting on top of the shed. Finally, after some thought, we had the perfect idea to climb on the trash can and sit down and spy on them. Being brave as I was, I volunteered to go there first to make sure it would work so that after I was done @ ORGANIZATION1 could give it a try. Don't climb over the trash cans next to a wooden fence, things don't turn out the way you expect. As I climbed on top of the trash it was starting to shake and I was scared so I hung onto the top of the fence but the problem was I pushed the trash can away from me causing it to tip over and I hang on to the fence leaving me with the worst scratched hands I have ever seen. After the wild adventure we had, I needed something to cool my hands quickly as they were burning. So we had the idea of looking in his daddy's van through the first aid kit but hey we were in it I noticed a small fan hanging next to the radio so I turned it on and I placed it my hands in front of her for a good half an hour. @ CAPS3 @ ORGANIZATION1 and started talking about what happened, thought of everything and couldn't stop laughing it made me cry because I was laughing so hard. No laughing @ PERSON1 and I wouldn't have the friendship we have today. Laughter is the main source of friendship that I feel. All the adventures that @ PERSON1 and I share, well they wouldn't be the same without laughing afterwards. You can look back and say "@ CAPS2 this sucks." Or you can look at it and say, "This is hilarious." @ CAPS3 laughter tells you to cry. I could see that laughter was the shortest distance between two people because it helps make things less embarrassing, helps you realize your mistakes and joke about them, and it helps you be yourself without having to pretend you are. 'be someone else. If the friendships were founded without laughing, I don't know if they would be that good, at least I know some of them definitely wouldn't be the same.
The comfort of a laugh. Many types of comfort can come from laughter. My story is the comfort of love. @ CAPS6 I was a young, stupid teenager. (@ CAPS1 wait, that's what I would still be today.) A few days ago my friend @ CAPS2 made me laugh so hard, and all because @ CAPS5 slipped when meeting my mom. (@ CAPS2 was nervous to meet my mom.) For some reason @ CAPS6 I started laughing @ CAPS5 suddenly started acting like everything was okay and there was nothing to worry about. @ Last CAPS7 @ CAPS6 we went for a walk, I asked him about it. I just said "@ CAPS4 has your mood changed @ CAPS6 I started to laugh?" @ CAPS5 smiled and replied "@ CAPS6 you are laughing, I feel calm and I know everything will be fine." @ CAPS7 being a typical teenager myself, I blushed, @ CAPS7 quickly changed the subject, trying not to make eye contact. Suddenly I couldn't help myself. The feel of his eyes on my cheek was stronger than my will not to look. Slowly turning my head, sure, @ CAPS5 was looking me straight in the eye, his eyes were wonderful, they reminded me of sunflowers with a blue sky behind them. As @ CAPS5 looked at me, I felt like @ CAPS5 was trying to unlock everything I am and everything I know with his eyes. As if @ CAPS5 could see straight into my soul. I quickly turned away. With a soft and almost beautiful voice @ CAPS5 lets a little laugh. The laughter was as sweet to my ears as the nectar to a hummingbird. The following days were tough. All I could think of was this walk. People must have thought I was crazy, every time I remembered the walk, every time I remembered his laughter. @ CAPS7 let out a laugh. @ CAPS7 I realized that laughter plays a big role in everyone's life. For me I laugh @ CAPS6 I am with the people I love. For some, it's watching TV that they find fun, or maybe the kids did something pretty stupid. So silly you had to tell your book club. The point is, laughter is everywhere. Laughter is never a bad thing in fact laughter has been proven to have many health benefits. Some people just don't get it. Laughter is not something to be ashamed of in the ether, if someone is laughing at you, just laugh with them. It is not laughter that starts wars. it is not laughter that kills. its inhabitants who have chosen not to fill up there live in the joy of laughter. So here is the goal. laughter can also be very contagious. So give it a try and @ CAPS8 for a laugh. Do something the folks at @ CAPS6 remember, they'll start their own laughter. Laugh- @ CAPS8 on it !
The Benefits of Laughter We all understand the benefits of laughter as it's the shortest distance between two people and that a lot of people @ CAPS1 we're going to specifically tell you how laughter works in a fraternity that has a lot of good times because of it. laughter. Well I know for a fact that my brother and I have the best time when we laugh and joke. It seems like laughing makes us have the best relationship the brothers can have and we have a lot of fun. Next thing we're going to talk about is the power of laughter in a family and in a boy-girlfriend relationship. The way it works in a family relationship is for families to get together and talk about the past and laugh at things. they did it when they were kids. see the power of laughter that brings families together. In a relationship like a boy and a girlfriend, this is how I see it. If the boy can't make the girl laugh, the boy should never talk to a girl. I know girls love to laugh and have a good time with their friends and over there man. So, men, how do you make a girl laugh so that you can have fun and show you're not afraid to talk to girls okay. Well, as I see it, let's continue. Well I talked about a brotherhood and a family and a boy and a girlfriend so let's talk about a friends relationship now. The way I see it is people like friends who can make them laugh and have a good time with them. friends that people want to have and these are the kind of friends that I have and love so much. Alright, let's go to the last part ok. Well now you see the benefits of laughter in a brotherhood, family, friend, and boy and girlfriend relationship. the way I do it or I see it the way I do, but that's life and it's my life.
Laughter is a sign of good relationships. For some people, it's a sign of personality, a sign of love, and also a sign showing someone you love them. For me, laughter is what makes people so unique. Everyone has a different type of laughter. For example, when you are a baby, @ CAPS2's laughter is high pitched. The older you get, the less @ CAPS2's laughter becomes "like @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1". If it weren't for his laughter wouldn't be who he is. When I was a kid I remember trying to laugh like @ ORGANIZATION1 did. I would walk around the house trying to really laugh @ CAPS1. My family if that was the best thing ever. They would ask me to laugh like @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 so they can laugh too. Today my laugh is what I wanted it to be, "@ CAPS1". It's hard for me to laugh quietly now. Some people have told me things like ; “@ CAPS2's laughter is what I'll remember you” or “@ CAPS2's laughter is really something else”. I love my laughter because it's part of who I am. Seriously, you, me, or anyone else won't be right now. Laughter is one way to show emotion. So go ahead and try different types of laughs. It doesn't matter what you can't change the one you were meant to have.
In my story, I'm going to tell you about a fun time in my life when me and my brother loved playing pranks on my aunt. @ The first paragraph of CAPS1 concerns the first prank we made on my aunt. when i was about six and my brother was four and my aunt had just bought a gorgeous purple suede sofa, she loved the sofa @ CAPS1, and me and my brother at the time thought my aunt had loved the couch @ CAPS1 more than she loved us. So me and my little brother took two jugs of chocolate syrup, and put them on my aunt's brand new three-thousand dollar couch. The second prank was just myself, and one day I was playing video games and my aunt was getting ready for work. I was getting very frustrated with the game and threw my controller down, man my aunt ran over and made me jump in the back of my head so fast, and she told me to be a good sport and try again. But I was upset because I just blew myself up on the back of my head so I was looking for revenge, when my aunts go to the bathroom to go put her make- @ CAPS3 for work I will in the kitchen and grab some grape soda, I walk over to my aunt's purse, open the grape soda, and pour it all over inside my aunt's purse. The last paragraph is about the worst prank my little brother and I have ever done. One morning when my aunt was at work and my dad was asleep my little brother and I were sitting on the couch watching TV and my little brother said he has to go to the bathroom and knowing us kids, we do everything together so me and my brother go @ CAPS3 stairs to the bathroom, and we see the biggest box of fifty-four rolls of soft and lush toilet paper. Me and my little brother love toilet rolls for some reason, so we open the box and my brother drops one in the toilet, so put one in the toilet, then he puts another in the toilet, then I flush. We had no idea it would backfire and the toilet started to overflow, but I continued to flush the toilet. Then I take another roll and start unwrapping it on the floor, my brother gets one and @ DATE1 we are on our knees in toilet paper and water. Then our aunt goes through the front door, we don't see her because we are having so much fun in the toilet paper and water, then she comes @ CAPS3 stairs, goes to the bathroom also to see me and my brother and a battered bathroom, full of toilet paper and water. But the only thing she tells us is. CLEAN @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 ! She slams the door then me and my brother look at each other then start cleaning. Then finally, after hours of cleaning, the bathroom is again as it should be. @ CAPS1 is the conclusion of my story about the three worst pranks my little brother and I did on our aunt.
Being with family and friends on a memorable trip always seems to bring on a smile. There are always times to look back; whether they are fond memories or nostalgic thoughts. I was about to graduate and my parents had just informed me that we were going on a trip to @ LOCATION1 after the end of the year. We had the date set; @ DATE1, right after school ends. The first reaction that came out of my mouth was swearing-in, wishing my best friend would join us on this trip. My parents took the time and thought about all the pros and cons, and quickly responded in the affirmative. I was delighted to know that the memories I was about to make with my closest family members now had to include my best friend. The first thing was the first, I had to get to work. I needed to call my friend @ PERSON1 and ask her if she wanted to come. Selfishly assuming that his immediate response would be an "@ CAPS1 !" rambunctious, I was @ CAPS4 for the first time devastated when she postponed her response and @ CAPS6 seemed overly excited. I did not take into account @ CAPS6 that there was some kind of communication problem with @ MONTH1. She spoke about it with her mother and called me back. I had made the mistake of not telling him that we would be financially covered for plane tickets, meals and hotel rooms. We clarified everything and they decided that she @ CAPS3 is joining us. Together we could '@ CAPS6 have been more ecstatic if we had tried ! @ PERSON1 and I had a countdown which started about two months after our departure date. Many factors had to be taken into account when planning. While we measured exactly how much time we had, we also planned out the landmarks, resorts, and shops we would visit. Our family friend was living at @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS4 at the time, so she showed us around the island. Having an acquaintance so close to guide us made the trip even more fun. She knew all the local hangouts and had access to military beaches as she works in @ ORGANIZATION1 ! There were many humorous events that happened often during our vacation, but some of the most memorable moments happened at the hotel while I was with @ PERSON1 and my mom. My mom always knew how to make every situation hilarious so it was great when we were going out on a girls night out. First, and most important of our adventures, we went shopping in the mall attached to our hotel. There was an abundance of small assorted clothing stores, food stores, and jewelry stores. One of our favorite stores we visited was a shirt store @ CAPS6 with chocolate infused fabrics ! We spent so much time looking @ CAPS4 at all the designs, that I think we ended up taking a wave of cocoa with us for the rest of the night. As soon as we finished our shopping quest in the city center, we walked back into the room, laughing and involved in pointless girlish chats. The three of us girls hung out with smiles, sore feet and new bags in the elegant, richly designed golden elevator. My mom hit the button to take us to our floor, while @ PERSON1 told a story about the plans we had the night before. Absorbed in the conversation, we dragged our new stuff down the long hallway to our bedroom. Realizing that we didn't have @ CAPS6 a key card to open our bedroom door, the three of us decided to knock on the door and my dad would answer. "@ CAPS2 was supposed to be back from renting our surfboards now, so why is @ CAPS6 @ CAPS2 responding?" we thought, “ @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2 still at the beach ? " @ CAPS4 at this point, the conversation was somewhat subsided while we were trying to understand what to do. I texted my dad's cell phone and @ CAPS2 said @ CAPS2 was in the room. We ended up knocking on the door for a good five minutes, assuming @ CAPS2 was playing a joke on us by not responding. After waiting a few moments in confused silence, I started to notice a low, buzzing voice coming from inside the room. I turned to my mom and my best friend, and @ CAPS3 barely stopped laughing. That's when it hit me, and I said to both of them, “ @ CAPS5 guys ! We did not @ CAPS6 leave a @ CAPS6.V. lit ! " We immediately stopped our intrusion, we have moved as quickly as we CAPS3 @ the door and continued to howl with laughter. My mom pressed the wrong floor button in the elevator! We were so wrapped up in having a great time that we didn't even realize @ CAPS6 that we were bothering someone and embarrassing ourselves ! It was just a moment @ CAPS6 or a trip, now it's a life of joy because I can recall those memories and their smile @ CAPS4. These are the moments that I cherish the most.
Emotions are an integral part of life. Certain emotions bring tears and laughter, which in themselves are two powerful and essential things in life. It wasn't that long ago that I was able to turn a girl's tears into laughter and make her day a little better. It all starts with the craze of today's teenage world, "@ CAPS1". Which, for those who don't know, is a website that teens spend a lot of time on, and people can communicate through this website. I log in and see that this girl I love is also online, so I start talking to her. The normal teenage conversation of " @ CAPS2, what's up ?" " This kind of thing happens, then she asks me if I can go out. Now tell me if I'm wrong, but most guys would go out if she's a girl they like. I went to find her at the library and as always, she was beautiful, although I doubt she was trying. As I got closer to her, she seemed upset, but when I asked her what was bothering her, she wouldn't tell me. I didn't want to make it worse, so I left him alone. All I could think of was what I could do to make her happy, so I started talking about the craziest things, not knowing if that would help or not. To my luck, that helped and she started to smile. After a little while, I made him laugh and have a good time. Since that day we have been dating and are really happy, and every day when I see her I say something random to make her smile.
The Element of @ CAPS1 and Laughter Laughter is an important element that a person might have when they are in a happy or happy mood. Laughter is a big part of a person's life; it shows others that you appreciate something they've done that puts you in a good mood enough to share a laugh. Some people react in different ways when it comes to laughing because of their emotions; others laugh at hilarious jokes and other types of people laugh at people's accidents while others don't. Emotions are a big problem in a person's life. Some emotions are joy, sorrow, jealousy, fear or anger. Being happy makes people want to laugh at something. Sometimes when people laugh too much they start to cry. People like everyone else @ CAPS4 are in a happy or cheerful mood because then they can also receive these good feelings ; therefore, it makes others happy to get more people to adopt a positive attitude as well. Another thing that makes people laugh is jokes. Some jokes can be really funny, some can be rude and some jokes can be really hilarious and you will always remember them. But jokes can sometimes get complicated; to a small child you can say "@ CAPS2, @ CAPS2 !" " @ CAPS4 is there ? " " @ CAPS5. " "@ CAPS5 @ CAPS4 ?" "@ CAPS5 @ CAPS4?, Don't cry about it, that was just a joke," and the kid laughed. But for someone @ CAPS4 is older you have to think a little more to make them laugh. People love to laugh; they love to laugh at people's jokes and especially hilarious pranks. Sometimes pranks really aren't that funny. As you see a friend of yours taking something that spits out garlic and knowing that the person who is about to be pranked is allergic to garlic. But most of the time, fun things help people cheer up when they're down. Also, accidents are things that can be really horrible at times, but at other times some of the accidents that happen in life can be very hilarious for some people. Some accidents, people can decide to take it one way or the other. For example, a person might think that another person who is about to jump off a diving board but slips and bangs their back against the diving board is really funny and another person might disagree with that and take things upside down and think it wasn't funny at all. It's like when someone says they have a really funny joke or something hilarious to say, and you end up thinking that it was something that was awkward or a tragedy or that it could also be there. 'reverse. You might think you have something funny to say, but for your friend, it was something that really bothered him or something that he found not funny at all. In other words, laughter is an important part that a person could have in their life. It's a part that one person can help another person when someone needs a good laugh to share with another person. Enjoy good times with friends to share some laughs, don't just be cranky all the time, be happy. Laughter is a good thing; people love it, so don't always be serious and at least share a few laughs with your friends or relatives.
Laughter Laughter can make a situation less uncomfortable, bring two people together, or just show you're having a good time. In my experiences, laughter happens at the best of times. On a typical day from @ ORGANIZATION1 to @ ORGANIZATION1, I was sitting with my friends at lunchtime discussing what is going on in our lives, when I notice a girl sitting on her own. I don't recognize her, she must be a new student. I ask around to see if anyone knows anything about her; nobody knows. Thinking back to the girl, she looks very lonely and needs a friend. Curious to meet someone new, I walk over to her and chat after a little while we relax and start talking about our interests. I remember she said something funny and I started to laugh, she started to laugh at my laughter because it sounded almost hysterical and everyone thought it sounded ridiculous. At that moment, as we sat there laughing together, I realize that it brings us closer and closer despite the fact that we had just met ten minutes ago. Laughter makes life more enjoyable and happier knowing that you can share this with someone you just met or someone you have known your whole life is magical. It is a universal language that everyone should speak. Laughing is healthy and good for the heart.
There was this time during @ CAPS1's vacation, and there was a lot of snow on the ground. My cousin @ CAPS2, my brother @ CAPS3 and I were all together and going out to my grandparents. My brother @ CAPS3 lives at @ LOCATION2 and my cousin @ CAPS2, and I live here at @ LOCATION1. So it wasn't that hard trying to get us all together, cousins. We all got together to go out to my grandparents and snowmobile together and spend the night out for a few nights. When everyone gathered and started to go out, it was too late to snowmobile. We were all very sad but it was okay. We just watched live movies at @ LOCATION3 and waited until morning. By the time the morning came, of course, it was too cold to go out when we woke up. So we made a hearty breakfast and after breakfast we all got ready and then sat down until it was warmer to go out. Finally it was the afternoon! We all dressed in warm clothes to go snowmobiling. We all went outside and my grandpa had one of the snowmobiles ready for us and behind it was the hood of a truck so he could pull us from behind. My grandfather rode the snowmobile and we, the kids, were in the back. My grandma only went with us once and she got off because my grandpa was going crazy and we were all getting hit when he was driving. Then once we kids were the only ones on the hood by Grandpa it started to go really fast ! I was the only one covered in snow and looked like a snowman. It was so funny! My grandfather ran inside to pick up my grandfather's camera so she could take pictures. Took her a while to take them because she is not very good or fast at taking pictures. Then, when she was done, we returned to the snowmobile for the rest of the day. After we got everything done for the day, I really looked like a snowman. It was a fun day and very funny what I looked like as a snowman, but after the fact I got really cold. We walked inside and I went right in front of the heater to warm up while my grandma made hot chocolate for all of us.
We were heading for our first ski race. On either side of me, my friends @ CAPS1 and @ PERSON1 were seated, crammed into our team van. Our packed bags and ski gear filled the vehicle to the top, along with six other children, filling all other empty spaces. Our uncomfortable seats didn't seem to spoil our enjoyment, within five minutes of our road trip the van exploded into laughter, as @ PERSON1, quite possibly a future comedian, started cracking jokes, being him- same as usual. Within the first five minutes of our trip, I could already tell it would be a ski trip that I will always remember. The van drove to the hotel parking lot. My ski team would be staying here for the long weekend. The sky had turned dark with the @ TIME1, and I and everyone were trudging along with tired eyes, exhausted from the long drive. We quickly unloaded our bags, all eager to jump into our beds, needing to be well rested for our first ski race of the season. Soon after, everyone was soon in bed, knowing that five in the morning would come quickly. The sun has started to rise over the mountains, signaling the time to wake up. It was not the case for me. I had been up for almost an hour and sat in our van as we sped around every corner up the mountain. It was race day, and I and all my teammates were all excited for the day ahead. The morning flew by, collecting our bibs at registration, obtaining our lift tickets and inspecting the course. I was now standing on top of the hill, watching the course in front of me. I had to concentrate. Even though I had a lot of fun, it was time to focus, to give the best of myself. The pressure was on. I was now standing in the starting grid, my coach was standing by my side and my friends were watching too, cheering me on. I hoped not to disappoint. “@ CAPS2 ready,” the official began in a strained voice, “@ CAPS3!” I threw myself off the starting grid. I flew over each door, keeping control and most importantly, going fast. The wind glided over my aerodynamic body, my ankles and knees rolling with every turn. Everything was fine until I got over the hill. My body compressed, bringing my knees to my chest, as I skied on the roller, causing me to lose my balance. I fought to get up, to pull myself together, but I couldn't. My skis spun under me, causing me to spit out of the course, landing on my back, sliding down the mountain, desperate and lost. It was finished. I sat in the snow, frustrated with my performance. I wanted a second chance that I wasn't going to get. @ PERSON1, a teammate of mine, came up to me and sat down in the snow next to me. My first thought was that he was going to say something of a "great job " cliché or a " you will do better next time ". To my surprise, he tells me one of his ridiculous jokes. My mouth turns, trying to contain a laugh, without success, I burst out laughing. @ PERSON1 is sitting there smiling at me. Almost immediately I found myself in a better mood. I give him a quick " thank you " with a smile before we @ CAPS3 to watch and cheer on our teammates. Even though I didn't do my best, I didn't let my results ruin my weekend. The next day I skied two solid slopes with excellent finishes, if I had stayed mad at myself I would never have been able to achieve these results. I realized that on some days just a little laugh can be all you need to turn around any day. Laughter I have found is essential in any situation. It's a connection that can bring anyone closer. For me, laughter changed my personality that day on the mountain. Laughter can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people, laughter can be a special bond between people. Laughter can take away the seriousness or the competitiveness of a situation, but it also unites us. Languages are different from people to people, but everyone understands what a laugh can do, laughter is universal.
The @ CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter seems to be almost the basis of a relationship with friends, without laughing there is no spark of interest in wanting to be someone's friend. When I think of laughter, I think of the times when I go to @ ORGANIZATION1. Even @ CAPS2 I had the most horrible day, I know the girls I play with on this team who are like second family to me can always cheer me up by the things they say or do . The underlying relationship between an @ ORGANIZATION1 team becomes unknown to the outside ; no one really knows how much we laugh together, or how much frustration builds up between us. Frustration @ MONTH1 gets the best of us sometimes, but I can think of a lot more memories where I was lying on the grass laughing because a stupid decision from a player turns into one of the funniest things that I have ever seen. I remember the first time I had a workout @ ORGANIZATION1, at @ DATE1 in grade two, I played with many girls who had been to another school that I had never seen before. All the girls decided they wanted to see who was best at juggling a @ ORGANIZATION1 ball on their knees. It's my turn to try, and as I was about to hit him with my knee, he hit the wrong place so he went up and hit me in the nose, leaving him bloodied. I didn't know how to react, so I started to laugh. At the time, a girl I had never seen laughed with me and came to give me a tissue. Believe it or not, the girl who gave me a handkerchief that first day has become my best friend ever since. The laughter that occurred that day bridged the gap between us. Since that day, we have never had an awkward silence as to what we should say or do. Came in the fall of fourth year, I had just joined the team @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1, still playing with the same girls except a few people. I didn't know what to think of these people or what to say, so I decided not to say anything. We were playing monkey in the middle and I was babysitting a little blonde girl named @ CAPS3, who had really good skills but was a bit awkward. She had started running for the ball, and lo and behold the clumsy girl tripped over nothing! Thoughts jostled in my mind; should i laugh? Will she hate me @ CAPS2 I do? What is @ CAPS2 really hurt by ? While those @ MONTH1 thoughts are coming true, I went with my gut and burst out laughing. She turned to see who had started laughing at her accidental trip, and started laughing too. After the incident, we got up and started talking, realizing that we had been to the same school but had never associated with each other. From that day forward, we became inseparable at school and became best friends. The next story has nothing to do with @ ORGANIZATION1, but everything to do with laughter. While there is no certain story that I can tell you in particular that happened between this girl and me, all I can say is that she is the one who gave me the first experience of laughing until you cry. I remember she had moved into our school, and I was no longer the "new girl". At first I thought she was the strangest person I have ever met, but over time I found out that she @ MOIS1 was one of the funniest people I have ever met encountered. @ CAPS2 I would have realized in advance that this girl has the personality she has, I would have walked up to her in the blink of an eye and made friends, instead of hiding behind the crowd. Since we became friends, our friendship has been based on laughing together, and I wouldn't want it any other way. In the end, the person who once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people," was absolutely right. I used these stories above to show how shy or awkward a person @ MONTH1 is, sharing a laugh with a new person is the easiest way to find a best friend. When I was introduced to laughter by these three people, I started to become more social throughout my college years, and now also throughout my high school career. @ CAPS2 I lived a life without laughing, I would lose the life I have, and it would be filled with boring memories that are not worth sharing, and for me, it really is not worth the sadness. Over the past six years, I've won three best friends through laughter, it really shows that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and it's really a @ CAPS1 to have it.
Laughter is part of my daily life. I always laugh at school or at home. With laughter you can show many emotions that cannot be said in words. For me, it's also a way to show how lucky your life is. I have had many occasions when laughter was the solution to my problem. I also agree that laughter is an important part of a relationship. In the next few paragraphs, I'll talk about how laughter affects my relationship and the benefits it brings to it as well. About three months ago my family and I decided to take a trip to @ LOCATION2. We had planned to stay there for about a month. When I told my boyfriend that I would be gone for a month, I immediately saw the sadness in his eyes. It really killed me though, our decision was made and there was no turning back. Our relationship was strained during this month. We spoke a few times but his voice was different. There was sadness and I knew something was wrong. Although he said everything was fine, I knew his sadness was due to my absence. Once the month was over, it was time to come back to @ LOCATION3 ! I was really excited. We arrived at @ LOCATION4, @ LOCATION1 at @ TIME1 a @ DATE1 @ TIME2. I immediately called him but there was no way I would see him this same @ TIME2. Although just knowing that I was closer to him made me happy and anxious. We chatted for endless hours, telling each other that we would never be this far again. We laughed and laughed throughout our conversation. For me, the sound of his laughter was a sign of his happiness and it was priceless. The laughter was as if it had blessed our relationship. From that day forward, I realized how laughter really affects me in so many ways. It's like it brings happiness and prosperity to my life. With just a laugh, the sadness goes away and that's when happiness kicks in.
A few months ago I was hanging out with my friend @ CAPS1. It was a @ DATE1 and I came to see her for the @ TIME1. At first we were bored so much so we went for a walk to find something to do. for a moment. After hanging out there for about two hours, we returned to her house. When we opened the door her sister started to panic because we left so she got stuck with her younger brother @ PERSON1. @ CAPS1 didn't scream she didn't want drama. Her sister got even angrier because jesssika was not showing a reaction to what her sister was doing. After ten minutes, she exploded and started to throw herself and panic. Me and @ CAPS1 looked at each other and said they were laughing out loud because her sister looked funny. @ TIME1 after her mom calmed it down, @ CAPS1 and I made a @ CAPS3 bed on her bedroom floor and when we fell asleep we both burst out laughing it was @ TIME1 on more fun I have had in a long time. ( :
Alive, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 Laughs @ CAPS4 at this @ DATE1 I don't remember exactly why I was laughing. All I remember, very clearly, in my mind is the look on my grandfather's face. He had the same smile he always wore during times of joy. It was a broad, warm smile that he lit up from time to time in your path. As I laughed uncontrollably that @ DATE1 so many years ago he made his happiness @ CAPS1 love shine on me for so long that I will never forget a single wrinkle of his smile. My @ CAPS16, which we all called @ CAPS5, had a way to keep the @ CAPS1 peace of mind in everything. No matter how badly things were in our family, he would always work things out. Nobody could get mad @ CAPS3 @ CAPS5, @ CAPS1 nobody could stay sad when he smiled. He's just the kind of guy he was. @ CAPS5 was a big part of our family reunions just like the one we had at my @ DATE1 @ DATE1 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS5. This @ DATE1 was our family's @ DATE1 @ CAPS8 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS5, shortly after he passed away. When I look back @ CAPS1 realizing how important @ DATE1 was, I can see it was a perfect @ CAPS8 for everyone. It was a happy @ DATE1 @ CAPS1 my @ DATE1 memories of my @ CAPS16 were his big happy smile shining on me as I laughed during a game of cards. When this @ CAPS8 started, in the early hours of the morning, the weather was already proving spectacular. Everyone in my family was in a good mood @ CAPS1 was ready to enjoy the family @ DATE1 @ CAPS3. My favorite activity at every @ CAPS1 every family event is playing my favorite games @ CAPS3 everyone. Our family has some specific games which are a tradition at family reunions. One of our favorites is called @ CAPS12- @ CAPS13. Now @ CAPS12- @ CAPS13 was one of the many games my @ CAPS16 was very good at. He rarely lost a game, @ CAPS1 wouldn't finish playing until he had won at least once. So when everyone was in our house, I convinced @ CAPS5 @ CAPS1 my cousin @ PERSON1 to play @ CAPS12- @ CAPS13 @ CAPS3 me. We went to spare room @ CAPS1 starting to distribute the cards. About half an hour later we were still playing, @ CAPS1 unsurprisingly, @ CAPS5 was winning. It was right before the food was ready @ CAPS1, we were halfway through the game when my cousin @ PERSON1, or @ CAPS5 said something to me that I thought was the funniest thing than my little ears. from @ NUM1 years have never heard, @ CAPS1 I started to laugh. My family was having so much fun @ CAPS3 my laugh that they couldn't keep their smiles @ CAPS1 laughs hidden without bursting out laughing as bad as mine. It seemed like my insane laughter created instant joy for my family, including my @ CAPS16. @ CAPS5's smile was one of the most beautiful things my little eyes looked at during my childhood. It was something so imaginary, yet so colorful @ CAPS1 alive in front of me, that I would love her smile like seeing my first solar eclipse. I never really understood, at such a young age, what was so fascinating about her smile, but now I understand. @ CAPS5's smile showed true, healthy and indestructible joy. Her smile didn't show up too often, so when it did you knew something right was going on. No one knew it was our @ DATE1 @ CAPS8 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS5. I certainly couldn't imagine that this was the @ DATE1 that I would spend @ CAPS3 my @ CAPS16. Everything was so perfect @ CAPS1 so more and more happy it seemed like a crime to end his life during such a moment of joy. Although if I were him, @ CAPS1 if I had to choose my @ DATE1 @ CAPS8, this @ DATE1 would be perfect. My only memory of this @ DATE1 was laughing, @ CAPS1 being happy. Can't think of a better way to spend my @ DATE1 little time @ CAPS3 @ CAPS5 then a @ DATE1 where we were both completely happy with our deck of cards, laughs, @ CAPS1 smiles. Laughter is a funny thing. It's unique in each person, @ CAPS1 can range from any kind of humor to pure happiness. Laughter brings hope when in doubt @ CAPS1 never fails to make someone smile. Someone somewhere started a quote that said, "@ CAPS25. Laughter. Love." I believe these three words can be combined, @ CAPS1 acts separately to sum up a perfect life for anyone who @ CAPS25 wants the true and meaningful definition of each of these words. Laughter brings smiles of happiness, humor, love @ CAPS1. Love brings us all together, @ CAPS1 when we strive to be happy @ CAPS1 to love, that's when we can really @ CAPS25. My grandpa loved every @ CAPS1 each and every friend of his family @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 made it a priority to keep them happy. He lived his life the best way I believe anyone could @ CAPS25. He passed away after a life full of love happiness @ CAPS1, most importantly, the very special gift of laughter.
Some people say that laughter is good for the soul, and it could be true, but the soul is definitely not the only thing. Laughter is also good for your heart and your mind. It can improve relationships, strengthen friendships, and even start @ CAPS5 make two people who don't know each other extremely close. You may meet someone new or be with someone you barely know, and just because they make you laugh, you feel like you want @ CAPS5 to make @ CAPS5 get to know them better . I like this feeling. Honestly, you can laugh with any age or gender. You don't both @ CAPS5 be @ NUM1 and a woman, you could be with a little boy, an elderly lady or anywhere in between and still have a lot of fun. The last @ DATE1 I never did anything @ CAPS5 so decided I should start volunteering. The two places I could volunteer were: a daycare next to @ CAPS5 at my house, or a retirement home about @ NUM2 miles away. I've thought about it a lot, trying @ CAPS5 makes the best decision for me. I couldn't make up my mind, and even though I didn't admit it, I felt like they would be just as boring as sitting at home. I finally decided that I had to do both, so that I could meet new people and have new experiences. I started with daycare. I woke up at @ NUM3 am and walked @ CAPS5 @ ORGANIZATION1. I had no idea what @ CAPS5 looked like at all. I didn't even know if I was good with kids. I walked in and awkwardly stood @ CAPS3. The manager of @ ORGANIZATION1 came to see me @ CAPS5 and asked if I could help with @ NUM4 year old's coloring room. I nodded nervously. Was I supposed to be the @ CAPS5 color for them ? @ CAPS3 has no way for them to color a picture on their own. They are only three! I thought. Well if I follow the instructions this day will get @ CAPS2 faster. When I went to @ CAPS3 all the kids ran to me @ CAPS5 with a smile on their face. "@ CAPS1 by me !" said one. "@ CAPS2 here !" another said. "@ CAPS3 is a place right here !" "@ CAPS4 on my photo !" "I drew a rainbow!" "I drew a car!" "I drew you!" @ CAPS5 that, I looked down. @ CAPS3 I was, on the piece of paper. A bunch of blue and green scribbles. That day was a lot of fun. I laughed and had a great time with the kids. I have learned that I absolutely adore children and that I am actually quite good with them. The following week I went to @ CAPS5 the retirement home. I was even more nervous @ CAPS3. I felt so out of place. I hadn't figured out what I was going to help @ CAPS5 yet, so I sat in a chair in the lobby. When the receptionist asked me who I was seeing her @ CAPS5, I said no one. She then asked me why I was here, and I said, oh, I was going to volunteer @ CAPS5. She led me down the hall and told me it was almost lunch time so I needed @ CAPS5 to get ready @ CAPS5 to serve lunch. I did, and then I heard, what I assumed was, the lunch bell. I gave everyone their lunch with a big smile and it was really awesome. If either of them looked a little down, or upset, I could send them a smile and they would smile back at me, obviously in a better mood than before. After lunch I played a few games of chess. Most of the people who were @ CAPS3 were taking naps after lunch, so @ CAPS3 was only three people on @ CAPS3. I first played with a lady who used @ CAPS5 as a nurse. I got @ CAPS5 to know her pretty well during the half hour we played the game ; that I won. Then there was a guy who was a veteran. He fought in the @ LOCATION1 war. He looked really nice, but serious. I won this game too. The last man used @ CAPS5 to be a comedian. He was so funny. He told jokes the whole game ! Maybe he said a few @ CAPS5 a lot, because he beat me at chess. Well, that was my excuse. When I was done I was in a great mod and couldn't wait for @ CAPS5 to come back. I learned a lot from this @ DATE1. I have found that everyone is alike in some ways, even though each person is unique. I realized that @ CAPS5 is not the same person as the person you are with, @ CAPS5 is laughing and having a good time. Regardless of age, race, gender, size, mentality, maturity, etc. The only thing that matters is that you are in the same place at the same time, trying @ CAPS5 to make the most of your day. I'm so glad I decided to volunteer @ CAPS5 otherwise I would never have known so much about people, love, life and laughter.
Thinking back to my early childhood, one thing that stands out clearly and brilliantly in my memory is laughter. Since I was born, I have always liked to smile and laugh. I found a kind of solace, peace, and confidence through laughter alone, which I doubt I could have found elsewhere naturally. This could, in part, be because of my @ CAPS1. We rarely get to see each other as he lives at @ LOCATION2 and I at @ LOCATION3, but when we have the luxury of spending time together it's always full of laughs and joy. I thank him for giving my love for a laugh. My parents told me that as a baby all my @ CAPS1 had to do was laugh, and my eyes lit up and a smile became apparent as wide as the @ LOCATION1 on my face. It's been like that ever since. One of my earliest memories is lying on my parents' bed listening to my @ CAPS1 tell me jokes. Every time he finished I would burst out laughing and when I saw him laughing he would burst out too. The important detail to note is, when my @ CAPS1 laughs, his stomach shakes violently like @ ORGANIZATION1. I found that to be the biggest part of the jokes. Once her stomach started to bounce up and down, my laughter got out of hand. Our laughter intensified until tears rolled down our faces. Besides having a belly that bounces when he laughs, my @ CAPS1 has one of the most distinctive and contagious laughs we've ever had the chance to hear. It's one of those fabulous, rewarding laughs whose words don't do it justice, but once you hear it you'll never forget it. His laughter can light up the darkest room in a house. To me, his laughter almost has a medicinal cure. Every time I hear my @ CAPS1 laugh, for a moment the world stops and everything is fine inside. I'm not the only one who enjoys the laughter of my @ CAPS1. He and my dad both love to tell jokes, which I have observed over the years is one of the few things they agree on. Everything from politics to religion to who should pay for dinner usually ends in an argument between them. Because of this, they tend to stay away from these topics for fear of confrontation. They never mentioned it, but from my observation over the years, I've come to the conclusion that the laughter they share so often acts as the glue that keeps their relationship strong. If it hadn't been for laughter, I sometimes wonder if they would still have a professional and loving relationship. I will always be grateful for the great gift my @ CAPS1 unknowingly gave me at such a young age. He created in me a deep and passionate love for laughter, which brought me through the most difficult times. I truly believe that laughter heals the soul and that when two people share a laugh, they are bonded for a moment in a precious, fragile and sacred way. My day can go horribly, and the moment a joke is thrown and laughter overwhelms my body, everything brightens up and the worries and stress of my day seem so small. Finding humor in every situation is another lesson my @ CAPS1 taught me. If you can find humor, you can find serenity in the most dire of times. Laughter, for me, is a bit like a drug. It's a harmless, fulfilling, life-saving drug that I can proudly say I hope will be addicted to for the rest of my life, thanks to my @ CAPS1.
Laughter is such a wonderful element to have in any relationship. For example, if you can't find any form of humor in a relationship, I'm pretty sure there isn't a strong bond between the two of you. For example, I had a relationship once where we didn't have that element of humor, and I really didn't appreciate that relationship that she and I had. Any type of relationship needs to laugh rather at friendships, boyfriend or girlfriends, and even family. All types of relationships need some form of humor to survive. Sometimes families don't have this humor for each other, but they will always have this special kind of friendship, the reason is, I believe, because your family will always be there for you unlike most. friends. In a way I know that because a friend of mine really liked a guy, I could have sworn that she @ MOIS1 even liked him, when he told her he started dating a girl , she had been crying for weeks, that when she was with her in The Moms of the House, one of her brothers whom she believed hated her, said he wanted to hurt the guy who made her younger sister cry. They @ MOIS1 didn't have a humorous friendship, or even any friendship at all, but I think laughter isn't necessarily always necessary, especially within the family. All types of relationships are like plants, the flower is relationship, and laughter is the water that will help the relationship grow big and strong. But without this water the plant will not grow, just like laughter in a relationship. I know if I knew someone who I didn't find humorous, I know our friendship wouldn't be very strong, unlike someone I found hilarious. Laughter is still an important part of everyday life. For example, if you are going to a job interview, you need to really connect with the person interviewing you and make a good impression on yourself. One way to do this is to laugh, I have heard many stories about job interviews eg my mom interviewed not too long ago for a job @ CAPS1 and she told me talked about her interview and she said they had really connected. There was also seriousness and laughter in this interview. Three days later, they emailed her and told her that she got the job and they would love to hire her. and I've heard of interviews where they didn't get the job. My sister had an interview once for a pet kennel type place where they drop their pets off while they go on vacation, and she said she and the person interviewing her didn't no connection, which had led neither to humor nor to laughter. So I believe that humor is such a wonderful element to have in a relationship because with laughter comes greatness and happiness.
Laughter is the key. You never really think about the importance of laughter, but the truth is, laughter brings together the most opposing people. Last year I met a friend of mine at school. We never really spoke but she seemed nice. We had a class together and we started talking more and more every day and she was my best friend's best friend. @ PERSON1 was her name and she was driving a bright orange @ ORGANIZATION1. We hung out after school one day and I tilted the passenger seat all the way back and sat in it like a dog and she hit the brakes and I flew to the front of the vehicle and I couldn't stop laughing. At that point, I knew we were going to be friends. I was in first grade so I didn't really know anyone and she was always nice to everyone so we started dating more. I lived about @ NUM1 miles from town and his brothers went to school about @ NUM2 miles past my house so we had to go get them. We bought a game called '@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2' and there are tons of little candies that were flavored like vomit, centipede, dirt, rotten eggs etc. the car almost @ NUM3 times in our @ NUM4 mile drive ! They were the nastiest beans ever ! Then we would drive over to my house and listen to our favorite country songs and the explosions in his car. She was my ultimate best friend and no one could replace her. Every time we fought we weren't starting the drama, we always had a real fight because by the time one of us was stuck the other was laughing too hard to do anything about it. Her dad and dad became friends later too and we still had barbecues and family reunions. We also spoke with an @ CAPS4 accent the whole time because one of our friends was from @ LOCATION1. Every time we went to @ CAPS5 for shopping we would use our accent and everywhere we go people would ask us where we were from. Before we knew it, our fathers started talking like us. We also created a bunch of slang words and then the whole school started using them. She's a great friend and she makes me laugh every day. Whenever @ PERSON1 had issues with her family she knew she could always talk to me and that I would always be there for her. She always called me sister instead of @ CAPS6 because we were so close. She was taking @ CAPS7 and @ CAPS8 classes at my old high school and when she got the fake doll it kept us awake until late in @ TIME1 this baby was crazy. @ PERSON1 would be driving and the baby would start screaming in his car seat and we would have to stop and find out what was wrong. She would be a good mom. She still cared about things, even the smallest thing she treasured. We once painted her little brother's room because we were bored and @ PERSON1 was rolling her brush in the paint and texting and she took her eye off her phone and dropped it in the paint. She couldn't find it for about @ NUM5 minutes and by the time she found it it was totally covered in green paint ! I laughed at her for so long and these are the moments that I wish I could bring back. Every time we hung out I laughed and now I realize how important that laughter is to me. About six months ago I moved to a completely different state and I don't see her very often. There is no one like @ PERSON1. She could make me laugh and was always only @ NUM5 minutes away when I needed something, now I have to drive about @ NUM2 hours to even see her. I haven't laughed like she did to me since I returned to visit her. Laughter is the key as I said before and if you frown you will never know who is falling in love with your smile.
A few years ago when I was @ NUM1 I decided to do an experiment on laughter and the color of clothes people wear. I realized that I laughed a lot and was almost always happy because of @ CAPS11, I really did @ CAPS1 in school, and I also had a very "high" attitude. The @ CAPS6 clothes were all very bright and "happy" colors. I had a theory that the less someone laughed and that the darker colored clothes they wore would lower their mood and attitude. The experiment would last a week, and during that time I was trying to laugh with @ CAPS7 and gradually start wearing darker and darker clothes until I turned black, to see how I would be affected, the optionally. To start, I had to first tell everyone what I was doing and ask them to try @ CAPS7 to make me laugh on purpose. Then I had to go to the store and buy some new clothes without any bright colors. This was the hardest part because I saw a lot of cute clothes, but they were too colorful. After that I just had to wait for the @ DATE2 to end and the @ DATE3 to begin. @ DATE3 @ TIME1 I woke up and did the usual daily routine of @ CAPS6, then tried on some new clothes from @ CAPS6. When I got to school I noticed the surprised looks from classmates @ CAPS6 @ CAPS2 they took in the @ CAPS6 outfit. @ CAPS11 was quite difficult @ CAPS7 to laugh at some of their expressions but I couldn't because it would ruin what I was trying to accomplish. Throughout the day I got comments on the @ CAPS6 clothing, and some teachers at @ CAPS6 were worried because I didn't usually laugh @ CAPS2 but when I told them about the @ CAPS6 experience , they got it and said: "@ CAPS1 luck." @ CAPS2 the day ended, I was satisfied with the success of @ CAPS6 and quickly fell asleep. The next two days went pretty much the same, and I was wondering if @ CAPS6's theory would be proven wrong. But the @ DATE1 @ TIME1 @ CAPS6 mom pointed out that I looked different. "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 okay ?" she asked. "@ CAPS4 doesn't seem energetic at all @ CAPS2 @ TIME1, and your @ CAPS7 smiling at all. Your sick @ CAPS7 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 ?" I told him I was fine. At school I was asked the same thing, and after a while @ CAPS11 got really boring. I got mad and yelled at them, which I never do, and they apologized. But I felt bad and told them I was sorry and they forgave me, telling me @ CAPS11 was probably just the experience. I became a little happier that @ CAPS6's theory might be correct. That day went slowly and I was happy when @ CAPS11 ended. @ DATE4 was the last day of the @ CAPS6 experience and for that I was happy. Dark clothes didn't bother me and I liked the way they looked at me, but @ CAPS11 was hard to laugh @ CAPS7, and @ CAPS11 was starting to depress me. That day I decided to wear some shiny clothes from @ CAPS6 to see if @ CAPS11 would make a difference, and when I got to school some of my friends from @ CAPS6 didn't recognize me because that they had gotten used to seeing me in @ CAPS6 other clothes. I didn't feel any different than when I wore dark clothes @ CAPS6. In @ CAPS5, I had to stand in front of the class to give the @ CAPS6 conclusion. “The @ CAPS6 theory has turned out to be semi-correct,” I said. “The laughter from @ CAPS7 had an effect on the mood and attitude of @ CAPS6. I was yelling at my friends at @ CAPS6 and feeling sad that I shouldn't have. But I found that wearing dark clothes didn't change a thing. " The teacher from @ CAPS6 then said something so funny I couldn't help but laugh, and everyone clapped and said, "@ CAPS9 back @ CAPS10 !" @ CAPS11 really feels like @ CAPS1 is laughing again.
Laugh, laugh. It's everywhere. A lot of people are laughing right now. Why not laugh? Isn't it good for you? It feels good to laugh here and at home. Well, laughter can make your day great. It can help you get through tough times. It can help you encourage your best friend to be happy. Well, whatever the reason, but it's good to laugh. Laughter is good for you, it brings pleasure, joy and helps you enjoy a little more. My mom and I have a great relationship. Whenever we are together, or start to talk, we will laugh and crack. Laughter has helped us have a great relationship where we can say anything to each other. I can go to her anytime and ask her for help. I can go talk to him when I need to now. Because we had a great relationship, she wasn't doing too much good, she wasn't involved in too much. She was also very depressed. I'll tell you a bit about it. My day started out as a normal school day, I got up, got ready, went to school and then knew I was on the bus on the way home. I get off a block or two from my house, then walk home. I walk and walk, ten minutes later I get up at home. I go to my room, put my bags on my bed and say hello to my mom. I walk into her room and she is sitting on a chair. I asked her if she wanted to take a walk. Of course, she said yes. She puts on her shoes and I do the same. We walk down the aisle and this is where the walk begins. We started walking on the road after we got to the end of our driveway. We walked straight for about five minutes, then took a right. We walked in that direction for about ten minutes and turned left. There's a little store on this coroner. We stopped them to buy water and snacks during the walk. After finishing, we start to walk east on the road. When I looked at my mom, she looked like she was having a really bad day. Like everyone else, I asked him what was wrong. She talked to me about everything and she seemed really sad and depressed. From there I knew I had to talk to her and make her laugh. We never had the best relationship because she always dated friends. I knew that if I could make her laugh, help her get better, it would help us get along better and help each other in the long run. I love my mom and I hate to see people depressed. I was thinking it all in my head. Being around me makes everyone laugh. The walk was about three to four miles long. the rest of the time I made him laugh the whole way back. It made him feel a lot better, I know that. Later that day she came to my room and we played boring games and watched a movie or two. We really just talked and spent time together for the rest of the day. We took a few more walks for a month or two and had a great mother-son relationship. We were both happy that it happened. About two months after the first walk she came up to me and gave me a hug and said thank you for helping her with what she was doing. I think laughter is a good thing in life. For me, it has helped me a lot in life and it has helped me save a relationship with my mom. I love to laugh and I love to make people laugh, it's fun to laugh and make people laugh. Laughter creates great friendships. It can have a lot to do with your life. Hope this helps you laugh more and makes you try to be funny and make people laugh with you.
Laughter is just one of those things that doesn't come off very easily. The simplest things can make you laugh or smile, the point is, happiness will be there for a while. My dad is laughing, my mom is laughing I'm laughing everyone is laughing, it's a good thing to have. If there was nothing to be happy about, then people would be in battles and countries in wars. Anger is not something someone wants to deal with all the time; you have to relax from time to time. My parents and I know that happiness is what drives us to good things. This is why we welcome him into our house, we like to recognize him in my young brothers and sisters. My father and I have a good relationship with my mother too, we get along well and laugh together. Me and my girlfriend @ LOCATION1; we started out in a good relationship, but over time it started to fade. We didn't communicate as well and that's what separated us. We would find ourselves in fights all the time and for no reason the fights seemed to find us all the time. We talked, we spent time together, and we started to get along better, laughing at our constant joke or teasing. We had a great time, she said she liked us to laugh and have a good time. I told him that laughing and having fun is what brings us together. Laughter is the key to our happiness, it's what brought us closer to her, it's a key point in any relationship. If there is no happiness then there is no laughter, and if there is no laughter then how are you supposed to achieve happiness. They work together and it's a good thing to have in life where we would be if we didn't have it. We would all hold a grudge for no reason to have one and live in black and white all the time.
A few years ago my dad and I were sitting at home watching @ CAPS1. My little sister and her friend @ PERSON1 were running in and out of our apartment. Every time they walked inside they didn't repeatedly close the sliding glass door, eventually my sister closed the door but her friend @ PERSON1 didn't know he was running so fast and before he realizes it, he was first going quickly in a sliding glass door! My dad and I were laughing so hard I almost peed. After we finally stopped laughing and went to see him and he looked really confused about what had just happened. We looked at the door and there was undoubtedly a mark of drool rising up as if his face had slipped over it. Meanwhile, after more laughter and fun, things calmed down and we went back to watching @ CAPS1. My dad fell asleep and his cat was lying next to him, my dad sort of woke up and looked around after a few minutes he started looking @ CAPS1 again. My older brother walked into the room and saw the cat asleep and took the advantage of him and slammed his hands on the chair. This scared the cat and he jumped about two feet in the air. Once again we started to laugh very loudly, but this time my stomach started to hurt. @ DATE1 to @ DATE1 my dad my brother and I were working in our garage and found an electric starter @ ORGANIZATION1. My dad told me to hold the metal ends and I did. He flipped the switch and the next thing I know, I was being electrocuted. We all started laughing again. Then it was my brothers turn but he said he wanted to hold the ends and push the button himself, when he did he couldn't let go because his muscles tightened and left it @ CAPS4-able to break free from a nine volt shock. My dad and I fell to our knees and were almost in tears because it was so funny. After a few more rounds of shocks we got the idea to put it on our tongues, I tried it first and my tongue started beating like a beating heart. My dad couldn't stand up long enough to keep pushing the button. As a result of all these good fun times our starter @ ORGANIZATION1 broke, we gave our cat away and @ PERSON1 moved. In other words, the funny @ MONTH1 moments are in the past but still there in your memory to make us smile.
An @ ORGANIZATION1 is a wonderful gift. It allows your mind and body to join with others. It is the root of happiness, and brings a sense of sanity to those who have lost hope. When you feel alone in the world with no one by your side, laughter will be there to accompany you. At one point in my life I felt confused and alone. I was empty. Loneliness was the only thing I could have, and the only feeling my mind would register. Just when I thought @ MONTH1 would be the only person in the world, something came to save me. I was six when they divorced. I couldn't stand hearing my parents arguing. One day we were the perfect family. We played board games and went to the movies together. Something had changed very quickly. My @ CAPS1 grabbed his jacket, told me he loved me, then left. Would I ever see him again? Why doesn't @ CAPS1 live with us ? These are questions I kept asking myself. I think I was too young to really know what was going on. The days were long and I found myself lazy and brooding. About two weeks after my @ CAPS1 left, some neighbors moved into the house adjacent to my mom and I. One of the neighbors looked young, about my age. I didn't think much of newcomers to town. I told myself that people come and go. Nothing lasts forever and I should expect the worst. One day I was riding a bike and thought I had to stop pedaling and crash into my fence. I hit the metal fence and simply fell. I heard a laugh and turned around. He was the new neighbor. There he was rolling on the ground, clutching at her sides. He must have viewed my crash as entertainment. I picked up my bike, started to move, then crashed again. Another series of laughs erupted from this boy. It was the first time I smiled in a long time. I started to like the feeling or the humor I was passing on to this newborn baby. I asked the boy for his name and he didn't answer; although he starts laughing again. It was my voice that he laughed. Everything I did made him hysterical. I later found out that he was from @ LOCATION1 and didn't speak a word of @ CAPS2. Over the course of a month or so, I felt the hole in my heart start to fill. My new companion and his laugh was the start of my new start. My mom and I eventually moved out of our house and lost contact with the neighbors. I always remember him when I hear a laugh. Although he is not physically close to me, I am guided by his laughter every day.
Laughter is the best medicine Many people say that laughter is the best medicine. For my part, okay. The reason is that in many points in @ CAPS27's life, laughter has helped me, or others, to feel so much better. @ Mother CAPS27 recently had shoulder surgery. @ CAPS4 had meds @ CAPS2 all @ CAPS34 I think the best @ CAPS4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room ... doing word search. It was @ DATE1 @ TIME1. Each stepfather's children @ DATE1 @ CAPS27 are coming to dinner. @ CAPS27 mom wasn't feeling too good so @ CAPS4 went upstairs @ CAPS2 started her big book of keywords. @ CAPS27's sister-in-law had recently bought a new car, so @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS27 the father-in-law was outside looking at her. I went out for @ CAPS19 two minutes and then came back inside. @ CAPS27's brother-in-law was on @ CAPS27's father-in-law's iPad. He showed me this game on @ CAPS22 @ CAPS2 which we started playing. Minutes later @ PERSON2, @ CAPS27 stepfather, said he was going to @ ORGANIZATION1. Katie, @ CAPS27 step-sister, @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1, @ CAPS27 step-brother, decided to @ CAPS46 with them. @ PERSON2 went upstairs to ask @ CAPS27 mom if @ CAPS4 needed anything. Then they left @ CAPS2 I went upstairs to see her. I saw that @ CAPS4 was doing his word search @ CAPS2. I started to help him. I don't remember the name of the @ CAPS34 search word that we did several. Since @ CAPS4 had already started, I looked at the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I didn't look closely enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said @ CAPS2 @ CAPS27 mom said, "@ CAPS1 me?" @ CAPS2 I started to laugh. I repeated to myself @ CAPS2 we were both laughing. After that we finished the word search @ CAPS2 started a new one. This one was called "@ CAPS3". @ CAPS4 took the book @ CAPS2 went through the list @ CAPS2 suddenly said "@ CAPS5-winks! Yeah!" @ CAPS2 I looked at her like @ CAPS4 was crazy. What was @ CAPS4. I looked at the @ CAPS2 list again I start laughing out loud @ CAPS2 asks, "@ CAPS7's @ CAPS8?" I was saying it wrong @ CAPS34 when @ CAPS24 was laughing so hard, who wouldn't ? "@ CAPS7 ?" @ CAPS4 asked @ CAPS2 that I showed it to him. "@ CAPS11 @ CAPS12 @ CAPS13." @ CAPS4 said @ CAPS2 we started to laugh. "It sounds like something the @ CAPS15 @ CAPS16 would say." I comment @ CAPS2 @ CAPS27 mom made the little song of the song @ CAPS15 @ CAPS16 which made me laugh harder. We barely made it to the end of the word search. @ CAPS34 we did it. The next one I think was called "@ CAPS19 @ CAPS20 @ CAPS21" @ CAPS22, there were several things about @ CAPS22 that we didn't know. I asked him @ CAPS7, one was @ CAPS2 @ CAPS4 like "I don't know". @ CAPS2 then I asked him another one. "@ CAPS24 asks me all the things I don't know." @ CAPS4 said. This word search was pretty fun @ CAPS34 just because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty fun. I accidentally circled the word "ear" because I thought it was on the list. This was not the case. @ CAPS34 "earring" was. We ended up finding "hairs" at the end of the "ear" that I had circled. "@ CAPS26 thank you for this photo." @ CAPS27 mom said. "@ CAPS7 ? Ear hairs ?" I asked @ CAPS2 we laughed again. When we were done, we went to "@ CAPS29". It was a funny word search. We usually read the list of words before searching for them. One of the words was "@ CAPS30" @ CAPS2 I laughed @ CAPS2 said "@ CAPS26 yeah I can see someone walking around with a @ CAPS30 on their head. '@ CAPS32, cool @ CAPS30.' "I said in a strange voice. "'@ CAPS26 thanks. Got it in the @ CAPS30 store.'" I guess I was doing a really good job because @ CAPS27 mom was laughing really loudly. "Wouldn't @ CAPS34 be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @ CAPS30. I think the tail would still hit the back of @ CAPS20's head." I said before laughing again. Katie @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1 walked into the room @ CAPS2 looked at us like '@ CAPS7 the devil ?' @ CAPS2 I showed him word search. "@ CAPS26, this is not a cowboy hat. This is the full cowboy." said @ CAPS4 laughing too. @ CAPS27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. "@ CAPS39, @ CAPS39, these are things that wear hats." @ CAPS4 managed to get out @ CAPS2 I'm looking at her. "@ CAPS7 what kind of hat an @ CAPS30 is wearing ?" I asked, smiling. @ CAPS4 shook his head. "I do not know." @ CAPS4 said @ CAPS4 was giving up. Katie @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1 then said goodbye @ CAPS2 is gone. "@ CAPS43, @ CAPS39 more. I need to take the @ CAPS27 pills." I sniffed at @ CAPS7 @ CAPS4 said. "@ CAPS39, @ CAPS24 really don't need pills." @ CAPS4 looks at me like @ CAPS4 is going to hit me. @ CAPS4 could have been if I wasn't standing a few feet away. "@ CAPS46 absent." @ CAPS4 said with a smile. "@ CAPS48." I said before returning @ CAPS2 on my way back to room @ CAPS27. I have had several things like this happen. They were all really funny. That was the humor that @ CAPS24 had to kind of be @ CAPS22 to understand. I have always said that laughter is the best medicine. Mom says it's @ CAPS49.
The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 !!! This @ CAPS2 started out like any other @ CAPS2. I wake up thinking about what to do. So I go out of my room, ask my mother if we have any plans. She says we have no plan. So after that I talked to him a bit more. I went back to my room and there I saw that I had received an SMS from my friend @ CAPS1 @ PERSON3. He asked me if I wanted to go out with him. I decided of course that I can because I didn't have any family plans. "I would love to spend time with you @ PERSON3". @ PERSON3 and I met at the @ NUM1 bus stop on royal and we went to @ ORGANIZATION2. Now see the reason we went to @ ORGANIZATION2 was because the @ CAPS2 before I had received a gift card from my grandmother and fifty dollars from @ CAPS4 (@ CAPS4 is my biological father). When we finally got to @ ORGANIZATION2 asked me what we were going to get here. I have said whatever I want. he starts to laugh. I kick a donkey shirt and some food. From @ ORGANIZATION2 we went to @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 to get some delicious food. When we entered the restaurant, the smell of the place made us salivate a bit. @ PERSON3 got a big bowl and stuffed @ CAPS15 with everything he could. We ate so much. I tied up like ten pounds. We talked about the life and the quality of the food. Where we would go next was still undecided. We have finally finished our meal. I paid for the food bowls and we went to our bus stop and went downtown @ PERSON1. While we were on the bus, @ PERSON3 decided to go to @ ORGANIZATION1. So we got off the bus and what do you know my friends @ CAPS8 boy, @ CAPS9, @ CAPS10, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON4 were downtown like a bad guy. @ PERSON3 went to smoke a cigarette. While I went to check the bus schedule for the @ ORGANIZATION4 bus. He and I had to wait @ NUM2 minutes. So we spent time with our friends. @ CAPS9 is the funniest guy @ CAPS3. I laughed until I started to cry. I almost got angry. We left to get on the bus, laughed again. When we got to @ ORGANIZATION4 we knew why we had even been there. So we just took a walk. @ PERSON3 decided that we should get into the photo booth to make this @ CAPS2 legitimate. I had a lot of fun taking our photo. The next place we went was @ CAPS11-topic. I love this store. We were there for @ CAPS3. About two hours go by. At @ ORGANIZATION4 there is this park where you can go but you have to cross the bridge to get to @ CAPS15. @ PERSON3 and I got bored and had an epic adventure in this park. There were a few trails we hiked. I tripped over a branch. @ PERSON3 laughed at me. We found this piece of concrete. @ PERSON3 and I put on some music and danced on @ CAPS12 @ CAPS13. I love @ CAPS14's music, it's really fun to dance. I drank orange soda that @ PERSON3 drank. I took a lot of pictures of him drinking soda. We pretended that the grass was lava and that concrete was a place for break dancing in the cave man era. I took a video of @ PERSON3 dancing and laughing to SpongeBob's song @ CAPS15's the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. He also ate all of my chips that I bot at @ ORGANIZATION2. After that we returned to the trails and hopped through the trees. I bowling at birds and old people. While telling them to taste the rainbow. We finally realized we had to get home, so he and I started walking to the bus stop. I missed the first bus, I caught the next one. I spent an hour downtown. Cool with my downtown friends at the park @ NUM3. You have a donut from @ ORGANIZATION3. This place is ass epic! I have intentions of this cool store near the station. As the @ CAPS2 ended @ PERSON3 and I went our separate ways. Both still at this @ CAPS2 saying that, "that @ CAPS2 was epic".
one day after school my friend @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 went home and said put on clothes that i can get dirty in and i said no but then i said ok , then @ CAPS1 said put on inflatable boats and we all started walking up to a park and we went to the trian tracks and when you got off the trian tracks we came down that hill really running and I slipped on my but they all laughed at me at the top of the hill so they came but they didn't fall. so we keep walking and we crossed a log to get to the other side and we keep walking then they took me to a mud putle and they told me it was deep so I walked in it and got stuck in the mud because he got past my boats and trying to get out but lean too far forward and fall in the mud and @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 thinks it was so fun that they laughed at me and the boats are still stuck in the mud i'm on a log so i ask @ CAPS2 to go get my boots so she tries and she falls in i start laughing at her but then i come in and we both try to take my boots off but it was too hard so i put them back in the mud so i'm still stuck and i can't get out but @ CAPS1 comes and helps me out a boot then the other then @ CAPS1 get stuck and me and @ CAPS2 go back and we all started bumping everyone was falling and laughing at each other but magan was in a tree watching she didn't want to get dirty so after that we got all our jactkats and started to come home then we got to the hill i fell so i ran up the hill and didn't slide back then @ CAPS1 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2 they are trying to go back up it was so funny seeing them climb the hill so we all made it up after a while and we go home to the trian tracks and everyone is looking at us because we are all muddy except @ CAPS3 so we keep walking then we get to Austins House and we go out her pipe and he saves himself to go get the dirt out of him while he was doing that me and @ CAPS2 where we were talking then she told me to put a handprint on her face so I did it then she told me she can now do it and i said hahaha you are dr ole so I ran away from her but she got me then we both rinsed off then went to my house
Human beings are ... unusual ... Okay, we're weird. There are so many people in the world, including ourselves, and the only way for us to love ourselves is to make others love us; if that's not weird enough, we still don't love each other no matter who loves us. What are we thinking about? We always use relationships to help us understand who we are; it is even a bet to have these relationships. In the face of the facts, we are so likely to trust others; we give them the capacity to build us ... or to break us. Our main goals as young people are to find people who love us. I think it might even extend to later times in life than that ! From my experiences, I know that there are two key points to knowing that a person can build us: trust and kindness. Finding builders with these traits is as easy as figuring out whether they bring you joy or not. A person can give you joy just by being kind to you ... but if you want a whole swarm of friends, then that's not exactly the best way. It's not that kindness is a bad way to make friends ... it's just that it's not the fastest way. If a builder is nice, you will of course become his friend ... over time ; in order to immediately know a friend when you see one, they will make you laugh. Laughter makes us enjoy our time with our friends, it is a golden rule in @ CAPS1's book, if there is such a book. And it was through laughter that I improved my @ CAPS2 class experience. The @ CAPS2 class, for me, was extremely stressful. Each day we had either a speaking duty or paperwork; and the class was really slow. Why was it slow? It was slow because we could barely follow a series of instructions without a group talking or finding some other way to disturb the class. A good example would be this one class project we needed to do. As usual, the instructions were slow; I was at my boiling point. Today seemed different however, despite the usual boredom not a single student asked to repeat the instructions, in fact they all seemed to understand and immediately started working. I too have followed this action. The task was that each group of about three to four people had to create a script using the vocabulary learned in the booklet provided ; it took a whole class period and then everyone came home to do their other work. The next day we went back to @ CAPS2 was really interesting. The professor had prepared all kinds of strange props for us. apparently we were going to ask the audience to play our script, our job was to read it aloud. My group was the first to entertain and we had finally selected our volunteers and our comedians. Tiffany, @ PERSON1 and I sat at the back of the classroom, ready to read the script, not sure what the cast was going to deliver. Our play was ... a success ?! At the end of the first sentence, everyone was laughing. As we moved into the next room, the laughter grew louder. The students were really having fun and more and more people volunteered to perform until it was difficult to choose actors. Even I, the class snob, was having fun. The plays were fun and random, some plays sent everyone into hysteria. I easily remember one of the groups that made me laugh so hard that my sides hurt, tears were running down my eyelids and it was almost impossible to breathe. This project was certainly the best I have ever been on. It's times like these where we build a strong unit in the classroom, enjoyed all the people around us, and had fun. I was so used to being angry with my classmates that I was taken by surprise that day. I enjoy their pieces so much that I now see them as an entertaining group of students, rather than the annoyance I had seen them before. These people are no longer strangers in the hallway, now they are family. It's really amazing how something as simple as laughter can change the way we look at others and at themselves.
The @ CAPS1 du Rire @ CAPS2 would we be without laughing? Would we still have relationships / friendships like @ CAPS5 ? Laughter brings out @ CAPS1's sense of being closer to someone, a sense of humor, friendship and a positive environment. Personally, I feel like the world would be a miserable place without laughing. I can assure you that @ CAPS17's life would not be the same as @ CAPS5's. Without laughing, @ CAPS17 @ DATE1 the holidays would not have been like before. During @ DATE1 @ CAPS17's vacation, my friends and I made it our mission to embarrass @ PERSON1 (@ PERSON5). However, it was not as easy as the sound of @ MONTH1, as nothing could ever bring her down. We did our best to embarrass him, but nothing was working. We tried tossing her into a pool while her crush was around, throwing our drinks at her just as a group of cute boys passed by, calling her by names only a grandma would call a child. . @ CAPS14 name it, we made it. @ CAPS12 was like a marble brick, extremely difficult to break. One day @ CAPS17, a duty friend, @ PERSON2 had the idea to grab some shorts, pull the look off the butt, and put it back on in the hopes that it would rip when @ PERSON5 bends over. "@ CAPS3 @ PERSON5", I started, "@ PERSON2 and I found these @ TIME1 shorts and thought @ CAPS14 might like them. They are super cute and would go perfectly with your new yellow tank top." "@ CAPS4 ! Thanks guys they are doing great !" @ PERSON5 shouted as @ CAPS12 was filled with excitement. "@ CAPS5 let's go to the mall !" @ CAPS6 about an hour after I walked into the mall I threw the phone @ CAPS17 down and acted like I hadn't noticed. However, @ PERSON5 panicked and executed @ CAPS6 as he slid down the path. As @ CAPS12 was about to bend over and grab her, @ PERSON4 was walking right behind her. Next thing @ CAPS14 knows, her shorts were split down the middle and her cheeks were bright red. @ PERSON2 and I couldn't help but laugh. The look on @ CAPS7's face was priceless. I wish I had the camera @ CAPS17. We have never seen @ PERSON5 so crazy. @ CAPS12 was absolutely pissed off, but @ PERSON2 and I were still @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 her. I mean, who wouldn't laugh @ CAPS10, someone's pants slipping open in front of a huge crowd of people @ CAPS10 the mall ? "@ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11" shouted @ CAPS12. "@ PERSON4 saw @ CAPS13, and @ CAPS14 is @ CAPS9? He will never talk to @ CAPS11 again. I hate @ CAPS14 guys!" “@ CAPS14 don't hate us. It was hysterical and @ CAPS14 knows it,” @ PERSON2 rang. "@ CAPS15 like we're embarrassing @ CAPS14 pretty well, huh ?" "@ CAPS16 @ CAPS17 @ CAPS18 ! @ CAPS16 @ CAPS17 @ CAPS18 ! @ CAPS16 @ CAPS17 @ CAPS18 ! We broke the rock. A few minutes later @ PERSON5 started to crack @ CAPS9 and apologized for panicking @ CAPS6 realizing it was all fun. We had no idea @ CAPS12 was planning to pick us up. By the end of the @ DATE1 break we had gone to almost every party, but there was still one at @ NUM1 and @ ORGANIZATION1. We all had a hunch @ CAPS1 this would be the best yet. Everyone had a great time @ CAPS10 @ ORGANIZATION2 and @ ORGANIZATION1's party. The strobe lights were on, there was crazy loud music, the hot tub was @ CAPS10 the perfect temperature, and there were a lot of people in the pool. Who could complain? Just when the party was about to end, @ PERSON5 a decided to undo the bikini top @ CAPS17 and lower the bikini bottom @ CAPS19 ! Humiliated we all have the s two ran into @ LOCATION2's room and locked the door. How did @ CAPS12 get this far ? Was our prank so embarrassing to her? Tired of all the complaints from @ LOCATION1 and @ PERSON3 about our escape, we decided to leave the room and forget about what happened. Let's just say we know what we did to @ PERSON5 was wrong, we won't do it again, and we @ CAPS5 know not to bother her as much as we did on our trip to the mall. Honestly, I feel like this whole experience has brought us closer together. If that didn't ruin our friendship, nothing would. Therefore, @ CAPS14 can @ CAPS5 see why I think laughter is such an important part of a friendship and / or relationship. He makes the world go round. Has @ CAPS14 had any experiences with @ CAPS2's laughter that brought @ CAPS14 and a friend, relative or family member closer together ?
During the @ CAPS1 break my family went to @ LOCATION4 except for my older brother. We were heading towards @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION4. It was a long drive but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents' house, there was already snow! I was very excited. They had about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before going out to enjoy the snow. Later, while I was outside, I received visits from old friends of mine. I haven't seen them since @ DATE1. We talked and hung out. They told me I was lucky to leave school early for @ CAPS1 vacation. They still had to go to school. I told them if they were lucky they would only have to go to school half the week. And they were lucky. @ DATE3 they went to school and the rest of the week they went down because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they had time off for the rest of the week, now we were able to spend time together during the break. That night my grandmother made us barbecue chicken, au gratin potatoes, green beans, corn and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandmother's cooking and she is a chef at the school where she works. She is an extraordinary cook! @ DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot with air pistols. It would be me my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While trying to shoot an air pistol my friend @ PERSON6 told me I was shooting poorly. "@ CAPS3 am I shooting poorly?" I asked him. He told me he didn't really know and that I'm bad at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try and help me aim better. It was very embarrassing but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate when people try to help me when I don't want to. And that was one of the times. But he was a good friend of mine so it wasn't that bad. When we were done @ PERSON6 asked me to hold his air gun while he picked up something. He also told me that the security was on. So while I was waiting, I twirled the gun on one of my fingers and somehow shot him in the back. He panicked a bit and asked me why I shot him. “I didn't mean to say too. I was spinning the gun on my finger and somehow I shot you! In addition you said that the security was engaged! @ PERSON6 forgave me and told me it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw that our friends @ NUM1, @ PERSON3, @ LOCATION3, @ PERSON1 were laughing and my cousin @ PERSON4 too. @ CAPS4 confessed that he was the one who shot @ PERSON6 in the back. So @ PERSON6 decided he was going to shoot @ CAPS4. Then somehow it turned into a total shootout between all of us. I had a lot of fun that day. It's one of my favorite memories when I was there. While I was still at @ LOCATION4 my @ CAPS5 @ DATE4 asked if I could babysit for her. So, the next day after lunch, I let my little cousin @ PERSON2 play in the garden after I finished eating. My little cousin @ PERSON5 was taking a nap so I told @ PERSON2 that we can't be too loud. I decide to go play outside in the snow with him. After we were done, we decided to come home. We found ourselves locked out. Then I remembered that @ TIME1 when my @ CAPS5 was still at home, @ PERSON2 was playing with the lock. So I decided to take a tour of the house and try out the front door. He was locked too. @ PERSON2 told me the garage door can open, but he doesn't know the code. I felt really stupid. After a few more minutes, we went to one of their neighbors so I could call my @ CAPS5 as I didn't have their cell phone number. But the neighbor only had his house number. Then I called my dad so I could get his number. I told him what had happened and he laughed. @ PERSON5 was still taking a nap, so everything was fine. I called my @ CAPS5 and we waited for her to come home. She told me everything was fine and this happened to her twice while @ PERSON5 was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes before going out she would take a key with her to make sure the door was unlocked. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than that @ PERSON2 and I had fun outside. I had a great time while I was at @ LOCATION4. Just being at @ LOCATION4 is one of my favorite places. Especially when I'm with my friends and family.
"Laughs" @ CAPS1 @ MONTH1 people actually believe that only money can buy happiness, but happiness comes from the great things in life, and the greatest thing we have is laughter. Not only does it show kindness, happiness, and freedom, it makes you and others feel good. Laughing is one of the best feelings we can have, although it can hurt if it's too much. It can teach others a way to express themselves and to forget the hurt in life. Everyone can laugh and everyone can make others laugh. Without laughing, life would be so boring. But you never want to laugh, because even laughter has a limit. There are different ways in life to make someone laugh, and there are different ways to be funny. There are good ways to be funny and there are bad manners. A bad way to be the class clown, it gets boring, rude, and it can put you on the bad side of your teachers. A good way to tell a joke or embarrass yourself at times can work. It sounds like the worst, but if you laugh at yourself it can make you feel better, and you don't have to look at it as bad as you think. I know I can be funny sometimes, and sometimes I make myself laugh, but it's never good to laugh at someone and make them feel bad. Making someone else feel bad can make you look bad, and others @ MONTH1 don't see you as funny. You never want to put someone else down, people have feelings and hurting someone just makes you sound like the bad guy. The folks at @ CAPS1 think that happiness is in fairy tales, also in love, but when you really want happiness, turn to your friends and make them laugh. Making another person laugh is fun, and it helps build confidence and character. Having self-confidence and character really helps you in life, it brings more joy, love and others @ MONTH1 thinks of you better. It can bring people together and it can bring peace. You don't have to try to be funny to make someone laugh, sometimes laughter just pops up for no reason. Laughter could be an open way to win another heart. Being boring can make you feel like you're not an interesting person or that you're not really fun. When people fall in love, they find someone to share their life with. Sharing the laughter could help your relationship and make it stronger. All we really need in life is happiness and success, and with happiness and success comes laughter. I can also help you meet new and interesting people, @ CAPS2 you more and more friends in your life! With laughter, you really find the good part of life. There are a lot of adventures that life will take you through. I like to laugh, I feel better when I'm upset. Laughing makes me feel good inside and out. I also like to make others laugh. For example, how I met my best friend @ CAPS3. She was upset and she felt like nothing in the world was going well, I knew she was not happy and I didn't want her to feel that way. So as a friend I helped her and made her laugh at all the bad things and forget about them. Since then we've been best friends and she never felt like this again. Laughter is really a good thing to have, it brings happiness to all of us. And making people laugh makes you more interesting, being an interesting person makes life easier and less stressful. Sharing this amazing feeling is great and can make your life more stress free. Stress can slow you down, as can sadness. When I'm depressed I like to make myself laugh. Sometimes the little things in life are the greatest things in life. In my opinion, I think laughter is the greatest feeling you can give someone. Finding something so awesome is like finding meaning in life. No one really knows the meaning of life, and we never will, but having the ability to laugh and make others laugh is part of life and a privilege. So go out there and tell a joke or two, just make someone laugh and feel good.
A while ago I had a friend named @ PERSON4. We were best friends; like two peas in a pod. We hung out everyday, all day @ DATE1. One random day we went to our other friend @ PERSON1 to see if she could come out. We were all hanging out all day when @ PERSON1 had an idea. She wanted @ PERSON2 and I to stay at @ TIME1. We stopped at @ LOCATION1 so that she could pick up her clothes and then left for @ ORGANIZATION1. Along the way, we stopped, once again, at @ LOCATION2 and chilled for a while. We were there for @ CAPS9 @ NUM1 minutes just laughing @ CAPS9 all the crazy things that ever happened during @ DATE1 ! When we were finally cuddling to @ CAPS2, @ CAPS3 the older brother of @ LOCATION2 slammed @ PERSON1 on his butt and told him it was cool. We laughed at her the longest for that! Not to mention how @ CAPS3 kept talking about @ CAPS9 until he moved to @ ORGANIZATION2. When we left, @ LOCATION3, @ PERSON4 and I were singing to @ ORGANIZATION2's new @ CAPS5 when a random person stopped and asked for directions. Then I pointed him to where he was going and he said "@ CAPS6 you" and left. When he left @ PERSON4 looked at me and yelled "He was the sexiest guy I have ever seen @ CAPS7 !" @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 by the time we hit the @ CAPS10 on the road we saw the guy again. @ CAPS8 this time it wasn't that hot. He had a scruffy face and long, disheveled brown hair tied in a ponytail and dressed like a tramp. I, to this day, give it shit @ CAPS9. It was the best @ TIME1 of @ DATE1. We ended up going to @ CAPS11 @ CAPS12 to buy some drinks when @ PERSON1 started freaking @ CAPS9 losing her @ CAPS5. So we all had to retrace our steps to @ LOCATION2's house, hoping to find it. Retracing our steps, we came across this guy who tried to help us find him. At that time it was probably @ CAPS9 @ NUM1 @ CAPS14'clock @ LOCATION4. We eventually gave up and decided to go back to @ ORGANIZATION1. Before we even step foot in her front door, her mom runs out and starts yelling at @ LOCATION3. So her mom drove me back with @ PERSON4 to my place @ CAPS8 the moment I knocked on the door because it was locked and everyone was sleeping so we had nowhere to go. So for that @ TIME1 @ PERSON4 and I were stuck homeless. We walked around all @ TIME1. I almost fell asleep in the laundromat when I remembered my aunt @ PERSON3 looking at a small white truck for sale in the parking lot @ CAPS15. The truck had a bed in the back, no I don't know why, and it sounded better than the hard floor in the laundromat, so we crawled inside . It was a tight squeeze, @ CAPS8 we pulled it off. Besides, there were dirty socks and wee. It was, for sure, the worst thing @ CAPS7 had smelled. @ CAPS8 was without a doubt the most fun @ TIME1 I have had with this girl.
Because of you think that's part of the fun ? Well, Sam Times is no fun. Because you are in Adefokil Stoeshl. I think being in a relationship is always in Porto to trass the other prsad. for if there is not, there is no relation. the other plateau pepolp @ MONTH1 to kip then opert. he or the same people you can test. they will help you. If you are new to latecomers, you can get along with them. I had a good frand and that trusts me. confidence is good if you don't trust yourself. And at the same time, it's good in a ship. like for me i youso not tace us im brother. now i say abrething hem. before I am not true. because it allwes it wat big my mom the i will gat in trodol.now it is donation because of that. now it's fun hanging out with me. because he will have fun is a good idea. because you can go to a party, you can go out when you are frands. for me i will try to have fun. I am going to take me frand to go to parch and to go to the trunks. from there I'll go see my grandmother.
Everyone laughs differently, some people laugh so hard they cry, and some don't. But one thing they do have in common is laughter. People use laughter as a way to express their feelings of joy or happiness, or even if something is really funny to them. Laughing is a great way to feel happier about something, for example maybe you're having a bad day and a friend of yours comes up to you and tells you a funny joke. It makes you feel better, doesn't it? Having a good sense of humor is something that can get you through tough situations, embarrassing things, or even like I said just a bad day. Being able to laugh at yourself and even at something you might have done that was embarrassing is a good thing, it can help you get over it and not be so embarrassed about it. Every time I laugh I always feel better, laughing reminds me of all the good things in life. Laughing reminds me of the great times I had with my friends and family, it reminds me of all the jokes my friends and I have made up over the years that we can still laugh about as loud as before. I believe that laughing is good for everyone, it can make you feel better no matter what and some people even say that laughing makes you feel younger. When you laugh at certain things it creates lasting memories that you will never forget and when you talk about it again in the future you will always think it is as funny as it was before. Some of my best friends laugh about everything, they think every little joke is the funniest, their laughs are unforgettable, you can still hear them laughing. Which, in another way, shows how happy laughter can make anyone. If you think you are not a funny person just say something to one of them and I can guarantee that they will laugh at it and you will feel funny and probably start laughing too. I love spending quality time with some of my closest friends, and probably the best time I had with them was when we went to @ ORGANIZATION1 for the start of @ DATE1 before entering high school. . It was two days after our promotion (graduation) from college. We packed my family's car and set off for @ ORGANIZATION1. Not even half an hour into the car ride and we're already laughing at every little thing that happens. We always create great memories and this was already in the books for one of the best. I'm sure the car ride for my mom and aunt was just as fun, we sang songs and danced (as much as we could tie ourselves in a seat) to as many songs as we could handle during those two hours. Of course during the drive we were stopped by construction so we decided to jump out of the car and do a @ CAPS1 fire drill around it. All the other cars were looking at us and laughing at us, even the construction workers, although it was funny. We made a boring moment fun. Once we finally got there we had no hesitation in dropping off our bags and grabbing our bikes and taking off and exploring. It was so beautiful, not a cloud in the sky. During our exploration bike ride, we laughed, told jokes, and just talked about our excitement about leaving middle school and moving on to high school. The next day we decided we wanted to float down the river on a raft, which sounds like a fun idea. Well that would be if we actually knew where we were going, I did it with my family all the time so I had a sense of where to go but still five girls, two rafts and a river, maybe not such a great idea. During the whole river raft trip, we jumped between the two rafts, splashing every now and then with the oars. Knowing each other, we laughed all along the river. Whenever we walked past people I'm sure they thought something was wrong with us because of the way we laughed and enjoyed each other's company. By the time we finished the rafting trip we were hungry luckily my mom had packed lunch for us for our return home, when we sat down at the table we could never keep a straight face. What made it even funnier was that my aunt and mom didn't know what we were laughing at because we could just look at each other and laugh. You know you've built a great friendship when you can just look at each other and laugh, already knowing what your friend is thinking because of all the jokes you have with each other. All because of a little thing called laughter.
Laughter can be used for a lot of things. Either of them can be the important part of a relationship. There are several key elements in a relationship. But, the most important is certainly the part "laughter being the shortest distance between two people". Laughter from @ CAPS1 can heal the emotion of being sad. @ CAPS1 it does not cure it. If laughter is the shortest distance between two people, then if a boy or girl meets someone they love. For example, I have been to a girl before and found nothing to do or say. So, I just did my best to make her laugh. It took @ MONTH1 several days to really try to do this. But, in the end, I was more comfortable inviting her out and feeling more comfortable with her and her friends. @ CAPS3 I can make her laugh I always feel better about myself because it's never good to see her in a bad mood. Now on some occasions I've made people laugh and that doesn't mean anything. But, @ CAPS3 I make my daughter laugh so it was totally worth it. Because I can cheer her up for being sad or angry to make her happy and full of laughter. It @ CAPS1 also helps to be depressed. The fact that she is depressed is a bit like a collapsing train. It never turns out to be good. But @ CAPS3 she is happy, she can be full of joy, quite dizzy, and @ CAPS1 very spontaneous. I know @ CAPS1 being alone and laughing is good. But you can @ CAPS1 be called crazy if you don't care about anything at all. The best way to know someone is feeling better is to laugh. If they are laughing, then they can't be angry, sad, or any emotion other than happiness, or maybe sarcasm. But the sarcasm can be brushed aside as if nothing had happened. If I ever try to make people laugh with sarcasm, I always end up offending them. So I am always myself with everyone around me. So if you ever hear that laugh, it's the shortest distance between two people. You must know that it is true. Because not only do you get to a lot more places and get to know someone more. But, you can also learn valuable things about life by being closer to more people. @ CAPS3 you hear this phrase, ask yourself : "@ CAPS2 Am I able to make someone laugh? @ CAPS2 Am I able to laugh and be really close to someone ?" @ CAPS3 you do this, you will know that laughter is really the shortest distance between two people.
Each one entered, one after the other, forming a human train. The metallic red bell rang once as each person opened the door slightly. As I walked in I was enveloped in the smell of food @ CAPS1 and the conversations ringing in my ears. I took a few steps forward and stopped, not knowing where to go. To the right was a wall covered with @ CAPS1 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 symbols and meanings, while to the left were hundreds of tables already filled. Not knowing where to take my place, I turned to my mom. I wanted so much to collapse at one of the adult tables, even if it meant I had to sit there in silence. Moms knowing the best, she pushed me to the back of the restaurant, telling me to go sit with my cousins. I did as she told me, as always, but clearly expressed my reluctance. Walking towards the table with slug speed and my feet dragging on the floor, I stood awkwardly in front of the circular table. Yanking out one of the chairs, I turned to my mother with a pleading look as desperation filled every fiber in my body, for I knew there was no way she would give in. Looking at these six parents, I had no idea how I could manage to sit here the rest of the evening. We had all gathered at a @ CAPS1 restaurant for my grandfather's @ NUM1 birthday. Each of his children had flown from the continent to @ LOCATION1 in order to spend this special moment with him. I had not seen these cousins for over @ NUM2 years, some much longer. I had visited them before since we were at @ LOCATION1, but I hadn't talked to them much, nonetheless when we were all together and forced to mingle. With my towel on my lap, I sat down and looked at my cousins, each staring at me like I was an animal at the zoo. After a moment or two, they seemed to forget that I was there because they looked away and started talking to each other. The only person at the table that I didn't feel like a complete stranger with was my cousin, @ PERSON2. She had wavy brown hair with blinding blonde highlights, tanned by the sun on those bright tropical days, as well as that brown skin @ CAPS6 that made me jealous. We started talking, and soon I found myself enjoying the moment. It wasn't until the food arrived that we started to interact as a group. Being bland palate teenagers, everyone watched the waiter bring the first course. After asking the friendly waitress what we were about to eat, from her broken @ CAPS7, we deciphered that they were buns with duck inside. Frantically trying to get all the tables served at fairly constant intervals, she left our table and we all stared blankly at our food. No one wanted to take the first bite. One of my cousins, @ PERSON1, signed up to take on the male daredevil role. We all waited hesitantly as he nibbled on the wet bun and swallowed. Once the chewing was done, he smiled and it seemed that this dish had won his approval. As I rummaged through my buns, I began to wonder if maybe it was easy to relate to these people and if I had turned a little thing into a big ordeal. From there, I would just be myself and stop worrying about not having seen anyone in years; All I needed was to be myself. The way the dishes were organized left a lot of time to discuss between each plate brought. Since I no longer worried about what to say or how to say it, I easily integrated into the conversations and started to relax. Shortly after the duck platter was removed from the table, it was discovered that my cousin @ PERSON1, who is from @ LOCATION2, is saying certain words with an accent. Soon everyone started to compare the way we pronounce things to the way they do it. After every difference we found, we laughed. Things continued like this for the rest of @ TIME1, everyone was laughing about things that were only moderately funny, but we found it hilarious. It was at @ TIME1 when I realized that even though @ MONTH1 you are uncomfortable with a group of people you don't know very well, finding common ground helps you ease that discomfort. Finding something you all love to talk about @ MONTH1 is hard to do, but finding something that makes you laugh is much easier. Laughter is something everyone enjoys and can participate in, even if it doesn't contribute to the conversation. By feeling like you're a part of what's going on, you feel accepted, and that's all everyone wants.
People say that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. A @ ORGANIZATION1 I saw that @ CAPS6 was true when I met a girl named @ PERSON1. Three years ago I was in a town @ CAPS10 rocking, wondering if it would hurt if I jumped. I took the risk of @ CAPS15 and let go of the swing chains, flying through the air, noticing the unbalanced feeling of falling into @ CAPS15's chest, all slowing down, the temptation of what would happen when I touched the ground was vast. Sticking the landing was a failure and getting back up wasn't a big success either, until I felt the hands on @ CAPS15's shoulder and arm. I looked at the assistant @ CAPS15 and saw a girl. Not @ CAPS5 a girl but a gorgeous girl. A girl with dazzling green eyes that can keep an angry rhino from dashing towards her, hair fluttering in the wind, soft, soft skin that makes you think @ CAPS11 might be hurt for how soft she is. "@ CAPS1." It was all I could squeeze out. "@ CAPS1 are you okay ?" @ CAPS3 asked with a very worried tone. “@ CAPS4 I'm fine, @ CAPS5 forgot to glue the landing. Thanks for helping me, uh what's your name ? ” I came back with a @ NUM1, and your welcome. what's your name? " @ CAPS6 @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS3 laughed before @ CAPS3 said his name. "@ CAPS7, do you want to walk with me?" I had a hard time vocalizing. ”@ CAPS8, but I owe @ CAPS9 to @ CAPS10 because @ CAPS15 mom will be here soon.” @ PERSON1 said. While walking around @ CAPS10, we stopped at a monkey dome and started asking random questions the other person had to answer. I understood that @ CAPS3 was @ NUM2 years old, her favorite color was baby blue, and @ CAPS3 always wanted to be a doctor. we walked around the @ CAPS5 playground again talking about past memories or something that happened between them in the past, I asked him if @ CAPS3 had a sibling. his response was that @ CAPS3 had a brother and two sisters. As I listened to it, I noticed that @ CAPS3 was thinking very deeply and asked me what @ CAPS3 was thinking and @ CAPS3 quickly responded. "@ CAPS11, @ CAPS5, I wonder why I am so happy with you." “Well, I might make you feel good by laughing. Or it might be @ CAPS15 charms that work on you.” I responded with an @ CAPS12 accent. "@ CAPS13 @ CAPS4 that's definitely it. Said our goodbyes and @ CAPS3 is gone. I sat there watching the car go down the road and I was hoping we @ MOIS1 would see each other again, but somehow I knew we wouldn't because @ CAPS15 mom, and was moving from town to a small town halfway across the country. Turning around and walking back to @ CAPS15's house for the last night on the town all I could think of was her and how a little laughter became the @ CAPS16 of friendship.
When a day is called perfect, there are a lot of things that go into making it perfect. The most perfect days of adolescence are in the @ DATE3 beyond the stress of school. My perfect day wasn't in @ DATE3, nor on a crazy @ DATE4 break in @ LOCATION2. My perfect day was a @ DATE2 in the middle of @ MONTH1 through @ DATE1. It was on this perfect day that my friendship with @ ORGANIZATION1 was founded. A friendship that is now the best of all. A friendship based on moments of pleasure, memories, stories and laughter. At @ DATE1, I spent several weekends with @ ORGANIZATION1. However, none were as hot as this weekend at the end of @ DATE4. We decided we needed to calm down and with that said we left for @ CAPS1. Down the road we went with two redneck boys and a mutt in the bed of the truck. Getting to @ CAPS1 was special because I was so out of my comfort zone. It was also special because I hadn't met a single soul that @ ORGANIZATION1 was about to introduce me to. When I first laid eyes on @ PERSON1, @ PERSON3, @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON2, I couldn't understand how @ ORGANIZATION1 had met them. She is athletic, motivated, appropriate and intelligent. The boys who shook my hand were in stuff like big trucks, fishing rods, and a loud country band. I didn't think when meeting them for the first time that opposites could attract or love each other. Over the course of the day, I regained my comfort zone. As the hours passed and the jokes and laughs were exchanged, I realized how very similar we all were. I didn't think all the childish things we did at @ DATE2 in @ MONTH1 would matter to me months later, but it does. As we ran by the dirty stream with black lipstick painted like war paint and laughed so hard we cried, I realized how perfect the situation was. If that day hadn't made my lips and my mind laugh in her comfort zone, it would have long been forgotten. If you look back on every happy memory you have, there is always some common ground. A joke, or even a funny face, makes you laugh extremely loudly. Every time I cross @ CAPS1 I think back to a day when the sun was hot and we sat by the fishing rods and exchanged laughs. I think of @ ORGANIZATION1 and I running through the trees laughing and tripping on our own feet. I think of @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 laughing and pointing fingers as we tried to go swimming. After all the mad running and swimming we were pretty tired. @ PERSON1, @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON2 have asked us to take a walk ; so we accepted and we went into the bush. Less than five minutes after we left, we stopped walking. Our walk had put us at the top of a hill of small round pebbles. I don't know what events led @ LOCATION1 to push @ PERSON1 down the hill. However, I remember @ PERSON1 pulling @ PERSON2 with him. I also remember @ PERSON4 sliding down to join the battle. Watching three boys wrestle and play on a hill of slippery rocks was something like watching a movie about the fifties. No one was texting or joking with a machine. Around us, it was laughter and serenity that danced like music around us. The day was not stressed and there was perfect sunshine. It was like something we only dream of. Once you're in a time like this, where your own little world brings you closer together, you don't want to leave it. When you're about to laugh, you log out and for a few brief seconds your life is in its simplest form. You are just you, no rushed thoughts, no rushed emotions. You are just one person. I never thought that something as small as laughter could create or enhance a friendship. This @ DATE2, I realized that the laughs shared between @ ORGANIZATION1 and I would be the first memory of what was to come. Every event and every laugh that we had that day will be something I think of when I doubt people. It will always be a memory that will make me appreciate living. Someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. @ CAPS4 than @ DATE1 I wouldn't have believed it but laughing brought me closer to people I would have otherwise avoided. Laughs and smiles limited my world to @ ORGANIZATION1 and that of a few rednecks @ CAPS1. And from a @ DATE1 @ TIME1, it made all the difference.
Getting from place to place was always difficult, I hated the idea of never seeing friends or family. I was never the only word I could hang on to, there was no reason to hope it was a futile feeling. I knew that I would miss @ LOCATION1 a lot and @ ORGANIZATION1 was ringing so far ; twelve hours on the road seemed to me the end of the world. I have visited @ ORGANIZATION1 before, it was boring to tell the truth, and on top of that looking for a new home would bother me even more, all I could think of was @ LOCATION1. Now I was moving there! When I first heard about the move I was furious and tried to fight this bad decision, I was sure my parents were making a mistake. As hard as I was fighting, I couldn't win, my tears couldn't move my parents in the slightest way. Finally my departure was over and my legs were sore and tired, I didn't want to get up from my seat or even touch the floor of @ ORGANIZATION1. The floors were dirty and stained and the apartment complex was old and too busy, the rain and mud didn't help my attitude much either. Everything about this place was disgusting and the thought of sharing a room with my younger brother made my stomach ache. I stepped outside and walked into my apartment and went straight to my dark colored bedroom. I sat down and gathered my thoughts trying to figure out the pros and cons of my situation. The walls were crumbling on me and they seemed to take the form of bars, I was doomed to this fact that I couldn't escape until I became @ NUM1, and it was in over @ NUM2 year! I was stuck in my apartment for three days before wandering outside, but it wasn't that bad considering it was raining all the time even at the end of @ DATE2 which was abnormal for me. I didn't want to leave my room or apartment, all I wanted to do was watch @ DATE1 @ TIME1 cartoons in my room. I felt lonely and out of place, I had no friends to talk to, my parents didn't want to listen to me and my little brother was only @ NUM3 so he couldn't understand. There were no more smiles when I found out that I had to go to school the next day. Aloha Park looked like a school that had big funding and spoiled rich kids there, but it was actually the exact opposite. It was an older school with children who mostly lived in low income housing at the time. In some ways, it was rather heartwarming to know that I was temporarily living the same way. The first day of school was scary, it was my first major transition to a new, unfamiliar place. My teacher was old and cranky, she seemed to have a big chip on her shoulder. Suddenly, out of the blue, she held my hand in the hallway, which was humiliating and certainly not heartwarming. I heard my new classmates giggle and laugh when they saw me, I thought I would never make friends. The humiliation was bearable, but the thought of being in that class for the next nine months was an unimaginable fear. My teacher told me to sit across the room next to three boys, they all had the same expression which was an amalgamation of both insane confusion and territorial pride. The feeling of being intrusive would be an understatement for the new nervous sensation that had surrounded me. I sat down without realizing what actions the three boys might put me through, surprisingly the only event was a series of temporary stares and a freezing silence. As the day went on, life had become somewhat casual again, until the boys started talking about the opposite sex and my attention turned straight to them. I sat there and listened quietly and smiled at the inappropriate conversation that I clearly wasn't meant to participate in. They laughed and giggled and covered their mouths embarrassingly, as I looked at them and considered them comic arts lovers. I wanted to say something that I remembered throughout the conversation, then I took my chance to add one more important joke and quickly mumbled my overly inappropriate phrase. They looked at me in confusion and asked me what I said, I didn't know how they were going to take the joke but I risked another chance and repeated it. The group of boys fell silent and the only sounds were from the other students talking to each other, suddenly they burst out laughing. I was glad they had a sense of humor, and after that I had friends and @ CAPS1.
Laughter at his @ CAPS1 Laughter is an ability that everyone has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also change your day on all levels. The ability to laugh is of huge importance in this world. Without laughing, the days would be dull, sad and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laughing, it brightens my day, makes me smile and makes me laugh with them. By laughing, we become happier, learn more about others, and improve our bad days. I have experienced, first hand, the joys that laughter can bring after having had a hard time, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and keep in your life. Not everyone can have a good day all the time. Bad days do happen, and when they do, seeing a funny incident and laughing about it is what can change the whole day and make it great. Many people hear the statement " Laughter is the shortest distance between two people " or a statement similar to it and will never agree with it. Often times, we will laugh and disagree completely. It turns out that I was one of those people myself. Most days weren't the @ CAPS1 they could be, and having to go to school all day ruined it a bit more. People kept telling me that if I laughed every now and then maybe I would feel better more often, and I @ MONTH1 really have fun when I participate throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could an action as simple as laughing change my perception of everyday life ? The possibilities were just too improbable. I didn't think I would change my mind on this either, until a few years ago. It started off like any ordinary day, not so good. My hair was a mess, my sister @ PERSON1 and I couldn't stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke as we started our shopping spree at @ LOCATION1. I had decided it was going to be a terrible day because so far nothing had gone well. Over the course of the day, nothing worse happened, but nothing better either. @ PERSON1 and I continued to travel, shop, and shop. Finally, on our last stop, we saw a situation arise. As we sat at a stoplight, waiting for traffic to move, I spotted a strange man sitting all alone across the road. The man looked like he had a foot injury, and our suspicions were confirmed when he started to walk like an injured penguin, barely stirring his feet and rocking up and down as he walked forward. . The sight of this man made me smile, and when I reported it to @ PERSON1 she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I too began to crack. The man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had started to change my whole day. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. Laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more incredible. As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my perspective and beliefs about laughter changed dramatically. Laughter was actually the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I argued before the funny man arrived, after we finished laughing at him, we realized that within a few minutes we had become closer than ever. It's crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it has happened, and now is a memory that I will keep with me forever. I'm glad this happened because I started to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. I now think of laughter as one of the greatest hobbies to have and I do it quite often.
It was @ DATE1 the seventh and I had invited my two best friends, @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2, to go with me to my boyfriend's soccer game. It would be the first time for them to meet him since he went to a high school different from ours. Our plan was to get off the bus at my house, then my @ CAPS3 would get us to his game later. When we got to the end of the alley, we started walking to my house. Then all of a sudden "ahhhhhh, @ CAPS1 my god !" @ PERSON2 and I were both screaming at the top of our lungs: "@ CAPS2 has ... ahhhh !". @ PERSON2 and I had almost stepped on a dead snake lying in the alley. While this was going on, @ PERSON1 had no idea what the problem was or why we were screaming. We looked at her and saw a completely puzzled look on her face which we found absolutely hilarious so we burst out laughing. She quickly realized that we had been surprised by the snake and also started in "you are so funny @ CAPS2 just a dead snake". We talked and laughed all the way to my house. @ CAPS4 we had caught up a bit and I changed into my boyfriend's # @ NUM1 swimsuit, we went down to eat. We sat down at the table with our bowls of chili and started to eat. My @ CAPS3 came over and put down his bowl then went back to the kitchen to get something. When she came back she had napkins and another bowl, I asked her playfully "are you really hungry @ CAPS3?" she said "no .. uh why?" That's when the girls and I started laughing hysterically again, "@ CAPS3 you have two bowls you are obviously very hungry" I laughed. She turned a little red and then said " Well I love chili, I can never get enough of it " and then she laughed a little " you are probably right, I should start with a bowl ". @ CAPS4, we gathered the covers for the stands we left. On the way up, we made a stop at the famous @ ORGANIZATION1. I was so excited to see my boyfriend and bring my friends over that coffee probably wasn't the best idea but we stopped anyway. While we were there waiting for our coffee, we passed the time by making faces by the next window at people passing by. We were cracking up at the looks people were giving us, some looked like @ CAPS5 thought it was funny while others looked like @ CAPS5 thought we had escaped from a nut house. Soon our drinks were ready and we headed out the door. As we were walking towards the car, a guy whistled at us. We hopped in the car and lost it when we saw it was a guy who was dressed in one of those Statue of Liberty costumes. We were almost at school and I was full of energy from the mix of caffeine and excitement. My @ CAPS3 had never driven to @ PERSON3's school before, so my dad was only busy that night. I tried to keep my cool while giving her instructions in a very laughing way. I started by saying "you go straight here @ CAPS3" on my @ CAPS3 and the girls said "honey, you can't go straight here". "Yes you can" I argued then @ CAPS4 for a moment @ PERSON1 said "girl look, you could go straight but you won't see @ PERSON3 if you do". I realized @ CAPS5 was right and said to my @ CAPS3 "don't turn, just turn right" she got confused because I had misdirected the directions so she turned left. I started to panic, screaming "no no no! We need to turn around, I meant okay" @ CAPS5 everyone burst out laughing at me "man calm down woman we just need to turn around" said @ PERSON2. We finally got back on track and I tried to give clear indications. I wasn't quite sure where the stop for his school was, so I told my @ CAPS3 to go slow, when we passed him and freaked out again. "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS3 we need to turn around" @ CAPS5 all laughed at this, then my @ CAPS3 said she was testing me to see if I could be patient. We all laughed again. When we got there and jumped in to pay and enter. We got there in time to see the guys come out of the locker room. I got another dose of excitement, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 started walking away so I could wave @ PERSON3. I put on their shirts and begged them to stay because I didn't want to be the only person waiting. Then I saw him go by and before I knew it I jumped off the ground and waved my hand frantically. I saw him smile as he ran on the pitch, my friends laughed at the way I jumped and we enjoyed the game.
Outdoors @ CAPS1 In 6th grade I went outdoors @ CAPS1 Woke up very early and went to @ CAPS1 where the bus takes the students outdoors @ CAPS1. First of all, I'm embarking on the outside path @ CAPS1. Then they told us which cabin we were supposed to be in. I had seven cabin members, including myself. I brought my electronic device but the teachers told us we could not bring devices on the trip. The next day we did some activities. We had lunch first before doing activities. The foods we ate were pizzas, pizza pockets, and hot dogs, and then the activities we did were to catch fish and put them back in the water. I saw deer they were eating grass I was really tired then when we got back we were getting ready to go home. Finally, I would like to help and I really enjoyed my outing on the field.
The @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2 is one of the most important things in life. When I'm with my family, we all have such a good time together that we laugh all the time at the things or memories that we say we remember. While we are all gathered around the table, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner, we always have something fun to say and laugh about all the time. For starters, during breakfast @ DATE2 @ TIME1, we all had a great time eating in the first hour of @ TIME1, but suddenly, when my sister recalls what happened the night before at work, she just had to talk about it because she wanted us to know what happened so that we could laugh with her as well. She had said that there was a banana on the floor, when her manager passed by, she did not see it and slipped into the hallway. It was impossible not to laugh about it because it was the manager. Well @ TIME1 was passing by so fast just thinking about what happened with the banana and the manager that day. Whenever I remembered I would laugh so hard I couldn't stop. It was the funniest thing she's ever told us since she started working. However, at lunchtime, I was at school and my mother called me the same day. I answered quickly but without knowing why she was calling me. Suddenly she said "@ CAPS3 you won't believe what just happened your dog just finished showering and running like crazy on beds and diapers trying to dry himself off" I couldn't believe and I started laughing so hard that I had to tell my friends who were next to me and they too started laughing too. I could imagine in my head how funny it would be if I stood there watching her run like a mad dog. As the day went on all I did was remind myself how funny it was for a dog to do that, that I would suddenly laugh during class at the school, but even though it was something good to laugh about, I had to stop laughing because everyone was just watching. Finally, at dinner time, at the table that evening, we all told each other about our day. Everyone had something new to say but when my brother started telling us about his day at school he couldn't even speak because it was so funny he meant he was laughing correct. He stopped after a while and calmed down but not for long. He told us that during his lunch break he went to the bathroom and when he got out he noticed all of his friends were laughing and pointing at him. He said he had no idea what was going on but when they told him that when he got out of the bathroom he had a big piece of toilet paper stuck to his pants. I immediately thought he would have been embarrassed, but instead he said he thought it was also funny. My parents, sister and I started laughing so hard that we even forgot about our dinner sitting in front of us just lying cold on the table. Laughter is one of the most important things in life. Without laughing every day, it just wouldn't be the same. Being able to laugh during the day is very important because it's like another way to spend the day and look forward to the next. We all said at the end that our day had passed so quickly that it was or might not be true that the day was over and it was time to go to bed. @ DATE1 third day was one of the many days that was the best and that we all enjoyed and had fun laughing with each other talking about funny things that happened to us during our day.
I was raised with two brothers who represent the world to me until my little sister was welcome to the world year @ DATE1 I am the second baby of seven children most of my family have passed in the other world where I know they will be better. Now I've been locked up since I was twelve and a half, it's been four years since I have been away from my family and haven't been to the funeral that I missed, I can never cry at a funeral , the only one I cried for will just have to be my mother's passing within the year @ DATE2 I can never forget the women who brought me and the others into this world before she didn't die, she didn't want me, my brother and my little sister to have separated from each other but that didn't happen my brother was put with my grandfather and me and my little sister were sent with our grandmother i didn't feel the same i can't see my little sister growing up seeing my brother's having their first child and especially seeing my new nieces and nephews being welcome in this world, even watching them grow up in the same world as me. Dude I remember when it was just me and my brother together at @ LOCATION1, where it was all the fun times getting in trouble, running in a park, meeting new people with both parents one wo full mom and awesome dad didn't have to worry about a thing but just had fun until one night my dad hits my mom and that's when there is had more fun times my world turned upside down but more times like this i realized i have to protect my family make sure no one ever hurt my family like how my mom got hurt of all the manners i will tell you a fun time about my young year just one day my brother just had a good idea oh lets go cut our hair i cut my brother's hair and both made me put on my hair didn't fall out until my mom gave me a bath she went to get a towel and what do you know you see all my hair in water and it looks like a boy's hair is cut, this all happened when I was only in first grade, I will never forget that moment with me and my brother did when mom was gone to work man i will never forget my mom face she did when she saw my hair probably because my hair was down to my butt well that's the story of a girl from sixteen years old @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2.
Laughter is the key to happiness. It was a moment that many people remember. You share a lot of laughs with your friends, family, and sometimes strangers. When you laugh with someone, it shows you have something in common; you both think that something is funny and that it could build a strong relationship. To me laughing means a lot, I laugh every day. I won't forget the moment when I was really mad at my dad and then the laughter solved the problem. One night my dad and I were in my house in the kitchen and he was arguing with me about my grades. I told him I could always fix them that there was a solution. He called me a liar and anger built up. He was so hard-headed and I couldn't understand his thoughts. He said that I couldn't fix what I had done: what is done is done. I was getting really angry, I wanted him to go away and I thought I was never going to talk to him. We lacked confidence and I just wanted to tell him he was wrong. I knew he would get even angrier and we were going to yell at each other eventually. It made me so angry that he couldn't listen. My dad said he wanted the best of me, and he was disappointed. I was really sad because my dad was the kind of guy who would tell jokes and tease everyone. He always made my day by making me laugh. Usually when he got me in trouble it ended up being a joke at the end. The jokes he made when I was sad or angry would strengthen our relationship; we always end up laughing. Later that night we were with my whole family cutting my niece's cake and my dad and I were not talking. As we sang happy birthday, I looked at him and looked down. He looked at me like he was all hard. Then we would all say “-í @ CAPS1 le sople!” Which means blow out the candles in @ CAPS2. All of a sudden my uncle accidentally put out the candle and my dad and I looked at each other and laughed so hard. We were crying with laughter and we couldn't stop laughing. It was great to laugh at the same thing and share a moment together and put our anger aside. My dad tried not to laugh, but the more he tried, the louder his laughter was. It was only me and him who were laughing, everyone was laughing. By improving my father and my relationship, it created a bond between my family and me. It's a memory that will last a lifetime, but it was an important part of my dad and my relationship. Even though he was still upset with my grades, everything was better. There was a connection between us and we could always look back and laugh about it. I don't know what it was the night I found the incident so funny. As it made my relationship stronger, the distance between me and him didn't matter, it was all built on memory. Something he and me both share, building a part of him and a part of me. Our problem wasn't fixed but it was like it didn't matter, like laughing makes you change and helps us put it aside. Every moment of laughter that we have now is something he and I share, it is now a connection. We can both laugh at the same things and share our thoughts that make us stronger. Telling me that while he and I laugh about things is just putting more negatives aside and making life more meaningful. When you know you're happy, that's when you have a good sense of humor. Also when you have those moments with others that you will never forget. The moment you made laughing a big part of your pass. When all of those fun times become important because that's when you showed you were happy. It's even better when you laugh most of the time because your memories will all be remembered as a happy moment. I know sometimes I'll have times when I'm not laughing, but the key is to always look on the bright side. Even though my dad and I were mad at each other, it's a memory that will stay with me forever.
@ CAPS8 families @ DATE1 in @ LOCATION1 was one of exploration, but also one in which we came to regret our move from @ LOCATION3 a bit. We missed our friends, our relationships, but also places. The place where brother @ CAPS8 and I happened to miss the second one behind our farm was a @ CAPS3 that we had nicknamed "The @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS3". The place itself was a dumping ground. Near a dairy farm, it reeked of cow dung mixed with cigarettes. I remember the grass was perpetually dry and the bridge crossing the @ CAPS3 kept creaking; it was an old covered bridge, and on its last stop. So, it wasn't so much the place that we missed, but the happy memories associated with our special place. One particularly sad day our dad woke us up from our rooms saying we were going to explore a new @ CAPS3. We knew the adventures of @ CAPS4 ; we called them "@ CAPS4-ventures" because they were so unique. Most of the time we would find ourselves miles away from civilization and stuck in the car with our lunch out of reach. Even at our young ages, we had come to be wary of "@ CAPS4-ventures". @ CAPS7, our mom was able to wake @ CAPS8's brother and I, and we were quickly rushed into the car. During the trip, our father was unbearably cheerful. While @ CAPS8's brother and I were in the back of the car, languishing in our beautiful and comfortable bedrooms, @ CAPS8's father had the audacity to laugh over the radio and open the car windows. to our protests. On horseback with Brother @ CAPS8 and me in the back, there were two circular pieces of rubber that had been inflated. I would soon learn that these were called inner tubes and could be used to drift down the @ CAPS3. After what seemed like hours on the road, we came to a place called "@ LOCATION2 bend". Brother @ CAPS8 and I jumped out of the car and met a pristine beauty. Covered in shade, the @ CAPS3 was sinking loudly, and we could hear it even though we weren't that close to the @ CAPS3 bank. The grass was green and velvety beneath our feet, and the smell of the cool water springing from the land was delicious. The light filtered through the trees and had a crystalline effect on the water. @ CAPS8's brother and I rushed into our swimsuits, while @ CAPS8's father started hauling our food and supplies into the @ CAPS3 bank where we would be spending the day. As soon as we finished dressing Brother @ CAPS8 and I chased after him as it was a hot day and the water looked good and cool. When our hunger was satisfied, it was time to remove the inner tubes. The water was nice and quick, with some flowing water and a very small waterfall at the end. Being a rather short kid for @ CAPS8's age, even these little obstacles looked like the most insidious of the rapids, and they made @ CAPS8's eyes widen a bit. @ CAPS7, I managed to stabilize myself and prepare to get wet. At @ DATE1 I held onto the tube @ CAPS8 with tight fingers and wild eyes, but gradually I relaxed. I let @ CAPS8's hand drift to drag behind me in the water, drawing circles as sunlight filtered through the trees. As the water rose faster, I started to feel apprehensive again. I took deep breaths as the small waterfall approached me. It was actually only about four feet tall, but in the panicked haze of @ CAPS8 those four feet looked like twelve feet. The white water suddenly fell on me, accompanied by a great and frightening cry that I uttered. Somehow I managed to stay afloat, and @ CAPS8 ride left me with a smile. I burst out laughing, laughing at the homesickness and heartache of @ CAPS8. @ CAPS8's brother came down from the waterfall spitting and laughing, and we laughed together. Our laughter healed us, and for the @ DATE1 time since the move we have felt totally and completely at home.
Fall in love, @ CAPS3 @ CAPS1 The fall was easy, I remember the minute I fell in love with you. Everything about you was shining, everything about you was shining. You were infinitely beautiful in my eyes. We had the most fun human beings could ever have. Whenever we were together, I didn't think we weren't happy together, I didn't worry that you would go away someday. I never wanted to imagine life without you. As a kid I always had the title of the kid who smiled all the time, @ CAPS4 when I thought of you I had that glow. Everyone saw it. they were asking, "@ CAPS2 did you do it? You are so happy, I've never seen you like this before." That, @ CAPS2 that they saw in me was the power of love. @ CAPS4 something they didn't see was @ CAPS2 we had together. When it was just me @ CAPS3 you @ CAPS3 one of us would do something @ CAPS3 neither of us could stop the laughter. When our stomachs hurt so much from @ CAPS1. it's @ CAPS2 that I love, I have learned to love every part of you. Especially your laughter. From @ CAPS2 I hear they say laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I agree. Being able to laugh with someone, @ CAPS3 being able to be yourself @ CAPS3 not having to hold that forehead is magic. It's something that makes a relationship last. I guess it's kind of like glue in the sense. My brother @ CAPS3 I'm the closest you can get to best friends, @ CAPS3 guess @ CAPS2 we do in our free time ? We laugh. He's someone I can be dumb @ CAPS3 stupid @ CAPS3 goofy with @ CAPS3 he always laughs, @ CAPS3 he still loves me. :) @ CAPS4, although he is my brother he still has the same respect, @ CAPS1 is awesome. It is also an anti-stress. My teacher told me. He's my health teacher.
Laughter is an important part of any relationship, whether the person is a parent, friend, or someone you are dating. Laughter makes you forget your worries and problems. But with a friendship based on laughter, when do you trade giggles for seriousness? I believe laughter is vital in a friendship. But to have a strong and healthy relationship, you also need a level of seriousness. It's the story of how I learned to balance laughter and seriousness in one of my most important relationships. Olivia has been my best friend for as long as I can remember, hanging out together we laughed constantly. Laughter has always been a big part of our friendship and always will be. But on entering college, we were faced with dramas and boys and arguments, which we never experienced with each other. All of these small but important things to us then added up and started to pull us apart. Our lack of sharing our feelings and instead showering them with laughter caused us to repress anger towards each other. I always thought we were a perfect match with best friends because of our countless internal jokes and the constant fun we would have. But our anger grows until we are ready to deal with it, which we then did not understand. We started going out less and less and our daily calls became weekly. We both noticed a change in our friendship, but weren't sure how to fix it, we apologized for fighting and sympathized for our boyhood issues, but it wasn't the same. I missed her, but the longer it lasted the easier it was not to talk or hang out. Summer is here and our moms have planned for me to stay with her for a week while my parents were on vacation. To put it nicely, I was far from thrilled, how was I supposed to stay a week there when we hardly spoke anymore? I knew everything would be fine, but still worried that the week would be constant fights instead of laughs. Finally, the day came and my parents were driving me to her house. When I got there things were going well, we pretended nothing had happened and we had fun, it was like that for a few days. But on the third day, she broke the ice, asking what was wrong and why we aren't talking anymore. That day something amazing happened, we talked about all our feelings and what upset us. It was a bit awkward at first but we got through it together. The fights got less and less because we knew the things that bothered us, and everything slowly got better than before. This conversation changed our relationship forever and I'm so glad she spoke up when I didn't, otherwise we wouldn't be as close as we are today. That day was @ DATE1, but it had a huge impact on our friendship. Since we took this step in our friendship, I also knew better how to be more open with others. Olivia taught me so much, but it was one of the most important lessons. Laughter is an integral part of any strong relationship, but you also need to be able to share your feelings and be serious. Everyone needs a best friend to laugh with and I'm grateful mine stays with me no matter what.
Laughter is an important part of a relationship. It shows chemistry in a relationship and it shows happiness in family and friends. How depressing would it be if everyone didn't have a laugh ? It would be like the "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4". The happy laughter that binds relationships allows you to get to know someone better and show them that you have a warm heart. Ideally, when a person is warm at heart, your conscience tells you so, you can trust them. The talent for laughing is a good element to have when meeting someone new and spending time with your family. On the last @ DATE1 my youth group and I went on a mission trip to @ ORGANIZATION1, @ LOCATION1. We were going to reach out to many new kids as we hosted a @ ORGANIZATION2 for a week in the small town @ CAPS5. We picked the kids up from their home and drove them to @ ORGANIZATION1 to play games and sing songs. As we met each child one by one, it was important to give them a warm smile and laugh with them. If we had come to their neighborhood with our faces serious and straight in our big white twelve-passenger vans, it would send a different message to the children. Instead, we decorated our cars with Crayola car paint markers and energetically popped up vans with big, shiny smiles. We ran to a house door, rang the doorbell, and asked parents if their kids wanted to come to our @ ORGANIZATION2. We had to remember that these children live in poverty and have been through a lot. To share the gospel, it was important to show them we were sympathetic so that they could open up to us and let us tell them about @ CAPS6. When we laughed with the children, their eyes always smiled and twinkled. A lot of the kids just needed love and we did it by laughing with them and making jokes on each other. Certainly our youth group has changed the lives of children. Our @ ORGANIZATION2 is probably one of the biggest highlights of the year for them. In @ ORGANIZATION1, the appearance of the city is flat like a desert, there are no playgrounds, parks or places they can go and have fun. @ CAPS8 has empowered us to share the gospel with these children and give them a fun @ DATE1 they will remember. @ CAPS8 opened the hearts of the children of @ CAPS5 to @ MONTH1 to hear the word of @ CAPS8. Honestly, I don't think we could have contacted them if we hadn't been a friendly bunch. It just goes to show how important it is to laugh with each other, whether with strangers or with your family. If there is no laughter in your family, something is wrong. It's a sign of broken relationships and a feeling of closeness that is being lost. In the advertisements, there are always advertisements where families are around a table or in a restaurant laughing together. Not everyone has to look like this perfect family image every day, but when a family laughs with each other, it shows the unity they have. Usually when people laugh, they do it because they understand the situation and respect each other. Of course, a family doesn't have to be related, it could be your youth group, friends, or anyone you feel close to and comfortable with. Your comfortable person could even be your future spouse. My cousin's story of how he met his wife is like a scene from a girl's movie. My cousin, @ PERSON1, was working at a ski resort at the rental counters waxing skis, when a dark haired brunette walks up to him in her baggy snow pants and says, "I can get down the most. big hill "with the most flirtatious eyes and smile. Now @ PERSON1 was very confused as to why this girl was approaching him and actually telling him that. But @ PERSON1 was fascinated by this gorgeous girl and all he could say was "@ CAPS9". The girl seemed very happy with her response and asked her when her next shift was. An hour later @ PERSON1 and this girl were having lunch together in the cafeteria. Turns out that girl's name is "@ PERSON2". Apparently @ PERSON2's friends spotted @ PERSON1 first and told @ PERSON2 the guy had a good laugh and looked like a good person. They urged @ PERSON2 to invite him out and get to know him. @ PERSON2, being the daring, agreed. @ PERSON1's story proves that laughter is important. You don't know @ CAPS2 @ MONTH1 hears you and how that person might affect your future. Laughter is an important part of your life. It brings out joy in people's minds, gives you the opportunity to meet new people and maybe change their lives. It reflects @ CAPS2 who you are and changes the atmosphere around you. After all, we wouldn't want our world to look like "@ CAPS1's Laughter @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3", right ?
Laughter is part of life. It can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it's in bad taste. There was a time when me and my cousin @ PERSON1 didn't really love each other but had to stay at his place because my mom wasn't in town. After that night we were closer than our brothers and there is a huge funny story behind it. I was really reluctant to even go that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and try to have fun. When I got there we pretty much watched @ LOCATION1 in awkward silence. Then his parents informed us that they were going out and that they would not be back until very late. About ten minutes after they leave, my cousin @ PERSON1 turns to me and says " you want to do something really fun ". @ CAPS1 I was at the young age of thirteen and couldn't help but be interested. So I asked him what this funny thing was and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and cut through his field to the mulberry wall that surrounds his field and he showed me a little path through a certain place. After passing through the bushes we found ourselves on a gravel road that led to a house surrounded by a lot of land. And on the earth was what my cousin identified as passed out goats, I had no idea what the passed out goats were. So my cousin said he should just show me what they are and what they do. @ PERSON1 approached these goats and made a sudden noise, about a quarter of them fell stiff and still. I was laughing at the fact that these goats passed out when they got scared. We spent about forty-five minutes scaring them and watching them pass out. No matter how many times we did it, we found it no less fun than the first time. By far the funniest thing that happened that night started when @ PERSON1 informed me that he brought @ NUM1 fireworks. We put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked and lit it. It exploded and the bang was as loud as a gunshot. As one entity, the goats all collapsed and we burst out laughing, that is, until the people of the house came out. We ran as if our life depended on it, we flew over the road through the blackberry path, across the field and straight into @ PERSON1's house. We sat on the sofa then we looked at each other, we burst out laughing, my ribs hurt, I was dizzy from laughing. Her parents came home about a minute after we calmed down, which we also found extremely funny. As soon as they went to bed we burst into silent laughter. It was one of the most fun times I had with my cousin and even though we did not like before, we eventually become brothers of all but blood, but we were cousins therefore may be even a little by blood but above all laughing brothers.
Laughter is an amazing thing. Laughter is bilingual. It doesn't need to be translated or looked up in a dictionary. It is the only form of communication that we all know and understand. Laughter has the limit @ CAPS9. @ CAPS5 was the most silent girl in the whole school. In the morning and during lunch, @ CAPS5 would hide in the shadows, hoping not to be seen by the world. @ CAPS4 @ CAPS10 asked @ CAPS8 what @ CAPS5 wanted to be, @ CAPS5 would say invisible. People walked past @ CAPS8 without even a glance, thinking that @ CAPS4 I can't see @ CAPS8 that @ CAPS5 can't be there. My heart was sad for the poor girl because I knew @ CAPS5 needed a friend. Someone @ CAPS5 could talk to, or at least get a smile. However, how would I approach @ CAPS8 ? @ CAPS5 would he think I was crazy ? I knew there had to be a way to get @ CAPS8 to talk, or at least smile. As I entered school on @ DATE1, the hallway was filled with the same hubbub as usual. Paper planes were flying in one direction and mouths were going in another. I used to be pushed around and dodge things on the way to class. It was just the fun trip to get to your @ DATE1 period. Finally, as me and my gangly self came to the fourth period, I sat down and started looking for a pencil. While doing this, I noticed that someone would pull up a chair @ DATE1 for me and sit down. It was the girl! I didn't even know @ CAPS5 had this class with me, let alone just sit @ DATE1 for me. I began to be overwhelmed with joy, knowing that this might be my chance. Also, I started to think of ways to start a conversation with @ CAPS8. I noticed a picture on the front of the @ CAPS8 binder that someone had drawn. At the bottom was the signature @ CAPS8. I asked @ CAPS8 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 had drawn this picture. “@ CAPS1,” @ CAPS5 said in a very calm voice. My heart was pounding, almost freeing from my chest. I knew I had to say something more. "@ CAPS2", I started, "I think @ CAPS10 is a really good artist. Does @ CAPS10 have any other photos?" "@ CAPS1," @ CAPS5 repeated, "however, they're all at home." " Is it possible that @ MONTH1 can see these other photos of yours ?" " I said happily. "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS10 would love, @ CAPS10 are more than welcome to come to my house after school today and see them." @ CAPS5 said in a very happy voice. “I would be honored,” I say. At the end of the conversation, the teacher started lesson @ CAPS8. @ CAPS5 was a really nice girl, I thought to myself. I couldn't wait for @ DATE1 to end. When school @ DATE1 ended, we hit it off in the foyer. I could tell @ CAPS5 was very excited. I was excited as @ CAPS2 because I knew @ CAPS5 was finally feeling confident with herself ; like a baby bird flying from its nest for the first time. We drove to @ CAPS8's house in my mighty truck mule. I got very nervous as we walked to the front door. When @ CAPS5 opened it, my pounding heart flew from my chest. The house was absolutely beautiful. It smelled like fresh cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I couldn't believe what was in front of my eyes. My mind couldn't figure it all out. @ CAPS8's mom yelled from the other room, "Is this @ CAPS10 honey?" "@ CAPS1 mother," @ CAPS5 replied, "I have a friend in my house." "@ CAPS7 !" exclaimed mother @ CAPS8. We had cookies and milk with @ CAPS8's mother, then we went up to the @ CAPS8 room. The @ CAPS8 room was filled with so many beautiful designs made by @ CAPS5. @ CAPS5 told me there was a story behind each of them that inspired @ CAPS8 to draw it. @ CAPS5 asked @ CAPS4 I've done a drawing before. "@ CAPS9", I said, "I am what @ CAPS10 calls a challenge in the art world." We both started to laugh; however, we both started to draw a picture. In the midst of it all, I looked at @ CAPS8's photo. It was a beautiful drawing of a fairytale world filled with castles and dragons. Then @ CAPS5 looked at my photo. It was a failed attempt to draw a simple sunset with clouds and birds. We looked at each other and then started laughing hysterically. "The clouds of @ CAPS10 like potatoes," said @ CAPS5. Then we laughed even harder and continued laughing for what felt like an hour. Finally, when I left the house and came home for the night. I realized something amazing, something that I had forgotten. It doesn't take much to reach out to someone who needs a friend. I also realized that this may be the simplest thing that can make @ CAPS10 laugh ; like a bad drawing. This is because laughter is contagious and we all know we all love to laugh.
"Laughter is the shortest distance between two people", the quote @ CAPS3 can be accepted by everyone on @ LOCATION1. Everyone loves to laugh and have a good time. Especially @ CAPS1 with someone you care about. @ CAPS1 is something you and someone else can easily do together. @ CAPS3 brings two people together and brightens a person's life. Some people, like me, are always looking for a guy who can make me smile and laugh. I need to know that arguing will not be the main part of the @ CAPS3 relationship. Having someone who makes you laugh is a key factor in life. At the age of sixteen, I had my first boyfriend. I was the girl who kept rejecting guys and telling them I was trying to wait for the perfect guy. In the @ DATE2, I met @ ORGANIZATION2. Even though he was older than me and we might be opposites, he still knows how to make me smile. My first impression of him was his cute smile. After getting to know him and talking to him on the phone several times, I realized that I was starting to have feelings for the boy @ CAPS3. Every time we spoke he always had me @ CAPS1. I found @ CAPS3 to be very appealing. Having someone who brings some sunshine into my life made me feel like I was on top of the world. On @ DATE1 there was a football game, @ ORGANIZATION1 (two rival schools). During @ CAPS3, he and I still weren't dating. That day I invited him to come over so that we could watch the game together. I had already told him how much I love stuffed animals. That day he showed up with a fluffy stuffed animal. We were walking around the trail, @ CAPS2 all of a sudden I tripped. My first reaction was to use my nervous laugh. He had his arm around me and whispered in my ear "I'll never leave you @ DATE3." I turned cherry red. From that day forward he will remember me as the awkward girl who stumbles all the time. Now that I think back to the day I realize how funny that memory was. Thinking back on embarrassing times is always a good thing in a relationship. @ CAPS2 you are looking for someone who you want to spend the rest of your life with together, you have to make sure you like him for who he is. You don't want them to change. The point is to be able to spend time with someone who you can have a good time with and make jokes. I always tell my friends, "@ CAPS1 is a great abs workout." Which is true because every time I laugh my abs are always sore the next day. Being able to have a good time with friends and laugh at random things is always something I look forward to. If there is no @ CAPS1, it means I'm not having a good time. But luckily I have amazing friends who make jokes about everything. Whenever I'm with them there's never a moment @ CAPS2 I'm not @ CAPS1. Being able to make others laugh is a great characteristic in a person. @ CAPS2 you meet a new person, you prefer to have an awkward silence? Or do you prefer someone who will make you laugh? Hope we get the same answer because I hate awkward silence. I need to know that the @ CAPS3 person will make me laugh and smile and not make me think "@ CAPS2 can I go ?" @ CAPS3 is one of the worst situations you want to go through, I can say @ CAPS3 from personal experience. Even though I'm not the best at telling jokes, I use all of my awkward moments and this is how I get people @ CAPS1. I do not care, I am quite the opposite. I laugh with them. I know I'm goofy, I know I have my moments, and if these things can make a person smile, then that's fine with me @ PERCENT1 okay. My goal is to be able to make people smile @ CAPS2 they are down. So instead of playing a joke, I just remind them of an embarrassing thing that happened to me. Each is unique in its own way. This is what makes everyone special. Different people have different ways of making other people laugh. And once a guy makes a girl laugh, that's the first sign @ CAPS3 was right for him. Having someone who can make you smile is a key factor in life. @ CAPS1 means you are having a good time. @ CAPS1 brings people together. @ CAPS1 can brighten up a person's life. So the next time you meet someone, maybe a joke here and there will help break the ice.
My mom always says laughter is the greatest doctor and that's true for me anyway. Whenever I get sick or hurt myself I always laugh at a good joke and it makes me feel a little better every time my family goes on a long trip, we always make jokes and we soon tease the trip doesn't seem that long at all. it's very short and you wish it could be longer. One night my family and I were coming home from the store and my brother asked "what are we for dinner tonight" "the hambugers", she told us that my brother was a little freaked out because we didn't have @ ORGANIZATION1's and my mom said it's ok and my dad was in a little store called @ CAPS1 then jumped in the car and started driving home. "I fancy having some mexican food tonight can we eat at @ ORGANIZATION2 tonight" my mom asked "no i thought we had burgers tonight" he replied "we didn't have no @ ORGANIZATION1 "my mom laughed. Then my dad stopped the car and looked around "why" we all asked "we don't have @ CAPS2 from @ ORGANIZATION1 at least crisps" and then we all started laughing. Once we got to the place and found a place to sit we were all talking and my sister burst out "look daddy I can move the straw by looking at her" and she looked at the straw in the cup and everyone was silent. I knew it wouldn't move so I tapped the straw so she could move "ha look it moved" she laughed knowing she hadn't moved the straw. my mom was trying to hold back the laughter because my dad thought for a second that she could move the straw just to look at her. “Can't believe I fell in love with this” we finished our meal and walked home laughing and joking the whole way. Laughter can bring people closer to family, friends, even enymeys sometimes I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe as well. laughter brings fun in life and knowing that other people have the same interests and that you @ MONTH1 earn a friend you never know just like my family and @ LOCATION1's trip everyone laughs. When it snowed one day I etched my cell phone and gathered the neighbors my brother and sister and went to the park together we had this idea to have a mixed snowball fight to capture the flag. We all picked our bases and what kind of flag we wanted and then started the game we had fun playing, we were laughing so hard it hurt and shortly before we knew it I got to know my neighbor better after that day we talked we understood each other better and we understood each other better next time we have a snowball fight, hope she is on my team and we will win for sure.
My cousin @ PERSON1 and I are constantly sick of laughing, he is the funniest person I know. He's hilarious when he's not trying to be. I believe that is why he is so funny @ NUM1king. @ PERSON1 is a hardcore alcoholic, always drunk or drinking. In the rare event that he doesn't do either of these two options, he's the most annoying, depressed, and angry man there is. Give him a drink or two and watch it turn into fun @ CAPS1. @ PERSON1 and I have a wonderful time when there is an alcoholic beverage in or near his hands. @ CAPS5 is kind of an inspiring thing to see this transformation happen. It starts out as this sad, depressed, sober sociopathic lion in a cage at the zoo with so many pitiful, sour, pitiful excuses from society for the men and women pointing, laughing and sobbing at this poor lion. When one of those "people" throws a beer their own way, they grab @ CAPS5 in their fierce, angry teeth and devour a @ NUM2 oz tallboy from @ CAPS2 in seconds - can and all! He then stands up on his gigantic feline paws and lets out a surprisingly deep vibrato of a purr. His big, ferocious cat teeth then smile like a lion @ LOCATION1, as his sick, beastly, bloodstained fur slowly transforms into the scaly, scarred skin of a man. As he stands there with a silly, silly smile, he shouts "I @ CAPS3 @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1 !!" @ CAPS5 is truly an amazing thing, I have seen @ CAPS5 so many times and absolutely find @ CAPS6 only one word to describe this wonderful reconstruction of a living creature. Then, with drinks in hand, we will continue to have a great evening of unknown comedic fun. I guess you could say that laughter is a big part of our relationship.
One day my friends and I went to a friend's house and we started playing @ CAPS1 box, we were laughing and having a good time. My friend @ CAPS2 started telling jokes and all my friends started laughing hysterically. My friend @ CAPS3 was drinking milk at the time and @ CAPS5 laughed so hard that milk started to come out of his nose, it was also funny but disgusting at the same time. @ CAPS6 was the saddest of the whole group that was there we all asked him, @ CAPS4 was @ CAPS5 so sad @ CAPS5 replied that @ CAPS5 had heard his girlfriend wanted to break up with him. So @ CAPS5 asked us how to keep her interested, and we said @ CAPS5 should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. @ CAPS5 said @ CAPS5 would think about it @ CAPS6 was a really funny and awesome person to hang out with, so we didn't really care, we thought everything would be fine. So after everything @ CAPS5 is gone and we started hanging out in my friend's living room, @ CAPS7. We were hanging out and just talking about who the sexiest girl in school was. So an hour ago and my friend @ CAPS6 came back. @ CAPS5 came over to sit with us and shouted that I hadn't worked dude, I was okay calm down, @ CAPS9 has happened I asked ?. @ CAPS5 said she didn't think it was funny she thought I was stupid and just plain stupid. Oh did she really say silly that's not what I'm saying I thought she knew everyone laughed no @ CAPS6 I was joking with you man don't get mad now. So @ CAPS6 left after @ CAPS5 yelled at me, @ CAPS5 left and we all started laughing, I thought @ CAPS5 was right but hurt and @ CAPS5 would get over it. an hour later and my phone starts ringing and I'm looking at who's calling and it's @ CAPS6's ex-girlfriend. Surprised I answer and tell her that @ CAPS6 was not with us that I would tell her to call you later, I said because @ CAPS5 would use my phone to talk to her, but then she replied that ' she wanted to talk to me so I was okay so we started talking and she tells me that she likes me ... I start to laugh out loud. She got very sad and angry with me because of my laughter. But I said it was cool that she did it so I told her I had to go and we hung up ... that all day
Laughter is extremely important in maintaining a relationship with someone or even a group of people. Some very beneficial uses of laughter include relieving tension in any intense or high pressure situation, as well as connecting with other people in a more meaningful way. Involving laughter is also a great way to make new friends. In my opinion, healthy relationships, be they friendship or even more, hardly exist without laughter and cannot flourish without it. Personally, I use laughter on a daily basis for these reasons among many others and it is a monumental part of my relationship with the father side of the family. A specific example of how I use the essential tool of laughter in my family is reconnecting with members that I haven't seen in a long time. Laughter is a great part of my relationship with my dad's whole family, and small family reunions as well as full family reunions don't exist without it. Since they are scattered across @ LOCATION2, and very few live near @ LOCATION1, visiting these family members is a rare opportunity. The most admirable quality of the fatherly side of the family is the innate sense of humor that everyone shares. Laughter just seems to be another form of communication for our family and is the main reason we get along so well. The relationships I share with individual family members can also be seen in each family assembly. Right at @ DATE1 my sister was pregnant with her first child and her baby shower was due at @ DATE2. This event contains a specific example where laughter was a predominant part of a relationship between myself and one of my family members. Not only did I have to be the only guy there, but I also had to be seated at a table with my aunt whom I hadn't seen for over a year. While we have always enjoyed each other's company in the past, I dreaded an embarrassing reunion and complete silence for the duration of the festivities. My sister's baby shower day inevitably came and to my surprise I was nervous. I helped set up the decorations and other equipment and found my seat. Within ten minutes, my aunt and table partner walked in and located her seat which was adjacent to mine. As nervous as I was, the very first thing my aunt did eased any tension that had built up in me and reminded me why I get along so well with my father's family. My aunt greeted me with a joke that I was the only guy who attended the shower. During the whole party, I only heard jokes from my aunt and the laughs shared between the two of us. We reconnected and bonded as family as well as good friends and the use of laughter was responsible for it all. Through the use of laughter my aunt and I reconnected and we had perhaps the most fun of all who attended. Whether we were making jokes about some of the party favors or just enjoying one of the ridiculous games, my aunt and I were laughing hysterically. that day and many others before and after, laughter was not only an element, but was the sole reason for my friendship with my aunt.
Laughter Laughter can change a lot of things in people, it can bring people together. Making the other person laugh can also help in relationships, which is always a good thing. @ CAPS2 your laughter with your friends can and always will be there, well i know it's with me and my friends. @ CAPS2 you are in a relationship or friendship, @ CAPS1 able to laugh with that other person is important as it can make you feel more connected to them, @ CAPS2 you have a large group of friends that you just met, you can all laugh together, it's even better because then you know you're getting somewhere. My best friend and I laugh all the time, @ CAPS3 can just look at me in a way I only understand and I'll know what @ CAPS3 means, then we both start laughing @ CAPS2 we're in a big group of people 'friends and we start to laugh, they all look at us funny. Then normally we tell them what they're laughing at, most of the time they don't understand. My best friend and I are always together, besides school we always laugh no matter if it's something that happened a day or a year ago. My best friend and I have a lot of jokes inside we only have to bring once to go out and if something funny happens we will start laughing about it again. In a relationship like having a "boyfriend" or a "girlfriend," one of the positives is making them happy, laughing, and loving being with you. My boyfriend does it to me, no matter if I'm not in a good mood, he always tries to make me smile, most of the time it works. @ CAPS2 you have a boyfriend or girlfriend that you always want to try to make them happy. This means that girls don't get over the stupid little things. Boys don't get mad @ CAPS2, they want to hang out with their friends. The best way to have a relationship with your boyfriend and your best friend is to make sure they don't hate each other, and if they do in a way that you can spend a day with your boyfriend and your boyfriend. best friend. The other. My relationship is working great, because my best friend is dating my boyfriend's best friend, so we can all hang out if we really want to and not fight, it's good to all have friends, this way we can go to the coast together and we can go out to dinner as a group. At the moment, we are thinking of planning a trip to the coast, and going there for a day was not entirely safe. I think the best way to have a good, laughing relationship is to do everything. Don't give your boyfriend or girlfriend your whole life because if you ever break up you won't have any friends anymore because they won't want to date you anymore because you left them for your boyfriend at the time. So I always try to tell my boyfriend without making it sound the wrong way. Normally guys understand that you have a life too and it doesn't revolve around them. My friend did it once and @ CAPS3 was not happy like everyone in the relationship, @ CAPS3 told me they never laughed together or anything, @ CAPS3 was afraid to break up him although @ CAPS3 wouldn't have friends, because @ CAPS3 made him his life. Laughter can always make you feel better, it's kind of like a healing process, it will always be there, it's just a matter of if someone can make you laugh. Their people who can make you laugh and @ CAPS4 and videos and family. @ CAPS2 you are with someone who makes you happy its like you are full of joy and pleasure to be with them and you care about them and feel comfortable around them . If you are having a hard time and you go through them and they still make you laugh and happy, you will know that they are the ones you are happy with and can laugh with. Family always makes you laugh whether you don't want to or not, I love my dad, he always knows how to make me laugh.
The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I was sitting in the living room with the @ CAPS3 family talking about how every @ ORGANIZATION1 always ends up laughing. A @ ORGANIZATION1 we were in the great-grandfathers house @ CAPS3, and we just finished opening our presents, and in the middle of the floor was a @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, cousin @ CAPS3 @ ORGANIZATION2 thought that @ CAPS3 dad was inside @ CAPS2. At first we tried to convince @ ORGANIZATION2 that @ CAPS3's dad was talking to @ CAPS3's uncle. @ ORGANIZATION2 didn't believe us, even though @ CAPS3's dad was talking. @ ORGANIZATION2 circled @ CAPS2, and observed @ CAPS2 and was convinced @ CAPS3's dad was in it. Then @ ORGANIZATION2 started pricking @ CAPS2. We were laughing because it was so cute that @ ORGANIZATION2 thought @ CAPS3's dad was in @ CAPS2. He kept saying "I know he's in there." @ ORGANIZATION2 opened @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3's father was not there. @ CAPS3 dad came into the house and asked why we were laughing. We told him the story and he started to laugh too. Later in @ TIME1 @ ORGANIZATION2 was playing in the other room and wanted to show @ CAPS3 daddy the toy he was playing with. So @ CAPS3 dad went up to @ CAPS2 and we told @ ORGANIZATION2 that @ CAPS3 dad was out. @ ORGANIZATION2 went out to look for it but @ CAPS3's dad wasn't there. When @ ORGANIZATION2 walked inside he looked around every room and couldn't find @ CAPS3's dad. After a while @ ORGANIZATION2 was standing next to @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3's dad jumped up and scared @ ORGANIZATION2. @ ORGANIZATION2 screamed like a little girl and we all laughed a lot. @ ORGANIZATION2 was crazy at first then he started to laugh too. At the time, @ ORGANIZATION2 was only five years old, so when @ CAPS3 daddy jumped on him he got really scared. @ ORGANIZATION2 thought it would be funny to scare @ CAPS3 daddy so @ ORGANIZATION2 hid in @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 dad came in and we told @ CAPS3 dad to look for @ ORGANIZATION2. @ CAPS3 dad called his name looked around every room and pretended he couldn't find @ ORGANIZATION2. @ ORGANIZATION2 started laughing because @ CAPS3's dad acted like he was going to sit on @ ORGANIZATION2 and it made him laugh really hard. When @ ORGANIZATION2 came out of @ CAPS2 he thought to himself "how did you know I was in @ CAPS2 ?" @ CAPS3 daddy said "Well you started laughing at the silly goose." out of all @ ORGANIZATION1 I had that @ ORGANIZATION1 was the best @ ORGANIZATION1 ever. It was the moment when laughter brought two people together.
While you're in the process of building relationships with anyone, you're usually going to start by making jokes and being silly. Whether you're trying to hook up with them, or just being the funniest one and making a great first impression. Usually all of these things make someone laugh; even if they really had no reason to. Anyone who is shy around new people will most likely laugh at anything they say. If it's someone you already know, you might always be laughing about something. There are different types of relationships you build with different people, and laughter is almost always the number one way to stay together. When you have been in a strong friendship with someone, you are already very close to each other. Laughter, crying, and fighting with that person will make the relationship stronger. There are times you spend with another person who will take steps towards solidarity. From my experiences, I will become a close friend of someone for a while; then we will argue and not be friends anymore. Although we fought and wished not to speak, we became good friends again because of all the time we spent laughing together. Being sad all the time, with no one else to laugh with, made us realize how much we miss each other. Although meeting someone new was easy; it didn't last as long as the friendship I had with the other person. Really, when you first meet someone, be it a boy or a girl, you are going to be laughing and making jokes almost all the time. This may even be how it will stay. Once you've known someone for so long, you can tell what kind of relationship you'll have with them. The bond you make with them is simple: you can get along, or you can always argue. Whatever relationship you have with an acquaintance, it will likely be the same all the time. When you're not that close to another person, you tend not to care about friendship as often. You won't be so emotional, although your experiences with them might still make you laugh. The time you spend with someone should always be full of fun and laughter. Another form of laughter could be spent with a boyfriend or girlfriend. in my opinion, you will make a special bond with your other half. When two people have chosen to be together, they choose to spend their time getting to know each other on a different level. The fun and laughter they will create can put them on a higher level of love than you would with a best friend. Couples should spend time together laughing and having fun. Making each other laugh will allow them to be closer in friendship; become comfortable with each other. they will gain confidence and skills just by sharing the time to laugh together. The laughter you laugh with with anyone, will build any kind of relationship. Usually the first impression will identify the connection you have with that person. There are always ways to deal with one person and not with the other. The three most common types of friendship are: acquaintances, boyfriend / girlfriend, and close friends. All the friends you make, the people you meet, will involve a lot of laughter.
What is laughter if not a smile, a little piece of happiness like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, an embarrassing situation, or anything. Laughter can be the thing that binds a friendship. I am going to tell @ CAPS5 a true story about laughter and how it got involved in my own relationship. It was my first day of high school, I walked into the school looking at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back and smile or if I should just stay for myself so I didn't say anything. I went to the office and asked them how to find acting lessons, they gave me a card that I didn't know how to read and sent me. At that time, I was scared. A tall @ CAPS1 guy with shaggy brown hair and a flannel jacket pushes me around and instead of a polite "I'm sorry" or even a polite "@ CAPS2 me" he looked at me disgusted and continued in. the hallway. It took a while, but I finally found my acting class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was a bit rounder and had short blonde hair. Her name was @ PERSON1 and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked as scared as I did. During the first @ NUM1 minutes of class, we looked at each other a few times, but didn't say anything. About halfway through class the girl next to me asked for my name, I answered "@ CAPS3" extremely softly. As I was about to turn away she caught my attention whispering to me, she giggled "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 see what she's wearing? What do teachers think of when they get dressed in the morning?" I started to laugh hysterically. The tall professor crouching in front of me said "@ CAPS5 two, hallway, now!" I wasn't sure if laughing was an option but as soon as I walked out of that door a smile crossed my face and I fell to the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think getting us in trouble was funny, but this bitter professor was such a bummer. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and sweet, at least I thought they were. The next class period, I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself sitting near the back, next to @ CAPS6. @ PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like it had been splashed with baby vomit, a pair of light blue skinny jeans that didn't flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink @ NUM2 inch high heels. Today she was in a good mood, @ CAPS5 could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When someone spoke, she burned her entire forehead with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot day in @ DATE1. We were all laughing behind his back, but that's how we got through his classroom alive. After a few minutes of chatting, she sent us at @ CAPS4 our first scene. The people in my group were @ CAPS6, my friend @ CAPS8 I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named @ ORGANIZATION1'montae. We all got to know each other pretty quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. @ ORGANIZATION1'montae was @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 as was @ CAPS8. @ ORGANIZATION1'montae was about @ NUM3 inches taller than me. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was incredibly pretty. @ CAPS8 was a calm type of person, @ CAPS4 alone. She was about @ NUM4 inches shorter than me and she had short black hair. It was direct, as I would quickly learn, always has been. She was stylish, she wore the cutest brown belt and matching shoes with skinny jeans and jacket @ CAPS12. Her whole outfit was adorable. We laughed the whole time, laughing at the teacher and telling jokes. We hardly worked. It was a day that I will never forget. To this day, I am still good friends with the three of them and we often talk about that day and how happy we were to have met. So, as @ CAPS5 can see, laughing is a big part of my relationships. It's a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when @ CAPS5 barely knows someone, @ CAPS5 can quickly discover that laughter leads to friendships. It's like being in your favorite place on earth for a moment. Laughing is a great way to connect with people around @ CAPS5. The next time you're out with your friends or with strangers, tell them a joke. Invaluable!
So many people sing songs and write stories about sad and depressing events as if it's the only thing life is all about. We never seem to stop and focus on the little things. If we could stop and enjoy these little things everyone would realize how great they really are. One way or another we are all looking for pity and for some reason we want to have the worst story. As if it was some kind of competition. Personally, I don't want to have the worst story. If you "deal with" things seem lighter, more carefree, and people would rather be surrounded by someone who makes them feel good and happy rather than someone who makes them sad. There are many times I could have chosen to stay angry and upset, but instead I chose to just laugh and not make a big deal out of a small mistake. For example, @ DATE1 was the dance @ CAPS1. I had to be there early to finish decorating, but I was late (as always). It didn't really matter that I was late because when I got there I found out it was canceled. By the time they decided to cancel it (due to a power outage) my parents had already left by car and they did not have their cell phones with them. I was stuck at school. As I was trying to reach someone to pick me up, two of my friends showed up, even though I told them the prom was canceled. My friend's mother was kind enough to pick us up. We met the rest of our friends downtown, where we decided to go to @ LOCATION1 and play some arcade games. We had a wonderful time! We all have matching rings and I have two lollipops. When we were done, we went to our friends' house, where we watched movies and ate popcorn. I had eaten way too much sugar and I was super hyper! I kept saying a ton of random things, but it made for a great night full of laughs. Could have been really upset that the dance was canceled, we all could have but we made the most of what we had and ended up having a great time. And I personally think it was more fun than the dancing would have been. Another example is when I was in first grade. There was a day that seemed particularly hard to me. I felt like no one wanted to be my friend or hang out with me. I remember sitting alone in the hallway, feeling like no one cared. That year, an elderly person came to me and started talking to me. I remember him telling me it was harder to frown than to smile. I realized he was absolutely right. Even though smiling requires more muscle, long-term frowning has a worse effect. If I could go back to that day, I wouldn't be such a drama queen. I was making a big deal out of something that wasn't even true. I always say things that I later regret, but if I “do with it” it doesn't seem so bad. If I could, I would write a dozen songs that don't have sad or depressing meaning. Or millions of books based on the happiest things in life. If you fall, it's better to laugh than to run away crying. What won't kill you will make you stronger. Lots of things make you stronger, like: breakups, heartache, class @ CAPS2.E and of course laughter. Laughter also makes you live longer; So why don't you laugh as much as possible ?
Many have heard that laughing makes you live longer. I don't know if this is true but I can believe it. When I laugh I feel lighter, my stress load gets lighter, @ PERSON1 I am able to see the world with different eyes. This change in me is sometimes more evident than others, as if before the miracle of laughter I felt overworked, exhausted or sad. It is my belief that having people to make you laugh is essential to living a fulfilling life, @ PERSON1 I am grateful that my days are filled with good friends @ PERSON1 with funny memories. Humor is one of the things that must be present in any relationship; you must be able to make yourself laugh. I have had several times with my two best friends, @ PERSON1, when we just couldn't stop laughing. I deeply cherish all the time we spend alone together because I know that I will leave happy, with a smile on my face, with a lot of great stories to tell. One of those occasions was @ PERSON1's birthday party on the penultimate @ DATE1. @ PERSON1 wanted a small party with only the people closest to her, so @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 I was the only guest. We live in a cute little town, however, there isn't much going on in the party business. Because of this everyone ends up going to @ CAPS1, only half an hour away. It was a blazing day @ DATE1 @ PERSON1 we wanted to show off our tans so of course @ PERSON1 started their party with a float on the meandering river @ CAPS2. That's when the laughs started. Three twelve year old girls walking down a river on their own with a giant beach ball (birthday present in advance) that was quickly dubbed @ CAPS3, what could be so funny ? One of the things that makes our friendship so important to preserve is the way we find humor in every situation when we're together. They thought it was hilarious that I had an irrational fear of algae (or river grass, or pond grass, or any kind of aquatic grass for that matter) @ PERSON1 that I would scream or scream out loud whenever some touched me. I thought it was fantastic that @ PERSON1 just couldn't hold onto their sandals, @ PERSON1 would end up doing wild dives for them as they were flying away. We both thought the way @ PERSON1, the @ CAPS4 that she is, hesitates to get wet was absurd. @ PERSON1, of course, we pushed her a few times. These are the things that make our relationship so special. We can be serious for each other when needed, @ PERSON1 no one will disrespect my friends @ PERSON1 to get by, but when we are together I can let my guard down @ PERSON1 can be myself. My goofy, irrational, and seemingly hilarious self, @ PERSON1 is still having fun. Our laughter can even change the way a situation goes. For example, after finishing on the river, @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 I went to @ ORGANIZATION1 for an afternoon of music @ PERSON1 food. We all have huge ice cream cones, the best money you can buy. My friends had already finished theirs, @ PERSON1 was playing with @ CAPS3 a few feet away. I was about to take another divine lick from my waffle cone when the @ CAPS3 the ball flies over @ PERSON1 pops all the ice cream out of my cone ! I had a completely intact cone left, but all the good things were on the ground. Needless to say, I was devastated. Who knows what would have happened if @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 hadn't started laughing. I might have cried or sulked for an hour or two. However, my face was so comical, staring in disbelief at the empty cone, that they couldn't help but laugh. They fell on the grass, in hysteria. Even despite my disappointment, I also started to crack up, @ PERSON1 so everything looked fine. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people, or three in my case. My two best friends make me laugh like no other person I have ever met, @ PERSON1 I suspect I will never meet someone else who makes me feel like them. This laughter that we have made us feel better. It helps us relax. @ PERSON1 lets our guard down, so the times after laughing together are often the times when we confide in each other the most. If either of us is feeling down or in the weather, laughing is the sure-fire way to get them back on their feet @ smiling PERSON1. Just being with them makes me more exuberant, lets me let go of my troubles. This is why laughter is so important to the three of us. Every time we laugh, our relationship is built. It's the good times we have been through that help us get through the bad times, @ PERSON1 I know our good times wouldn't have been so good without the way we can laugh together.
The @ CAPS1 of laughter Many people think that it is love that brings people together. But love is something that grows over time and brings people together for the long haul. Before you loved someone, you laughed with them. Laughter creates conversation, mends relationships, and brings joy to people. It's an important part of any relationship and has definitely helped me make friends. In kindergarten everything was new to me. I have to leave my house, go to school, have lunch and go to recess. There were a lot of kids like me, leaping with excitement as our daily routine began. Although we played together at school, at home there was no one to play with. One day after school, I noticed a boy walking by my yard. I walked over and remembered him from that school day in my class. "@ CAPS2" was all I said. He turned around and burped as hard as he could with all his might. We burst out laughing and I knew I made a new friend that day. From then on he and I were best friends. Any adventure that happened after school always ended with a laugh at something. Our parents did not need to set up "play dates" or schedules to meet other children, as it was easier to laugh at something and make friends naturally, not awkwardly for a while. that parents were discussing. From then on, making new friends was a snap. During elementary school and until my teenage years, I had a best friend and many more friends, just because of a laugh. Laughter is something that can always “break the ice”. Whenever you meet someone new, it's always a little hard to just talk to them. You don't know if you need to be serious, outgoing, funny, or calm. But if something happens that makes you both laugh, then it becomes easier to communicate because that laughter eases some of the tension between the two of you. It's like riding a bike, after the initial awkwardness things get easier and easier. For many, laughter helps heal pain. Tragic things happen in the life of every person and it can be difficult to deal with them at times. Whether it's a breakup, a depressed mood, or maybe even the death of a loved one, something fun and a laugh @ MONTH1 helps them forget what is bothering them. Most of the time, it's all a person wants, something to help them forget what's bothering them, if only for a few minutes. This is how people build better relationships, they do everything they can for each other to make themselves feel better. Besides its healing and conversation starting qualities, laughing is just plain fun to do. It @ MONTH1 starts out as a chuckle, turns into a chuckle, and ends with a fifteen minute session of giggles and side cramps. And most of the time, you are with friends to have fun and happiness with you. If you've never laughed once in your life, there's something wrong. It will eliminate awkward moments, ease painful thoughts or feelings, and create instant pleasure. Try it, it's not that hard. I guarantee it will bring you closer to someone, make life less stressful, and make you happy.
When I was younger, my sister and I argued all the time. It would be either verbally or physically. Whatever we were arguing, we would drag on for hours. Not only did we get more and more upset over time, my mom and my family were fed up. It didn't help that it had only been @ NUM1 months between us. It would make everything ten times more tense. My mom had a few tactics to try and get us arrested. One would ground us. But we were sharing a room, which would only make matters worse. Another gave us chores that were both time consuming and boring, the last one made us sit across applesauce, face each other and hold hands. We hated this one. But every time we did, we ended up breaking down and forgetting what we were fighting for. After we did that, we hugged and moved on. Laughter brought us closer together and always helped make things right.
Life is so uncertain, unfair and ruthless, but one simple thing can change this view of the cruelty of the world; to laugh. In your deepest worry in your darkest thoughts, laughter can bring sunshine. Laughter is a remedy for the sick, a pill for the wounded, and a comfort for the old. We don't even think about laughing, when in return it gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a flashlight for the lost and a lifeline for the desperate. Laughter is truly the cure for all mankind. Explaining laughter is like explaining why we breathe, we just do it, it's part of life. It's natural for people to laugh, it might not always be appropriate, but it's something we come back to when needed. Laughter creates dreams, hopes and puts an end to thoughts of uncertainty. Laughter is a friend, helper, and icebreaker to many, leaving joy and hope to everyone he meets. It is part of life that we have to cherish every moment that we can. Several times, laughter has helped me, but once stands out more than the rest. A moment, a simple moment when laughter changed me, my opinions and life itself; put my life in motion. With slumped shoulders, I listened to my six-period teacher as she buzzed over nothing important. I turned around hoping to find something to distract me. When I turned around, I met the eyes of a man I had never spoken to, he looked at me curiously while waiting for my explanation. I wanted, no, I needed to talk to him so I gave it a shot. "@ CAPS1 did you watch the wrestling?" he smiled and laughed. Without it, the @ CAPS1 conversation would have been totally different. He could @ CAPS1 ignore me, but he laughed and it changed the course of my life. Soon after that this man became my boyfriend, because we spoke after I asked him this. This laughter made everything so simple, it knocked the puzzle into place. Moments @ CAPS1 occur when laughter has dug a pit of ruins for me. Even though laughing is such a wonderful thing, you still have to be careful about when is a good time to laugh and when it's not. Again, a moment that stuck with me was a time when I was young. I played on my own most of the time picking up a Barbie, brushing her hair, "@ CAPS2 come here." I heard my father call. I went into the living room where my brother already resides and waited with my Barbie. My dad kneels down to talk, "@ CAPS3 is going to be leaving soon because she needs time. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay. I want you to stay with her and I I'll see you when I can. I love you @ CAPS2 always remember this. " I burst out laughing, didn't realize or even understand what was really going on. I laughed as I got into the car, the moment we left I realized how serious this problem was. Maybe I didn't hurt anyone laughing, but it pained me not to take him so seriously. Life is never known, we never know where life will take us, take us, kick us or let us down. Laughter is an emotion and can heal wounds, but it is also a power that should not be mistreated or abused. Giving us joy and pleasure, He helps us get up when we fall and rejoices us. Laughter is a way of life and the savior of humanity.
To laugh? What is laughter? Well, laughter is a contagious disease that is spread by a group of people from one to another, (@ CAPS1 speaking) and should be included in every person's life as they grow older. Here is a true story of how laughter played a key role in my childhood life. My @ CAPS5 has five laughing days as I call them, which we all celebrate throughout the year : birthdays, @ LOCATION2, @ DATE1 from @ DATE1, @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3. On my birthday, everyone @ CAPS5 meets at my grandparents' house to celebrate the day I was born. Usually, a few days before my birthday, my mom grants me the power to invite some of my friends to come see an event or go to the arcade. Then when we get home we all stay up late playing video games and watching movies. When @ LOCATION2 finally decides to welcome us with its colored eggs and candies, my @ CAPS5 meets at my uncle's to hide the eggs that we children have to find. What we always seem to miss is at least one every year. While we find the eggs, our parents take them and hide them again. When we first noticed it was when my uncle was climbing on the willow tree in the back yard and replacing the eggs where we found them. Then watch him try to come down. When it's all over, we play a game of hide and seek. Which is pretty hard to win when there are fourteen people hiding on an acre lot. On @ DATE1, everyone has their own agenda that they set aside. My dad and I are going to @ LOCATION1, @ ORGANIZATION1 to turn on @ CAPS6 the third of @ DATE1 for @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6. While waiting for the show to start, we play a game of laser tag which ends up being a big game of about fifty people. Then on @ DATE1 my dad does his own backyard show for us kids which is really exhilarating to watch. Next is my favorite laughing day @ CAPS2. My father sets up his house as a haunted house. Which is funny since we're all painted and shot with silly string thrown at us from unseen sources. When we go for a ride or treatment I'm usually a soldier with an unloaded, fully camouflaged @ CAPS8 pistol, which makes for an interesting night when they can't find me even though I'm right next to them. Later when we get home it's a competition to see who has the most candy, I usually win because I can stay out later than my siblings. Well, now it's time for the vacation that ends all other @ CAPS3 vacations ! a time of gift and reception. mainly receiving for me. We all have a dish that we cook and we end up with some of that dish on me or anyone who dares to enter the kitchen when I'm cooking. After everyone has finished eating, we sit down and start opening the gifts from the youngest to the oldest. Then it's a free for all for your own gifts until the adults but in and get us tidied up. It's funny to see them chasing my cousin around the house because he took a present from them. So this is my story of what a year of laughter is for me in a nutshell. This is why laughter should be in everyone's life as they grow older. It relaxes and builds relationships at the same time. Like a saying, my grandparents would tell us kids when we were sad "One laugh a day will keep @ CAPS10 at @ LOCATION1".
A Funny Story Many summers ago @ CAPS1's best friend @ PERSON1 and I had a sleepover at @ CAPS1's house. We were both excited because @ CAPS1's dad would be the only one there. @ CAPS1 mom and brother were out late. After eating popcorn and stuffing ourselves with candy, we decided to try something new and fun. The @ CAPS1 house has a counter where four to five people can sit and so @ CAPS1 dad decided to put on some hip hop music. As if @ PERSON1 and I could read each other's minds, we hopped onto the counter and started doing the runway model walk. We worked it like no other. It was funny to see @ CAPS1's daddy pretending to be the fake photographer and saying it's "gorgeous" like he was a real photographer. @ PERSON1 and I strutted up and down and made stops and poses and turns, until we were too dizzy. We all knew we could never do that with @ CAPS1 mom @ ORGANIZATION1 which made everything so funny! We all burst out laughing until we couldn't breathe! Later, after this fun model runway, we decided to ride some cushions on the stairs. I was a little scared at first but after seeing the look on @ PERSON1's face, I knew I had to. I grabbed a big pillow and hurtled down those stairs like a champ ! It was so awesome! @ PERSON1 and I have kept the @ CAPS2 pillow on for what seems like forever ! @ CAPS1 daddy put @ ORGANIZATION1 and we laughed the night away. That night was one of the best memories and @ ORGANIZATION1 from @ CAPS1's childhood.
In my opinion, I think laughter is a very important part of life. What would the world be without laughter and jokes? It would be a very boring and boring place. I can't even imagine what it would be. The world needs to laugh about it. People need to make jokes and they need laughter and comedy in their life. I myself have a lot of laughs in my life. One day in fifth grade, my best friend and I were jogging the track for a gym class. We were running together, talking and telling each other jokes to pass the time because it was so boring. I told this really awesome joke, can't remember what it was, and he started laughing so hard. We both laughed together to the point of crying. He fell on the track and rolled over the grass. I said "@ CAPS1 we have to continue or the gym teacher will get angry". He said, "I can't, I just peed in my pants !" It made me laugh even more. He stood up and walked over to the gym teacher. The gym teacher told my friend to go to the nurse's office. After gym class ended I found him with him in the classroom and he told me he called his mom and she brought him a new pair of underwear and pants. . I wonder what his mother must have thought. It was a funny day. Since then, we have always talked about this day together. I still laughed at him for peeing in his pants, but I told him a funny joke. Our whole relationship was all about making each other laugh and telling jokes. Just around the two of us, being silly together was what we did. The jokes and laughter made our friendship so much better and gave me amazing memories that I could possibly have for the rest of my life. At the same time, if you don't have jokes and laughs in your friendship, it can make your relationship very boring and lame. If you don't have a lot of or no laughs in your friendship then you aren't having fun with that person and you don't want to hang out with them because it's just boring. I have this other friend named @ CAPS2, I go to his house sometimes and we hang out and play video games together. What is strange is that we barely communicate with each other. We just do stuff and we don't have fun with it. There are no jokes or laughs or anything great like that. We just play their video games in silence without saying a word to the other person. It is the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. It's the most boring friendship two people can have. It's really boring there because we do the same thing over and over again. I don't really like going there. I would rather be in another friend's house for fun, but I'm going anyway and don't know why. Without jokes and laughs in a friendship, it makes things boring and not fun. This is something you absolutely must have. Laughter is not only an important element in a friendship, it is also an important element to have in a romantic relationship. If you are dating someone, you absolutely have to laugh in your relationship. If you look around you always see couples making jokes together and laughing with each other all the time, having fun. It makes their relationship interesting and enjoyable. Think about it, who wants to date a boring person who doesn't like to laugh and make jokes? Nobody wants. So, in a romantic relationship, you especially need laughter and comedy more than in a friendship. You want things to go well so that the other person likes you and thinks you are funny. It's one of the key things that brings a couple together. So, as you can see from my three examples, laughter really makes a big difference in relationships and just in life in general. If you have the laughter in a friendship it can really have a really great impact on the relationship. It makes for an interesting and fun relationship. Laughter makes people happy and gets along well with each other. If you're feeling down, laughing can always cheer you up and make you feel better. It's almost like a drug. If you don't have a laugh, it can really make things rotten and make the relationship boring. Nobody wants that. People don't want a boring, lifeless relationship with someone. Laughter is something that brings people together in a good way. It brings all of my friends together and makes us best friends. We have a great time and really have fun. Laughter is a great thing that everyone should have in their life.
Laughing at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 on the first day of school last year, I walked through the school doors hoping to make a friend or two. I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but hoped for the best. I walked into my first class and sat down at a table with all the faces unfamiliar. I wanted to say something but I was afraid of their reactions. The teacher made us play a few games where we had to introduce ourselves. These didn't really help. Everyone was tense and everything was awkward. I @ CAPS3 already wanted to be myself and make friends. For the rest of the day, all of my classes were like this. Everyone was tense and awkward, as if something was keeping us silent. Not knowing anyone did not help the situation a little. It was the first day for me. On the second day, I walked through the doors of the school, determined to make friends. I thought about the jokes I could say, the interesting thing about myself that I could share, but to me it all sounded like silly ideas. I go into the humanities and sat down at a table with a friendly looking girl. The teacher told us to introduce ourselves to the other students at the table where we were sitting. For about a minute it was very quiet, but I wanted to introduce myself so badly. I couldn't stand this silence any longer. I looked in the backpack for a pencil and I see a note from my mom saying "@ CAPS4 be yourself and make friends honey, have a nice day at school. :)". I started laughing because I thought it was funny my mom wrote me a note and stuck it in my backpack. It was so unexpected and I felt like a child. I started to laugh and when I looked up I saw that the girl next to me was laughing too. I knew I had to say something, so I did. I said: "@ CAPS5 my names @ PERSON1, but you can call me @ CAPS4 abbreviated. What's your name ?". The girl looked at me, smiled and said, "@ CAPS5, my names @ CAPS8". Then I asked her which college she was from and other questions. We started talking, exchanged numbers and became good friends. Laughter at @ CAPS1, who would have known? A year has passed and we are still friends. We are still laughing at the way we started to talk. A few days ago I told her how I felt @ CAPS2 this second day of school. I told him I was afraid to introduce myself. She said she felt the same and didn't know what to do either. Since then, I thank my mom for writing this note because without her I wouldn't have laughed and made @ CAPS8 laugh and I wouldn't have made such a good friend.
It's day one of high school and your guts are full of butterflies that make you want to run to the bathroom and hide from the world. I still had friends @ CAPS7 and was too shy to join any of the groups so I made all of my classes on my own. The students would put themselves in front of me, wanting to know which school I was from and wanted to know everything about me. I remember wanting to stay alone, hidden in my own bubble space. Girls were asking @ CAPS5 I was upset because I wasn't smiling or having fun knowing my new classes. Lunch was much more crowded than my old school. Students would sit in the hallways for their lunch or crowd around a large table, chatting loudly to each other. I bit my lip looking for somewhere that wasn't occupied by students. I found a table near the front of the dining room which was empty and placed my brown lunch bag in front of me eating my peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Two boys and two girls rushed over and took a seat next to me, making fun of each other for not having a place next to me. "@ CAPS1 I'm @ PERSON3, what's your name ? " was a skinny boy in a black hats answer to me. "@ PERSON1" was all I replied to anyone who looked at me all the time. "That's a cute name, I'm @ LOCATION1, it's @ LOCATION2, you just met @ PERSON3, and @ PERSON4 is the funny kid next to you with his orange backpack," I told them. smiled and motioned to them that @ ORGANIZATION2 was wearing a @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 t-shirt and @ PERSON2 was wearing a military uniform that said @ CAPS4. They all had lunch at school and had pizza or sub sandwiches. They showed photos of funny events on their phones to everyone, even me. "@ CAPS5, this kid is not paying attention, he might have a rash." I said, laughing a little, looking at the photo of a little boy sliding down a slide that looked like a cheese grader. @ PERSON3 took off all of his pepperoni and tossed them randomly in the air. @ PERSON2 was going to take a picture of everyone for photo ID on their phone. @ PERSON4 was next for his photo to be taken when the pepperoni in @ LOCATION3's hands slipped and landed on @ ORGANIZATION1's face. I burst out laughing and everyone at the table joined in. @ PERSON3 and I hug our stomachs and wipe away our tears. @ PERSON4 went to the bathroom to wash the smell off his face and when he came back @ PERSON2 said: "@ CAPS6 my word you should see your face I took your picture right after the pepperoni hit you in the face and your picture is just hilarious, your mouth is wide open like you're about to eat something and like you're angry. " @ PERSON2 handed their phone to one person at a time and we all started laughing again as we asked @ PERSON2 to send the photo to each of them. I asked, looking them all in the eye. @ ORGANIZATION2 was the only one to respond, "@ CAPS7 you can't be our friend, @ PERSON1 duh @ CAPS5 we didn't want to be your friend so we wouldn't be with you." @ ORGANIZATION2 teased. My twisted gut loosened with a new leaf. “@ CAPS8, we probably would have found an excuse to leave,” @ PERSON3 smiled. I laughed at myself because I was worried about not fitting in or having friends who might make me laugh as hard as when pepperoni stuck to @ LOCATION4's face.
Laughter can sometimes be something that everyone shares, sometimes it is only used by a few because it is directed at each other. But I hope most of the time it's something we can all share. Laughter opens a relationship where people can feel more comfortable with each other. Someone can be a complete stranger to each other, then just by a simple joke, the laughter could make them feel like they've been friends for years. Now, laughing is not the only thing that helps people get to know each other, they may share hobbies or similar likes and dislikes, but most of the time, laughter is something that everyone needs. in a relationship. I remember when I first met my friend @ PERSON1 he wasn't too outgoing, but by making jokes he seemed more comfortable talking with others. He and I would often talk about @ CAPS1 our everyday life where there was too much to deal with but instead of making jokes about it we decided to laugh at @ CAPS1 we would complain when our lives were easy compared to others. Some people have to work @ NUM1 jobs to support a family and we are here to complain about @ CAPS1 we have to wake up and go to school we laughed at @ CAPS1 pathetic as we looked. A few days later, we found ourselves thinking about what we wanted to do when we were older and after high school. @ PERSON1 said he wanted to be a taekwando instructor and already had a little job at an hour, I said "@ CAPS1 did you get the job?" He replied "I gave a kick a kid pretty hard in the face when my instructor was watching ". We both laughed very loudly, and just through that laughter we became even more friends, because it is through laughter that we can become civilized.
Laughter @ CAPS1 is one of the most important things in life. People shouldn't go a day without @ CAPS1. It's healthy and good in any relationship. It can also aid in healing. The best type of laughter is when you are out of breath and cry. It makes people so happy and wanting more. Don't take life too seriously, laugh and smile all the time. Someone who dies is a terrible thing. When two high school kids die, it's even worse. A @ DATE1 @ TIME1, a group of high school kids were walking on the rocks by the ocean, when a wave of sneakers tore two of them off. The other children tried so hard to save them by making a rope of clothes to reach them, but it didn't work. Two beautiful lives were taken that day and will not be forgotten. The boys were very popular and had great lives. The families of the students, the school, friends and the community were in shock and could not believe the terrible news. How could this have happened to such amazing people. Hundreds of students gathered at church on the following @ DATE2, most of them in tears. They talked about the two boys and had a huge group prayer. Friends spoke well of them, they missed them a lot, talking about the good, funny and memorable times. @ CAPS1 can improve it. Like someone once said, smile because they have lived, don't cry because they are gone. At the school basketball game, they paid tribute to the boys and won the game for them. Parents and friends talked about the beautiful children in front of almost @ NUM1 people who came to support the school. The game was a time for having a good time, not for sobbing and moping. This game helped heal the community a bit more. @ CAPS1 and cheering can really help the heart. As the days, weeks and months go by, people will always be heartbroken. Although, as long as we laugh and smile at the good times of those who are gone, we can overcome anything. @ CAPS1 makes you feel better. It just shows you that you need to make the most of what you have and that you always have fun with no regrets. Always tell the people who matter to you that you love them. Never stop telling people you love them and never go into battle. You don't know when it might be the last time you see them. @ CAPS1 is so important, and without it life wouldn't be as good as it is.
People can share a lot. DNA, clothes, feelings, beliefs, religion and laughter. For my sister @ PERSON3 and I, laughter is what made our relationship stronger than ever. When I was younger it was the typical vibe of an older sister @ LOCATION1, frankly we didn't like each other at all. As we matured, entered high school, and been part of the same organization that runs the cheers, we spent almost too much time together and now it's almost like we're best friends. At @ DATE3, we were constantly together. We would watch Jerry @ PERSON1, laugh and / or make fun of the people who volunteered to be on the show. We were watching clips from the Saturday show @ TIME1 @ CAPS1, that's where I introduced him to the character "@ CAPS2". @ PERSON3 and I were talking about the voice we adapted from "@ CAPS2" and constantly laughing at @ NUM1 @ TIME1 @ CAPS1 is also where we adapted the "demonic voice". We were talking to each other, and our friends in those voices. We always talk like this @ DATE1. When we entered high school, we had to start driving together every day to and from school. We would listen to music, make up random dance moves and sometimes I would have to direct if her favorite song was playing (she was a very energetic dancer). It was while having fun. When we entered school, however, everything changed and I figured that out after about a week. I was the annoying younger sister who couldn't say hello to her in the hallway or wave at her when she was with her friends. She wanted to be left alone so as not to look weird. She was a junior at the time, they still think they're the coolest around. Once she was a senior she would say hello to me, she would smile when she saw me, I would even talk to her and her friends sometimes. We also got closer once I entered the student leadership class she was also a part of, we had the same class every other day, it was hard not to talk to each other. The only thing I think brought our relationship closer because of the laughter was the three weeks she was in my room. She decided to "move in" when she woke up in the morning with insect bites on her arms and legs and she would have no idea where they came from. We suspected that she just didn't remember receiving them when she had dated @ TIME1 before, but when she didn't want to go out she still had them. We figured out what it was like when her friend @ PERSON2 came by; she had bedbugs. That @ TIME1 I separated the two mattresses I sleep on and made her a bed thinking she would only be there for two three night highs so my parents had time to sanitize her room. It turned into two to three weeks. We spent almost every hour of every day together for those three weeks, the only peace I had was in the shower. We would stay up late talking about our day, who we didn't like, what outfit we really liked that day, what we wanted to do in training, and who could have done better to cheer on. . If you knew @ PERSON3 you would know how scared she is of a movie, so half the time when we got up late I was next to her trying to scare her. It's quite funny to see his reaction. Eventually she "moved" and I got my room back although I don't think even now it's the same as before. They say a lot about laughter; "Laughter is the best medicine" "Laughter is the shortest distance between people" "@ CAPS5 two people in a room, they will be laughing in @ NUM2 minutes" ; This is all about how relationships develop with laughter. I have the funniest, silliest, tallest sister in the world because you can laugh at the same things. We have the same mind, people say, we do a lot of the same things, we think a lot the same way, and we also wear a lot of the same things. I am positive, laughter has strengthened my sister and me relationship. I bet if you really look at the relationship between you and someone you're close to, the first memory you think of is a happy moment of laughter.
One day, I was going to my friend's house @ ORGANIZATION1 @ PERSON1 for her birthday party @ NUM1. I knew the birthday party was going to be a lot of fun even if it was just @ ORGANIZATION1, @ CAPS1 and me. I had no idea it was going to be as much fun as it turned out to be. All day long, I waited for it to be @ NUM2 so I could go to her place. I packed all my bags and got everything ready because it was a slumber party. As I was on her way to her, she called me and said "before you get home, look to the right". The whole way my dad and I drove to his house, kept my eyes on the right side of the road, not sure what to look for. As we approached, I saw something in the bushes. It was @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ PERSON2. I told my dad to honk them so they know I was there and as he did they both pulled down their pants and blew us away! I laughed so hard all night long that I couldn't stop thinking about my father's expression ! I had no idea it wasn't going to be the funniest thing that happened that night. Later, @ ORGANIZATION1, @ PERSON2 and I went for a walk to the dock near @ LOCATION1's house. While we were on the dock a bat walked by and @ PERSON2 almost fell into the water because she was so scared. @ ORGANIZATION1 and I were standing behind her laughing so hard ! By this time it was a little dark and his neighbors were very noisy. So we ran from the dock to his neighbors' house and hid and started shouting things at them to shut up ! It was so funny because they had no idea where the screams were coming from so they just kept looking around confused. We started to laugh so hard we could barely shut up. We had to wait a while for his neighbors to stop looking around to try to figure out who was telling them to shut up. It's not the funniest thing that has happened either! As we were walking back to @ LOCATION1's house, we heard a car coming up so we made a plan. I stood in the middle of the street and @ ORGANIZATION1 stood in front of me while @ PERSON2 hid in the bushes. The plan was @ ORGANIZATION1 and I was going to pretend to fight and @ PERSON2 was going to come out of the bushes and pretend to shoot me. So the car starts to turn the corner and me and @ ORGANIZATION1 start fake fights. As the car gets closer it starts to slow down and here is @ PERSON2 coming out of the bushes and @ CAPS2 ! Pretend to shoot me. I fall to the ground like I'm really hurt trying to hold back my laughs, and man, did we think the people in the car were good. Then we realize there is no way she shot me when there was no sound of gunfire ! So the people in the car come over and they laugh so hard we can hear them before we even see who it is. When they got closer we realized there were only a few family friends from @ ORGANIZATION1 coming in for the party so they knew it was wrong all the time. When it got darker outside we found a huge watermelon and took it to a bridge near the house @ LOCATION1. We brought his video camera and put it on night vision and threw the watermelon off the bridge. When it hit the water it made a really loud sound and split into a bunch of little pieces! That night was one of the best and funniest I have ever had. The next day all the fun continued by going to the lake and swinging on ropes in the water. @ ORGANIZATION1 had a really bad rope burn and it was hilarious ! @ PERSON2, @ ORGANIZATION1 and I always have the best time together and tons of laughs. Much more happened that night, overall it was a great @ NUM1 birthday for @ ORGANIZATION1. I'm glad I was there with her for that.
We've all had times when something happened and you just saw it as a nuisance. But looking back on the same event you only have to laugh how silly it was. I remember one of those experiences when I went on a motorcycle camping trip this @ DATE1. It was a bright, sunny day when my dad dropped me off at the start of the main forest road in the area. I decided to keep my pace slow and steady and just enjoy the beautiful scenery. Later that day I found a scenic spot to camp for a few nights on the river. In @ TIME1, I remembered some forks from the main road when I drove with my brother through these woods and decided to go explore some near my camp. I decided to go and find one across the river which looked like a fun ride. As I was driving through it, my front tire hit rocks that knocked me over the edge! Luckily I fell off my motorbike, if I hadn't it could very well have fallen on top of me which, alone in the woods, would have put me in a tough spot. After taking my @ ORGANIZATION1 out of the water, I returned to camp to dry my clothes, as I only brought one set with me. While reading a book and waiting for my clothes to dry, I fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up I realized that the sun had been up for a while now, so I decided that I had better get out before the day was over. This time I stayed on my water side and walked up a steep road that led to the top of the ridge. As I went up it got hotter and hotter then I walked through the woods and witnessed a great view. The sun was just reaching the ridge in front of me and I had to stop and bask in the sun. After a while of sitting still, I started again. The road I was on started to narrow into a valley. Basically, the floodwaters had washed a large amount of silt off the road and it was still muddy. As I walked through it, my wheels started to spin and throw mud at me, which made me very dirty. Once again, I returned to the camp to wash my clothes in the river. This time I didn't fall asleep for a while and when I did it was in great shape. Upon awakening, I packed my meager provisions and headed for the end of my trip. Most of the day only got me halfway to my destination, so I was forced to stop and rest for the night. Just setting up my tent and taking food out for dinner and breakfast in @ TIME1 didn't take me very long. With little to occupy my time, I sat by my fire and reflected on my trip and life in general. When I fell asleep I slept soundly until @ TIME1. Waking up to the sound of birdsong and the rushing river beside me was delicious and invigorating. It only took me a few hours to reach where my dad was going to meet me and bring me home. This trip has helped me reflect and collect my thoughts. It also helped me appreciate the little things in life that we so often take for granted. Looking back at it always makes me laugh and realize that my mistakes could have been a lot worse, but they turned out to be only minor setbacks. All in all, it was a great time to collect my thoughts and renew my soul.
Laughter is a natural reaction that all human beings have when they are happy or have heard or seen something funny for them. It is healthy to be happy other than sad or crazy. Laughter is pretty much a sign of happiness, just like crying is a sign of sadness. It's just another natural emotion that everyone is born with. I agree with the quote someone once said about laughter being the closest distance between two people because, if two people get along, they will have many times in their life together where they will be. happy. It's easy to get along with people who have a good sense of humor because they don't take everything personally and can understand a joke. It's always good to have a good sense of humor because it's something everyone enjoys, too, that way people can see that you like to have fun when you know you don't. need to be serious. When you're with a group of friends who you get along with really well, one of the main things you'll hear is laughter. It shows that you are getting along and having fun. Of course, there are times when it's best not to laugh, or when people laugh for no reason, which often becomes annoying. Yes, laughing means you're happy, but when it's not needed and is only being used to make noise, it's better to be quiet than to annoy everyone around you. In my group of friends we always laugh and joke with each other, I like when people have a good sense of humor, I feel more relaxed and it's easier to talk to them. Unless, that is, they take everything for a joke and never take anything seriously. Even though it's natural, you need to know when you can and can't laugh. It's one way to show happiness, but in some situations it can be disrespectful or rude. Sometimes when I'm with my friends they @ MOIS1 joke about a certain person, and once it happened like that; at my friends birthday party we all went bowling and as always we were all standing talking and having a great time. While we were talking, @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON4 were joking about something, so we all started listening to their conversation. They were joking about something, then @ PERSON3 said something to somehow reject it, ask for a joke, and @ PERSON4 said he was going to be heartbroken. Right after that was said, @ ORGANIZATION1 stepped in, adding again. So it turned out that @ PERSON4 was going to be heartbroken again. While everyone was laughing about it, @ PERSON4 looked at @ ORGANIZATION1 with a hurt expression and was the only one not laughing. See, @ PERSON4 had a girlfriend who broke up with him about two months ago, @ ORGANIZATION1 forgot that and didn't want to say anything when she added "again". She thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be really nasty. In this case, the laughter provoked by @ ORGANIZATION1 was intended for @ PERSON4, who was hurt by @ ORGANIZATION1's comment. Luckily @ ORGANIZATION1 noticed and remembered @ PERSON4's ex later today. She ended up apologizing for saying something that she should have thought more carefully before she said. The way a person takes it when people laugh at them has a lot to do with friendship. Once my friends were driving to a car party or coming home from a party and listening to music in the car, one of the guys in the car was singing his voice to a song by @ PERSON1. At one point, while he was singing, his best friend suddenly turned the volume down so everyone in the car heard @ PERSON2 singing loudly, no music. Everyone started laughing because @ PERSON2 didn't know that @ CAPS1 would turn off the music in the middle of something. Although it was a little embarrassing, @ PERSON2 laughed because it was quite funny. If @ PERSON2 and @ CAPS1 weren't such good friends, I think @ PERSON2 would have gotten mad at @ CAPS1 for doing such a thing to him when there were other people in the car besides those two. Friends understand a good sense of humor and know when to do something goes too far, or when the other person will think it's funny and laugh too. So, as you can see, laughter can be cheerful, grateful, boring and / or mean, you just need to know when it's okay to do it and when it's best not to laugh. Although this is a natural reaction, it is a reaction that can be controlled and thought through before doing so. The next time someone says something funny, first ask yourself if it might be offensive to someone before laughing at it and hurting someone. Otherwise, enjoy life and be happy.
One day, I decided to go to my friend @ PERSON1. When I went there we cleaned the pool and I ran away from his dad because he was chasing me with poop on his finger. It was one of the days that me and @ PERSON1 laughed more than ever ! We started the day by sleeping awkwardly and watching a movie on her tiny @ CAPS1. I don't really remember what the movie was like, but it didn't really matter because we were too busy talking about totally random stuff. After the movie ended, we went to the living room to watch @ CAPS2 bob because @ PERSON1 has no cable in their bedroom. At the time I had a knee injury so it took me a minute to feel comfortable. I settled on the couch and @ PERSON1 sat down next to me. Her father arrived about @ NUM1 minutes later with poop on his index finger. He threatened to give me poo lip, that's where he puts the poo on your lip, and I got up and tried to run away. I knew if I didn't run away he would really put my lip on me because he already had. it hurt a lot to put so much pressure on my knee so i was hoping as fast as possible on one leg. I hid in @ PERSON1's closet and all I could hear in the background was @ PERSON1's laughter and his father's footsteps. I waited in her closet for about @ NUM2 minutes and walked out because I could tell the coast was free. I went back to the living room and @ PERSON1 and laughed about it all. After we stopped laughing, we decided to go out and clean the pool. we were in the mood to swim and the pool had been outside all winter so it was really nasty. there were tattoo poles, dirt, gooey green stuff, pests and who knows what else. I wouldn't be surprised if there were fish in there. We went in and started to collect all the water with buckets. We hadn't noticed the small poles until then. We didn't want to throw them in the yard with all the rest of the water because we knew they would dry out and die. So every time we picked up a bucket full of water we would go through it and take them all out and put them in a little box that we had saved off the poles and picking up all the water took about @ NUM3 and a half hours. after that we went into the house and looked for pool cleaner and soap. We couldn't find it so we went to get the shampoo. We poured the shampoo all over the bottom of the pool and started scrubbing. It was taking too long and it wasn't much fun, so we had the brilliant idea of shampooing our clothes and slipping on. I slipped a dozen times and so did she. It was difficult to stand. We laughed so hard I almost peed but couldn't get in because I was soaked and had soap all over my body. Once the pool was all clean we had to remove all the soap and water again. It all took about @ NUM4 hours but it was really and we had a lot of laughs. @ PERSON1's mom came home from work and was so happy we cleaned her up as that meant she didn't have to. After my grandpa picked me up, me and @ PERSON1 said goodbye to each other. I came home and thought it was one of the funniest days of my life. Overall, I think that day I laughed more than ever.
@ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 you always felt like there wasn't enough time in the day to do whatever you wanted to do. @ CAPS7 that's what I feel everyday , @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 I find it very tiring and screwed up, and it all started when I got the @ CAPS4 job at @ ORGANIZATION1. Since I got the job, I have never @ CAPS3 once for school, @ CAPS5, and I can hardly rest. little. @ CAPS10 always tired of falling asleep in class or just lazy to get work done @ CAPS4, I would cut back @ CAPS4 hours but I need as much money as I can to help @ CAPS4 mom as much as I can. @ CAPS4 mom hasn't really done much with her @ CAPS2 so now she has nothing left to live on. So I think I @ CAPS3 to help him as much as I can, @ CAPS4 older brother would have @ CAPS3 would have done this responsibility but he had his girlfriend pragnet and moved to live with him @ CAPS2 at an early age. So being the second oldest I find it is @ CAPS4's responsibility to take care of @ CAPS4 mo m. I really like @ CAPS4 mum and she has been there all @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2 unlike @ CAPS4 dad ... so I will do all I can to keep her rich because when she is gone @ CAPS10 I don't know what i would do without it. @ CAPS4 little brother is a pain in @ CAPS4 back he never dose anything to help around the house or like to help @ CAPS4 mum when she's raising rude at home or something so I think @ CAPS10 is going to @ CAPS3 to fix it streath. I know mom won't like it, but "Everyone @ CAPS7" he needs to stop being so lazy and help our mom more. Now back to me @ CAPS10 a good little kid I think anyway, @ CAPS7 @ CAPS10 a trubel maker don't get me wrong but if I did the right things I could be a dry kid. I try to be that kid sometimes but it's just so boring and I can't do it because when I try I feel like @ CAPS10 is trying to be a different person, @ CAPS9 but not me @ CAPS10 a loud, hip kid who is the class clown in the classrooms. As people are always wondering if i @ CAPS3 plans for galeage and all i say is i dont think @ CAPS10 smart calleage and i will be lucky if i graduate . @ CAPS10 trying to bring back the grades @ CAPS4 but @ CAPS9 hard when you @ CAPS3 so many other things to do outside of school like @ CAPS4 work and now seeing winter is about to end on spring is on its way it means the work is going to get a lot busier and I'm going to @ CAPS3 to work a lot more. To tell you the truth, @ CAPS10 I don't know if or how @ CAPS10 is going to do it all. With all of this responsibility I'm going to be a tired teenager, @ CAPS10 I'm sure I can handle it if I really try @ CAPS4 better. All I know is I need to find a better job, less stressful, tiring and fewer days to work but get better paid.
I think laughter is very important. This is very important to me because let's say a student falls and you laugh at him just because you think it's funny that it's going to hurt that student. I think instead of laughing at someone, you could be a good boy and ask them if they're okay and help them get up. It shows this student that he really has a friend who cares a lot about him and doesn't make fun of him and really cares about his best friend. You can also be rewarded for doing something right, but for me that's not really what I get, it's the things I do to help my peers. I think we shouldn't laugh and have a positive attitude and be mature about what we do and what we say and react to things like laughing at someone else. I also think if I had fallen and was really hurt and the kids would laugh at me then that's what I'm learning, respect the students like you want to be respected. So I wouldn't want people to laugh at me so why would I make fun of someone else if I don't want them to laugh at me that's why you should treat your peers respectfully.
One day I was with my friend @ PERSON1. We had been friends for a very long time. I was in a bad mood that day because my dog, taco ran away and I had a fight with my parents. @ CAPS4 asked me if I wanted to go out for a walk, and I said yes. We were really good friends at this point, and @ CAPS4 always knew when something was wrong, although I think I hide @ CAPS1 pretty well. Waking up we passed some kids playing in the park with their parents and a man playing fetch with his dog, @ CAPS1 was sunny and warm. @ CAPS1 was during the summer. We stood on the bridge for a minute, then @ CAPS4 asked me "what's wrong, @ CAPS2 ?" @ CAPS3 @ CAPS1 tells him everything that happened, I told him my dog ran away and my parents were mad at me. I told him I was sad. I don't know why I opened up to him like that, we hardly ever talk about the drama in our lives. we are always laughing and making jokes. I thought @ CAPS4 liked me, actually I was hoping @ CAPS4 liked it. I liked it, I had it for a while. We started talking about everything that was going on in our lives, school, friends, parents and much more. @ CAPS4 put me in a better mood. We decided to go to the park and sit at the picnic tables. We sat across from each other and just sat there talking for a while. Then @ CAPS1 started to get late and I had to get home. I said "thank you for cheering me up, I really needed a laugh and a smile today". @ CAPS4 looked at me and took my hand in his and said "@ CAPS5 should always laugh, because @ CAPS5 never knows who falls in love with your smile." then @ CAPS4 kissed me. This is the day that I will remember for a long time. I'm still with @ PERSON1, we've been together for almost @ NUM1 months now.
Extreme temperatures @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 occur, the situation becomes very dangerous. In my case, the extreme weather was @ CAPS1. I was living at @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION1 at the time and was eight years old. This happened in the middle of @ DATE1, @ CAPS3, near record high temperature @ LOCATION2. The day had peaked at one hundred and twenty-five degrees @ CAPS4, and to make matters worse, all electricity in our neighborhood had been cut. No one had air conditioning, and many people ended up getting seriously ill or injured. We lived in a gated community and everyone got along really well. The locals gathered and pitched tents for shade and provided everyone with cold water. There are some important things you need to remember @ CAPS3 a situation like this is happening you need to have a good attitude because there is no point in complaining, not thinking about @ CAPS1 and helping other people who need it. I don't think our community would have lasted, if it weren't for the great attitude and spirit of everyone, and of course, the laughs. It is so important to have the right attitude in a situation like this. What is the use of complaining and getting angry for no reason? I was told it won't last forever and to keep my head up. I could tell that the many other children and even the adults who complained had a much harder time coping with this situation. It was very difficult for me not to complain, being an eight year old child, but I finally succeeded with the help of a lot of water. If you keep your spirits up and interact with people, the word seems to get by much faster. I remember @ CAPS3 my whole family was in one of the tents, sitting telling funny stories and jokes. I would have much preferred spending a day like this with my family rather than a normal, boring day. Among the many important things you could do is not to think about @ CAPS1. If you don't think about it, you'll have a much better time and you won't complain. It is important in many situations not to think about the subject so as not to be stressed. Saw a lot of people there who just couldn't take it. They were just saying how bad it was, and it was very easy to tell they were all stressed out. If you try to make the situation good and you don't keep thinking about it, you'll be okay no matter how bad it is. During this @ CAPS2 of @ CAPS1, many people needed help. The community was a big help as they set up tents and provided people with water and snacks. However, it started to get bad, people were suffering from @ CAPS1 exhaustion and a lot of them had to be put on @ CAPS5. There were several ambulances there to help people and bring them back to normal. Some people had to go to the hospital and receive additional treatment. The community finally made it through the day with such serious injuries. The current returned around six o'clock. Exhausted, people walked slowly or drove home. Our whole family returned home and immediately turned on the air conditioning. Everyone was so relieved and happy that we were finally out of this situation. Even at night the day was at a low of one hundred and twelve degrees. We played games and told jokes the rest of the night and were able to get through it all. Our family has stayed strong thanks to @ CAPS1, while many others have not lasted. It just shows that "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."
Laughter is such a great joy in my life. If people would never laugh life would be boring and boring, most of my favorite experiences involve @ CAPS9 while having a good time. One of my best laughing experiences was going camping with my friends on the last @ DATE2. I will never forget this experience on the last @ DATE2. In the middle of @ DATE2 on a beautiful sunny day @ DATE1 @ TIME1 my @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 is calling me and @ CAPS2 I asked a bunch of guys to go camping and I should come. Immediately, I @ CAPS3 my parents to let me go with the only exception of submitting my application to @ ORGANIZATION1 before going camping. After making my request, I got in the car, picked up my @ CAPS4 @ PERSON3 and peanut butter and jelly sandwich mixes and set off on an adventure. After arriving at my destination after driving NUM1 miles up the river I saw no one, just two huge tents where my friends were supposed to be. Looking at @ CAPS5 the campsite had been attacked by bears with trash all over the place and a campfire still on, I started looking for my friends. I found @ CAPS1 passed out in one of the tents and tried to wake him up but he was asleep. @ PERSON3 and I not knowing what to do, we sat in the shade of the big trees around us, it was a good @ NUM2 degrees outside. After about five minuets we took a dip and went to investigate. We walked over to the river and found all of our friends jumping off a @ NUM3ft rock into the river and we went for some fun. After jumping about @ NUM4 times each, we made our way back to camp. @ CAPS1 was awake and @ PERSON1, @ PERSON2, @ CAPS7, @ PERSON3 and I all huddled around the campfire @ CAPS8 went back to camp and told jokes all night long. We all really hooked up on this three day camping trip @ CAPS9 and joking around and just being boys. I wouldn't get rid of these memories for the world. After camping I came home and worked a lot of the rest of @ DATE2, but since then I have had very good friendships with all of my camping friends.
Once upon a time on @ DATE1, I had my birthday party and my friends came over. My tree friend brought his projector and hung his @ CAPS1 on it. We played @ CAPS2 : @ CAPS3 on his projector and on my @ CAPS4.V. with my @ CAPS1. Then we got bored and we all went to the living room with the girls and relaxed and hung out for a while and then we had cake, had a frosting fight and played some games. laughing so hard. Then we went to the park which was next to our apartment. We played @ CAPS6, made jokes and laughed a lot more. Then we went back to my house and looked @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 @ NUM1 and laughed at the people screaming. Then we play spin the bottle / truth or dare and we had a lot of laughs.
The only true story I can remember that involves laughing was about @ NUM1 years ago at the beach. I was with my mom and sister @ LOCATION1. I was running away from the incoming waves when I decided to only encounter a single wave that swept over me and spun me around for what seemed like an eternity, but wasn't even NUM2 seconds away. I laughed so much I tripped and started spinning again, my mom had to get up because I couldn't stop. I had so many cuts in the sand it was hilarious. after changing, I got a big chest that my dad could put in. This is the only time I remember laughter being my real friend.
My @ CAPS1 year in high school started off less favorably than most. At the end of my eighth grade, I found out that my friends weren't as loyal as I thought when we started our friendship, and in turn I started high school without any. It wasn't that bad because I got to see things for myself for one of the first times in my life. Of course I sulked but looking back on it now I appreciate this moment which has helped me to know myself better. However, you cannot live without friends so I quickly tried to conform to what was considered "normal". I was lucky from the start, but I was always despised to be abandoned by all the people I once considered friends and who in turn saw these recipients as little more than acquaintances. Like most acquaintances, we only spoke in class and kept the conversation informal about nothing more than trivial facts. I wanted to have "real" friends, but I wasn't sure what a real friend was. I guess these so-called acquaintances considered me a friend although I can never be sure whether this is true or not. So I continued my days with one person to talk to in each class but no one to sit with for lunch. This circumstance was however made more desirable because my sister was still attending high school at this point. Her presence made my life a little easier because I could confide in her and even have lunch with her. People who have always had @ MONTH1 friends don't get it, but when you have nowhere to sit for lunch it can be a bit lonely. Fortunately, my sister was always there for me, even though she missed a lot of schools. And when she wasn't there, I could count on her friends to keep me company. I discovered that even though I couldn't find my own friends, I could still share my sisters. This nomadic existence continued until the second quarter of my year @ CAPS1. I had known all of the classes and felt like it was a new beginning and anything could happen, and really anything I could imagine was happening. It started off the same way as the previous quarter. I went to my first couple lessons and got to know more as usual and felt like things couldn't change after all. However, after five minutes of sitting alone in my clothing construction class, two girls entered and sat down at my table. Their conversation caught my attention and held her back. I knew it was wrong to listen to other people's conversations, but I figured that if they didn't want me to overhear, they would have spoken quietly. While I can't remember the real topic of the conversation, I do remember that it was a hilarious topic. Even though I didn't take part in the discussion, I couldn't help but be overwhelmed with laughter as the two spoke. They then started to laugh so hard that tears filled their eyes. In turn, my eyes also started to fill with tears from the extreme laughter. One of the two girls looked at me and said aloud to her friend to " look at her, she is laughing at you so much that she is crying !" " I struggled to stop laughing long enough to introduce myself. Before I knew it we became close friends and it was all due to the incredible power of laughter that can bring strangers together into best friends.
I will tell you a story of smiles, laughter and love. The story of my @ DATE3 and how I changed a girl's life and mine with only smiles and laughs. I have three great memories of my time with her, there was the first smile, the day at the beach and the @ TIME1 at @ LOCATION4. Starting at the beginning, these memories are about me and my neighbors, exchange student @ PERSON1 and they are memories, they are not perfect. The @ TIME1 I made @ PERSON1 smile. It was a cool @ DATE2 @ TIME1 on the back lawn of the grandmothers house overlooking @ ORGANIZATION1's throat, perfect for watching the fireworks. The lawn was even sloped so you didn't have to sit down. @ CAPS1 and @ PERSON1 came to sit with me while I waited for the show. @ PERSON1 was seated to my left and @ CAPS1, my longtime neighbor and friend, to the right. I was very curious about @ PERSON1, what she looked like, what part of @ LOCATION3 she lived in, how her costumes were different from ours. So I started asking him a few questions while we waited. I didn't understand much, it was obvious that she was shy, very shy. Finlay, I had a conversation between the three of us about the fireworks that had started. @ PERSON1 was telling us that the fire in the house at @ LOCATION3 was much bigger than ours. Of course, being sarcastic, I said "@ CAPS2 really". She just smiled. the rest of @ TIME1, the conversations went much more freely between me and @ PERSON1 and it was a wonderful evening. Then we have the day at the beach. This happened about @ DATE1 for memory @ TIME1. @ PERSON1 and I were good friends and she had lost her shyness and I was starting to really like her. We got to the beach the beach down on @ ORGANIZATION1 @ LOCATION1. It was starting to get a hot day, a perfect day for the beach. We unpacked the towels and other random beach stuff. Soon we were all in the water, @ PERSON1, @ CAPS1 (@ PERSON1's host sister), @ CAPS4 (CAPS1's boyfriend) and me. In the mood to flirt, I started splashing out @ PERSON1 who happened to be @ CAPS1. It started a really big splash war with everyone splashing everyone. Everyone was laughing and having a good time. He stopped abruptly because not everyone wanted any more water in their face. Shortly after I dove underwater and tried to lift @ PERSON1 and then drop her in the water, the underlay failed because I missed and only grabbed her right leg. Nothing happened, just more and more laughter. It was a good wet day at the beach. Finally, my @ TIME1 memory is @ TIME1 at @ LOCATION4. We had just finished dinner and it was @ PERSON1 at @ TIME1 at @ LOCATION1 @ LOCATION1. Now we were practically boyfriend and girlfriend. It was getting dark at @ LOCATION2 @ LOCATION4 as we came to @ LOCATION4 forMovies in @ LOCATION4 .. @ TIME1 at @ CAPS7 was playing this @ TIME1. I found a good spot and put the blanket down. we were lying there talking while we waited for the movie to start. I had a flashback of all the laughs that brought us together. I knew at one point that I would truly miss her more than anyone before. It was like the right time as the sun set over the valley, I leaned over and kissed her and she kissed me back, I'll spare you the rest. Afterwards, we laughed and cried. Because she was leaving early the next morning and we were in love. Yes, I have used the world @ CAPS8 but it was and is true. We absolutely didn't want the movie to end and yet he did. As I drove her home from her foster family we talk about the amazing @ DATE3 we had together and all the smiles and laughs we shared. I smiled and laughed a lot this @ DATE3 and it brought me closer to someone. @ PERSON1 and i still talk almost everyday its hard but i have never felt closer to her than anyone else. I will always have memories of this @ DATE3, @ DATE2 from @ DATE2, that day at the beach, and @ PERSON1 "s @ TIME1 @ TIME1 at @ LOCATION1. Hope you enjoyed my story. @ DATE3 and I hope you can have an amazing @ DATE3 like me.
Summer is always the highlight of the year for teens. It's when the temperatures are at their highest that we can stay outside for later, and it's when we have the best memories of our childhood that we will never forget. It seems like you never get bored at this time of year. Everyone always seems to come together and find something crazy and fun to do. @ CAPS2, @ LOCATION1 and I were sitting at home doing nothing and decided we were hungry. Without us having a car, we had to walk everywhere so we chose the place closest to @ LOCATION1's house, which at the time was @ ORGANIZATION1. We left @ ORGANIZATION1 around ten and started walking around, trying to find something to do. We texted @ CAPS1 and found out he was with @ PERSON1 so we all decided we wanted to hang out at @ ORGANIZATION2. We had absolutely no idea where he lived so they told us to meet them at the skate park. By this time it was quite dark and we were still walking. When we got to the park it was quite late. @ CAPS1 and @ PERSON1 arrived a few minutes later, so we started walking towards @ ORGANIZATION2's house. @ PERSON1 has the most evil cat I have ever met. @ CAPS1 has told me stories and shown me videos on this cat a million times before. When we got there it was bouncing off the walls and @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS2, and I was afraid of it. We didn't want him near us because we thought he was going to attack us, eventually he did it several times. @ PERSON1 was pointing the laser pointer everywhere for the cat to chase after it and we were just sitting there still bored. They were looking in our handbags and saw that we had swimsuits because we had been to the beach earlier which gave them the wonderful idea to go fishing at one in the @ TIME1. We all piled into the car and headed for the sea wall. We got there with our tank tops and short shorts on and it was freezing cold. We were huddled to warm up. We couldn't see the ground and kept tripping over small holes and tree trunks everywhere. We finally came to a small dock that looked like it was ready to break and sink at any point. @ PERSON1 grabbed his @ CAPS3 fishing rod and walked over to the edge of the dock. There was no way the rest of us could all stand on it without breaking. We were taking a ton of pictures and had a blast watching @ PERSON1 trying to fish and @ CAPS1 just being @ CAPS1. In the end, we found something to do from scratch. When people experience greatness in the little things, they realize that they could benefit from everything much more. That night was one of the most memorable nights of this @ DATE1.
I was about ten years old when this story happened to me. I was with my grandmother when the story happened. We were at the park and I put my head in the monkey bars. My grandmother had gone to the bathroom and I was stuck in the monkey bars. The children in the park thought it was funny and made fun of me. I was really embarrassed. When I got my head out of the monkey bars I told the kids that they should try putting my head in the monkey bars. The other kids tried to do it and they all got their heads stuck in the monkey bars. The kid didn't know that I had practiced putting my head in the monkey bars so that it wouldn't get stuck. I was laughing really hard at what I had just done and when my grandmother came out I asked if we could go home. The next day we went back to the park and I had different kids with the same ride. What I don't understand is if my head got stuck, why would they try the same. This time the kids told mum and dad what I had done and they told my grandmother and I had a lot of problems. We got home and I was punished for about two weeks. The next time I went to the park I did the same. It shows that children will be children.
Friendship and laughter go @ CAPS1 in @ CAPS1 @ CAPS3 best friend and I spent hours sitting on his bed laughing at nothing. We could tell each other stories that other people thought would be just plain silly, but for us it was hilarious. We would stay awake all night watching sad movies and laughing at each other when we caught each other crying. But that was all before the big fight. We've had fights before but none like this. I knew the decision I would make would ruin our friendship and make us laugh, but I couldn't let her get away with what she had done. So I said goodbye. @ CAPS3's best friend name is @ CAPS4, we know each other in the sense that there were two of us and were inseparable back then. We love to go out and be together. That was until the fight where I was told that she had lied about a boy and me. I remember the pain and how disappointing it was to hear that she would do this to me. But I didn't care enough to tell her about it, so I ended the friendship. It hurt but I had convinced myself to believe it was all true. But something was wrong, something told me it wasn't her. But I didn't want to hear it. I ignored this feeling and moved on with my life. It was one of the most difficult things I have ever done in @ CAPS3's life. School was a whole different story, it's really hard to stay mad at someone when you have the same friends and have a few lessons together. It was like I had to keep reminding myself "you're not friends anymore, you don't have to talk to her anymore", as if subconsciously I didn't want to end the friendship. I missed talking to him, so one day I said hello, after that we talked all the time, it was like nothing had ever happened between us. Except that one thing was missing, laughter. Sensation then we got closer, we hadn't talked about the fight, but it got to the point where we could sometimes laugh or laugh at something that one of us had said, but never the kind of laughs that we shared before. . I never thought we could have talked, yet become friends again. After a few weeks, we both sighed for a youth camp. During this camp, I discovered the truth. We talked about the whole ordeal and agreed that the whole fight was our fault. Mine because I didn't want to know the truth, and her because she didn't try hard enough to show me the truth. During this conversation we shed a few tears and for the first time in about four months we laughed together. The tension between us broke and fell from our shoulders like a very heavy sack we had both carried. We both apologized for our part in everything and then went to dinner and laughed throughout the meal. I realize now that I can't take laughter for granted, it is a very important part of life and you laugh the most when you are with people you love. Sam and I are still working on things between us, but we're about to be closer than ever. We laugh all the time and never get bored, we both decided to work really hard not to have another argument between us. We both realized that there are two very important things in life and that is friendship and the laughter within friendship. I really like @ CAPS3's best friend and I love the laughter we share together just as much, and I don't want to lose it anymore. So every day I'm going to make sure we laugh as much as possible and I will never take our friendship for granted again.
Laughter is always the answer. It was cold and dark outside. The way back was too long to handle, but the laughter filling the air made the way back a little quicker and shorter. The cars kept passing and going up, but all we could do was laugh a little more because we knew we were making fun of ourselves, we didn't care at all. The weird voices coming out of our mouths, the crazy dance moves of @ CAPS1 and the facial expressions were the funniest thing for us. The stupid things people do are the funniest things. Because I knew that if you laugh more than usual, you will build your friendship more and live your life more fully. As @ PERSON2 and I walked back from @ PERSON1 we were on our way back. It looked like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes from my house, not even that. I also felt like we weren't going anywhere because of how slow our walk was and how long it took. The cars kept passing us, but they weren't moving towards us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea to make the walk faster. I remembered that voice from my god brother @ CAPS2 that was like @ CAPS3 to me even though he is younger would still do. It always made everyone smile and it was fun. This voice, I wanted to try it, so I tried. We weren't even halfway until I started shouting random words over the cars, it was a dark creepy voice and I looked very controlling. Then I had the brilliant idea to sing with this deep and scary voice. It was a bad idea too, @ PERSON2 started dancing and the cars started staring at us. @ PERSON2 was this tall slim girl who was my best friend, she loved piercings and didn't care what other people thought of her. I didn't really care what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @ PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I have ever seen. I never thought anything could get funnier than that, until she wanted to try vocals. When she tried the voice and slipped from her lips, I started laughing out loud and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost home and I felt like our stomachs were going to burst from the length and strength of the laughter. While thinking to myself I thought "@ CAPS4, felt like two minutes just to get home." I knew if @ PERSON2 and I just thought about something to do until we got home, the time would go by faster. When we walked through the door to my house my mom asked us, "@ CAPS5 were you dancing as you walked down the @ NUM1 and I just looked at myself laughed and told her that she didn't even know how much fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people together, I think. It doesn't matter if you make a fool of yourself because you know what's fun. All that matters is that. is that you build a relationship together. It doesn't matter if it's just friends trying to get to know each other better or if it's a boyfriend / girlfriend having fun and messing around. It's always good to have that laughter here and there and not that you have that connection with the other person and not your friendship is still there.
In @ DATE1, a main group of friends were looking for different adventures to join. This group of people consisted of children of all ages, @ PERSON5 @ NUM1, @ PERSON1 @ NUM2, @ PERSON2 @ NUM3 and @ PERSON4 @ NUM4. Towards the end of @ DATE2, on a hot day, @ PERSON5 had the idea to go to @ LOCATION2, @ ORGANIZATION2 and do some cliff diving. He called it the "cliffs". So the whole group got together and set off for an hour's drive to @ LOCATION2. Once we got there it just got hotter outside, and the need to cool off became a priority. They parked, then walked on the railroad tracks. The closer they got to their destination, the louder the voices they heard @ CAPS1 became. The place was a secluded area with rocky ground, people started running to jump from the highest peak and crash into the surface of the waters below. Immediately @ PERSON5 and @ PERSON1 wanted to settle down to be able to join the others. As for @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON2, that could wait. Once @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON5 got started, @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON2 thought maybe it was time to give it a try. But not from the highest peak. Maybe something a little lower. Something like the bottom of the cliff, just to start. Before they jumped they noticed a small beach on the other side of the creek so the girls chatted with the boys and they all decided to jump at the same time and swim to the small beach. Although they all jumped from different heights, they all seemed to be arriving around the same time. For @ PERSON5 it was a little harder to swim this far. But @ PERSON4 was right by his side to help him along the way. As the group relaxed in the air of @ DATE1 for a while, they realized that they @ CAPS1 were hungry, but far too lazy to swim, climb rocks, and hike up the railroad tracks to the car. But hunger was taking over. As they swam back, scaled the rocks, gathered their things and went home, they started to think of a place to eat. "@ CAPS1 will go through @ CAPS2." @ PERSON1 said. "@ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 !" @ PERSON4 shouted. At that time the decision was made. On the way back, they changed the driver and the seating arrangement. Once they got to @ CAPS2 they all stopped by @ ORGANIZATION1 and filled their bellies. They all chose to stop at @ PERSON5 work @ ORGANIZATION3, to say hello to some of their friends. @ PERSON4 was @ PERSON5's girlfriend, so they had something to show off. They all ended up saying they were hello and drove back to @ LOCATION1's house where all of @ CAPS1's cars parked. @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON5 decided to take a shower, while @ PERSON1 wanted to play video games, as for @ PERSON2, she came home to take a shower and get ready to meet up with her friends. @ NUM5 hours later they all headed to their meeting place, which they called "the place". They invited some of their friends @ PERSON6 @ NUM3 and @ PERSON3 @ NUM7. They made a campfire as the sun was setting because it was getting colder and colder. While @ PERSON1, @ PERSON3, @ PERSON6 and @ PERSON2 @ CAPS1 sitting around the fire on chairs, @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON5 @ CAPS1 strolling around the campsite (which was really a huge piece of @ PERSON5 mom's land) on a quad. The group took turns on the quad but one ride in particular made memories. After @ PERSON5 and @ PERSON4 returned, @ PERSON2 wanted to give @ PERSON4 a ride. So @ PERSON5 jumped up, and @ PERSON2 jumped up, while @ PERSON4 wrapped his arms around his waist, and they left. There was a certain trail where there was a long way to go so the driver always had to find a way around it. Usually it worked, this time it didn't. @ PERSON2 hesitated to just pass over it. She was afraid of all the power. @ PERSON4 really didn't seem to care, and she took over and slammed on the gas. They tied it high on the log and rolled the quad straight away. @ PERSON4 did not weigh so much that it flew away, @ PERSON2 on the other had caught its foot under the handle. @ PERSON4 had the strength to lift the quad off his foot, and @ PERSON2 got out right away. @ PERSON4 decided to call the boys, and they jumped straight into @ PERSON1 to come and save them. @ PERSON5 overturned the quad and climbed on it and came back behind @ PERSON1. This memory will never be forgotten in the group, even if the group will never be the same again.
the trip @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I just woke up when I got a sound of laughing on the stairs. I went down the stairs and saw @ PERSON2, my nursery laughing with @ PERSON1 one of my coworkers. she drove me and @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON3 for the plane ride to @ LOCATION1. I was scared because my father Jack died on a plane. I will not focus on this topic. When we landed it was the most fun of the ride :) the bumps in the @ CAPS2 were so bumpy, @ CAPS3 we found our bags and went to the shuttle bus where we went to the hotel. We paid for the shuttle and went to hotel rooms (I laughed at @ LOCATION2 because he spilled soda on his shirt). @ CAPS3 since we only had two days in the park, we had to stay at the hotel for The first day, for dinner, we ate at a restaurant named Chubby s. It was the most unpleasant food I have ever eaten. the next day we got ready i was wearing a polo shirt, sunglasses and shorts and the shoes i was wearing were converse (low cut) what fashion don't you think @ CAPS4 (laugh out loud)
I moved to @ LOCATION4from @ LOCATION5 with my family when I was just a kid. We moved the small town of @ CAPS1, @ ORGANIZATION2, where we have lived for @ NUM1 years. Over the years, there have been a lot of difficult times, but we have always managed to overcome them by laughing together as a family. This past year has been particularly trying, and I don't think we would have survived if we hadn't been able to celebrate the tragic moment with a laugh. My @ CAPS2 stayed at @ LOCATION5 when we moved to @ LOCATION1 because he was sick and didn't think he could survive the trip. Last year we finally convinced him to @ CAPS3 here with the rest of the family. He moved in with my family and shared my room. It was hard because he was snoring and making strange noises in his sleep, but I was glad he was with us. When I would wake up tired from lack of sleep, I would just think about the funny noises and laugh. Then six months ago my @ CAPS2 was diagnosed with a brain tumor. There was nothing the doctors could do for him and told us he only had a few weeks to live. We were devastated and I couldn't stop crying. We asked @ CAPS2 what he wanted to do. He said, "I want you all to stop making it look like I'm already dead and let's have some fun!" It was like @ CAPS2. He said we were going on a trip to @ LOCATION2 so he could go to @ LOCATION3 before he left this world. I couldn't help but laugh at how crazy he could be. Sure enough, when I got home from school on the next @ DATE1, @ CAPS2 told us we had ten minutes to pick up what we needed and get in the van. He had gone out and hired a @ NUM2 van for the trip so that all of the family could go. We just watched it. He started to laugh and said, "@ CAPS3 that or you stay behind!" I started to laugh too, and rushed inside to pack my bags. It was the best trip of my life. @ CAPS2 told us all kinds of crazy stories about his childhood. Mom wrote down a few so that we can always remember them. When we got to @ LOCATION3, we made all the exits from the park. @ CAPS2's favorite was @ ORGANIZATION1. He wasn't supposed to drive it because of his condition, but he just laughed and said, "I'm sure that won't kill me." @ CAPS4 even though it made me sad when he said it, I still laughed because he was so happy. Two months after we got home, @ CAPS2 passed away. @ CAPS4 although it was difficult and I cried many times, I can't help but laugh when I think about this trip and how much fun we had. @ CAPS2 taught me that laughter can make all the difference in turning any situation around.
My newest botfriend and I have been dating for almost @ NUM1 months on @ DATE1 it will be a year. We have a lot of fun together, we talk about everything we don't really do cycling or jogging, we just started training together. My parents love him, they call him son-in-law over there, I think he's kinda cute. barbecues everything. It was like @ TIME1 and we were ready to go to bed alright Randy had no idea we were going to spend the night either, but we did. there is a house so we asked Randy if we could use a hotel room he said yes of course. On the day @ TIME1 we had to pay him a little money not yet all but a part and we went to our hotel room. Me and @ CAPS1 were looking at it and it had a king size bed with a whirlpool tub, I hopped on it and it was the best. So @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 on shorts and me @ CAPS2 my swimsuit on us @ CAPS2 inside the hot tube and had a blast :) so glad I didn't fall on my face then @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and I did the same, it was a bit funny but not really but at the same time it was. Me and @ CAPS1 were really hungry and all we had was a bag of crisps and cheese dip when @ CAPS1 ate the crisps he was making that funny noise like the war star chubaka. this was the best time ever @ CAPS2 to watch sadalight tv i dont have this in my house so all we have to watch is dvds and maybe vhs but anyway , we brought the @ NUM2 with us. We were in the room playing this game called Honor Metal, it's kind of like a war game, but with a lot of guns we kinda had the TV on, but I didn't think not that it was that loud i guess the nehbordid. After about @ NUM3 to @ NUM4 minutes we heard a knock on the door it was the nehbor he was asking if everything was ok as he heard loud noises and gunshots coming from the room. game we have for playstation sorry to bother sir i didn't think it was so loud. So we turned down the TV and played the game for about @ NUM5 hours so by the time we went to bed it was like @ NUM6 on @ TIME1 morning I was so tired this @ TIME1 day and I had to go to school this very @ TIME1 day. We @ CAPS2 took a shower and when we got back to Randy's house we sat there to have breakfast. After having breakfast, we came home and ate some more at my place. It was as if we had decided towards @ NUM7 that we were going to take a little nap and we ended up sleeping until the day @ TIME1. @ CAPS1 and I @ CAPS2 at @ NUM8 and we couldn't fall asleep sp we stood playing video game for about @ NUM9 hours and I had to get up and go to school I walked into my house dad and I took a shower @ CAPS2 ready for school then I walked out my house and @ CAPS2 wearing my school clothes brushed my hair brushed my teeth then I @ CAPS2 all my business together and relaxed then towards @ NUM10 I got out at my bus stop and waited for the bus when I realized no one was there I walked into my house when @ CAPS1 was laughing what's crazy i thought i was @ DATE3 he said no it's @ DATE2. I was the best new year of my life hope to have another like this and maybe if we're still together on my birthday we could do something as fun hopefully. But I think we will @ CAPS1 treated me so well and I appreciate him and what he does for me. He has also been one of the best friends I have ever had and I hope we will be together for a long time.
The @ CAPS1 is @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 the great-grandmother once told me that laughter adds and five more years to your life, she is currently @ NUM1. Laughter can add a new element to relationships; they are embarking on a journey, whether it is between two friends, family members or something more. More or less, laughter is an essential piece. Sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends, but that's actually how I met one of the good friends at @ CAPS3. The incoming @ CAPS11 participated in a traditional ritual (name game) to which the school submits the incoming @ CAPS11 during orientation. They put us in long lines facing each other. For this particular game, you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner as well as an interesting fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing, but we got to laugh about it. A whole new feeling pervades the room. That overwhelming and uncomfortable feeling just went away and it was all because of the laughter. It broke that barrier and allowed us to open up. I guess it's really true that "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people". @ CAPS4 back, some of @ CAPS3's best friendships were uplifted with laughter. When I joined the cross country team, for example, the whole team, unlike most other sports teams, was like one big family. We share socks, @ CAPS5- @ CAPS6, t-shirts, shorts, water, sometimes even our watches, but we also laughed a lot. Even while we are running, we are talking to our friends and joking around, but trust that laughing while running is not easy! I think the best memory of @ CAPS3 was when we had our "@ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9". The whole team of eighteen @ CAPS7 or so met at @ LOCATION1 about a week before the districts. The @ CAPS10 was to bring snacks, @ CAPS11 was to bring drinks, and @ CAPS12 was to bring the candy, and the @ CAPS13 was all participating for "main ingredient". That first bit of @ CAPS8 was correct, but everyone expected this hour hand to strike noon. When it happened, we were @ CAPS9. The "main ingredient" in this @ CAPS8 was toilet paper. We were going @ CAPS9 on a tee-pee raid! The first event was the fork in the coaches' lawn ; but not with any old forks, these forks were special. For some reason the coach had this weird obsession with @ CAPS14, so despite this, some of @ CAPS7's photos stuck his head over the bodies of the @ CAPS14 lawn. I was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible. I don't think I could ever have @ CAPS16 with something this smart. After this short stop, we were on the main event, the tee-peeing. We tried to pee one of the brothers on the team, but now daddy was already waiting. The other pair of brothers was next. All the cars slowly approached the culdesac, we lowered the radios and turned off all the headlights. Just to be sure, everyone made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape. Almost in sync, everyone there threw the first roll towards the big tree at the side of the house. We kept running out and the rollers were falling and unraveling in the street, we could have been called the worst tee peers ever. Then all of a sudden three characters came bolting @ CAPS9 on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper shouting, "@ CAPS15 ! Come back here, you forgot something !". We were ambushed! As we sprinted backwards, we barely reached the cars. Yet something was wrong. There was just that weird feeling, like in a horror movie. Then; suddenly, as we were starting to drive away, something big hit the car. In a panic, @ ORGANIZATION1 stopped the car and had to get @ CAPS9 to make sure no one had been hit. “@ CAPS16 grab your toilet paper!” A deep voice shouted. Everyone @ CAPS7 started screaming in terror. What was going to happen now? What was even going on? Were we going to be killed? No, and luckily we weren't killed this @ CAPS8 ! In relief, we found out there was only @ PERSON1, @ PERSON2, and @ LOCATION2, but I might as well have had a heart attack. Instantly the whole group burst into laughter @ CAPS9 and I had laughed so hard I started to cry. I have never laughed so much in the life of @ CAPS3 and I will never forget it. The @ MONTH1 laugh did not bring together just two people, but almost twenty. When the Districts passed I know everyone was sad to see the @ CAPS16 season come to an end. It was @ CAPS13 last season and no one wanted to see them go; but all the good times we had will never be wasted, and the links are @ CAPS2.
What is laughter ! How many friends do you really have ? How do you relate to others? Well, I'm in high school and usually don't have a lot of friends. But I have a few and a friend of mine @ CAPS4 friends with someone I really love. (@ CAPS1 didn't know) @ CAPS2 year I was a freshman and went to church with some of my friends and it was a grader @ NUM1 that fell into the pond / water and I wasn't sure @ CAPS20 @ CAPS1 was @ CAPS3 or not, so I ended up walking up to him and asking him. @ CAPS4 you @ CAPS3 ?, do you need help? @ CAPS1 said; @ CAPS6, it's @ CAPS3 I just sprained my ankle. Me; @ CAPS3, see you later then. Him. Later, thanks for asking si.me; @ CAPS9 of course, @ CAPS6 problem ! The following year, when I was in second year, I didn't realize that @ CAPS1 was going to be their first year ! his name is @ CAPS11 I was starting to spend more time with him because @ CAPS1 was so funny and sweet. We went to prom @ CAPS12 together and our other friends were theirs but i was worried about some stuff but @ CAPS1 made it dope because at that point i was scared my ex was their. @ CAPS11 was their to help me and I also didn't know how to dance and it was a song that was on and I didn't realize I was dancing until @ CAPS1 told me I was so much after dancing with him i ended up asking him @ CAPS20 I can dance with one of our friends and @ CAPS1 said he was able to too so me and @ PERSON1 end up dancing and @ CAPS1 was theirs when i needed him. We end up going out and I called @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14 to get picked up. So during that time, we were outside waiting for him. We laughed at some jokes we told each other @ CAPS15. As one was that @ CAPS1 @ CAPS15 something in his @ CAPS15 and acted like that it was kind of a wand for the school building and @ CAPS15 asked like that it was changed to a gingerbread house. Just a week ago I ended up sneaking up behind him and scared him so much I ended up laughing and @ CAPS1 was too. Because @ CAPS1 usually doesn't panic like that, and @ CAPS1 told me that @ CAPS1 was going to pick me up and I'm starting to panic because I don't know what @ MONTH1 is. @ CAPS11 is a big help when I need him ! The thing about laughter in life is that you would need to eat ether in a way that you were upset or not in the mood. like my sister is walking out of the room and her soda is in the room i am in she is always @ CAPS15 about half the soda in the can there was mustard on the table and she hates mustard to because of its taste but my dad was thinking the same thing I wanted to do and that was put some mustard in his soda. When she came back to the room I was smiling and my dad was looking at my @ CAPS17 too. My sister ended up having some soda and she was looking at my @ CAPS14 and thought to herself: @ CAPS16, who put mustard in my soda? My @ CAPS17, @ CAPS18, @ CAPS14 and I were laughing and she hates mustard !, @ CAPS20 that was something I didn't like that got in my soda, I would have done that too. So most of the time I'm trying to say is there are some funny laughs. not all laughs are funny. Its buttery @ CAPS20 you don't play pranks on the people you care about because they @ MOIS1 get mad at you. Like my sister, @ PERSON2 was mad at me when it wasn't me, it was my dad's idea.
The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 on the day of @ DATE1 I was @ NUM1 and me and my best friend were at home I called him to see what he had planned for that beautiful sunny day and he told me he had nothing in mind so we kept trying to think of something but for @ NUM2 hours we were unlucky. I called him again and we met at an elementary school and we just sat @ CAPS3 on a bench and started calling people to see what was going on with everyone and no one would answer the phones . It got around @ NUM3 pm when we stopped calling people to do airplanes so my friend asked me if I wanted to go get something to eat I told him we didn't have lucky throughout @ DATE2 @ TIME1. What sucks is that it was @ DATE2 of @ DATE3, and the school was going to start @ CAPS3 @ DATE4. As we were walking to a fast food restaurant we noticed a flyer saying @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS3 a street that looked familiar, so my friend asked me if I wanted to go find her and see what was going on and what was going on. . We followed the signs for a street we knew pretty well, until we started to hear music banging in the distance, then we walked over a mile and saw a good friend of mine and he m 'said he was going to get some lights for a @ ORGANIZATION1 and I asked him who was there and he said I had to see for myself. So we walked around the corner, we were @ CAPS3 and saw the @ ORGANIZATION1, we walked up to the door and saw another friend standing at the door, we asked him where everyone was we got bored all day with nothing to do @ CAPS3 my own @ CAPS1 and he told me it's here now and that's all that matters so we walked in and saw everyone we called @ DATE5 and up and they yelled at me @ CAPS5 @ CAPS1 and I was shocked why this @ ORGANIZATION1 is for me and how did I get to my own accident @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS3. I eventually found out this was planned for me all the time, guess the restaurant flyer was put there for the purpose of @ CAPS3 and my friend was @ CAPS3 that little @ CAPS2 to take me to @ ORGANIZATION1 and everything was planned from the start of the day so that people wouldn't answer my calls or my friends but to make me go buy food and find the flyer and make me go to my own @ ORGANIZATION1 and I thanked everyone and especially my friend who got me to go get some food to find my own flyer @ CAPS1 @ ORGANIZATION1 and we all had a good laugh, The @ CAPS8 !
My @ CAPS1, my friend and I were driving down the road to pick up a mutual friend for a youth group that evening. Our conversation was anything but special. We mostly told stories of fun times we had already had with our old friend, and we were eager to experience new ones together. She was such an amazing person. Always ready to make a joke, make new friends and have a good time. Her smile was cute and she was ready to convince someone to do anything. When we got home, we were delighted to be able to see her again. It had been weeks since the last "play date", and we couldn't wait to catch up with her. She walked through her front door and trotted to our car. The smile on his face was enough to tell us that the feeling of being reunited was mutual. As we got out of the car, we received bear hugs from her. The fun times we had together flashed through my mind, and I hoped there would be many more that I could come back to someday. We all got in the car, got out of his neighborhood, and started out on the road. I realized we were going the wrong way. "@ CAPS1, we have to go back the other way, don't we ?" I asked. “@ CAPS2, but the barrier in the middle of the road won't let me make a @ CAPS3 turn until the street goes up a bit,” she said. "@ CAPS4, is that even legal?" I asked, knowing the answer would be no. "@ CAPS5, I don't really have a choice now, do I @ CAPS6 ?" I could hear the sarcasm in his voice. She could make her voice and appearance sound mean, but I knew that in reality she was only playing with me. The barrier dissipated and she was about to make the @ CAPS3 turn. As she turned the wheel, she barely made it past the end of the barrier, but it was too late to be able to stop in time to cross the curb on the other side. She accidentally backed out onto the sidewalk, startling and wobbling those of us in the backseat from the impact. My friends and I were all laughing, knowing that she was generally very careful and had good driving skills. “@ CAPS8 everyone,” she said. Her body language showing that she was having fun, but that she was really @ CAPS8 for giving us a dump like that. Our response was pure laughter. “@ CAPS5, I guess this is our monthly treat,” she said, her eyes sparkling with glee making us laugh. She was always very quick to joke about the situations we found ourselves in. She stepped forward, the rear fender scraping the curb again as we exited. As we left, my friends and I were still laughing, replaying what had just happened to us in our minds. It was one of our fondest memories together. A continual joke that we can just conjure up, and that bursts out laughing because of it. “@ CAPS10 for the @ PERSON1 ride,” my friends said as we got out of the car. We walked into a group of young people laughing, knowing that this would be one of the many memories we would cherish forever. Bring us closer than ever.
My best friend @ CAPS1 and I have known each other since we were two years old. We've helped each other through good times and bad, and we're there for each other like chocolate on a bad day. The best quality about @ CAPS1 is the fact that she can make me laugh no matter what mood I'm in. This year @ CAPS1 decided to go to @ ORGANIZATION4's, a @ CAPS3 @ ORGANIZATION2 at @ LOCATION1, instead of continuing to @ ORGANIZATION1 like me. On the first day of @ ORGANIZATION2, I felt something was missing. @ CAPS1. Without his cackling laugh echoing through the hallways, it was strangely quiet. It reminded me of a place where we made most of our hilarious memories, and where we were told to "shhh" a lot too. Our little brick church @ CAPS3! Most @ DATE1 I got up on the altar with the priest and helped him bake bread and the like. And most of @ DATE1, my best friend @ CAPS1 was on the bench. One @ DATE1 in particular that I will never forget, @ CAPS1 thought it would be fun to sit in the front row with my family and make faces at me throughout Mass. See @ CAPS1, she has the power to make you laugh just by smiling at you. When she makes faces, I usually wake up with tears in my eyes. I was standing in front of the whole congregation and using every ounce of self-control so as not to laugh out loud. The congregation must have thought that I was really changed by @ CAPS8 because I had the biggest smile on my face. I'm sure you've been in one of those situations where it's physically impossible to stop laughing. You need to bite your lip, think of something sad, or try some breathing exercises. Every time I glanced in her direction a new wave of laughter washed over me, and every time I glanced in my mother's direction her evil eye burned harder. After what seemed like an eternity to me the choir sang the closing hymn and once we left the building I couldn't stop laughing for at least ten minutes. I had bit my lip so hard that there were ridges indented inside my mouth. Usually after church we go to @ ORGANIZATION3 for coffee and donuts. We catch up with @ ORGANIZATION2, and everyone now lives that we don't see each other as often. She tells me about her new friends and I tell her about our old ones. I always look forward to hearing the hilarious and silly stories of his time, and always keep him informed of the latest and greatest gossip from his hometown. But the thing we always count on is a good laugh with a good friend. Laughter keeps @ CAPS1 and I close. If laughter really adds years to your life, we'll probably be the two old ladies who live on the hill with twenty cats, and no one really knows how old they are because they've been around forever. I can be myself with her and know that she accepts me because if I do something stupid I know she will laugh and then we will go play with her cat, @ LOCATION2, or do some pop- corn and look @ ORGANIZATION2 three. My family must be tired of our endless inner jokes. When I laugh, I feel like liquid gold is bubbling in my stomach and all is at peace in the world. It is one of the most heartwarming feelings in the world. This is how I feel when I laugh with my best friend @ CAPS1.
Beams of light escape through the steamed-up windows casting a shadowy glow across the table's surface. A huge panel hangs over a large oak shelf that lines the entire dining room. @ CAPS16 reads "@ CAPS1's" in big letters buried under decades of dust. My eyes dance among the plethora of antiques and mismatched statues strung throughout the room, easily filling every crevice. These objects form a family of outliers, each individually unique belonging to @ CAPS15 the restaurant. Huge posters of All- @ CAPS2 athletes stand among the @ NUM1 inch flat screens as a pungent scent of molded wood and fermented beer lingers. Many bras fall from the ceiling of the bar which is next to @ CAPS15 the entrance. The sound of the crackle echoes in my ears as the waitresses maneuver over fallen peanut shells. It's @ CAPS4 that sets this place apart from the rest. The whole floor is littered with barrels of @ TIME1's broken shells and mashed peanuts as @ CAPS16 is personalized for @ CAPS15 customers to throw them on the floor. Of course, there is my family; a dynamic group of five squeezing our round frames into a cabin that comfortably seats four. We seem like @ CAPS15 goes pretty well with the crowd of miscellaneous items dressed in our '@ DATE1 @ CAPS3' outfit of skirts and dressy suits. Distracted, I scramble through the menu, searching for something with a little zing and lots of calories. A loud crashing noise breaks my attention and I slide the newspaper-style menu in front of my eyes. On the other side of the table sits my grandmother; a little old lady proudly standing at @ NUM2 who spends her free time attempting a stand up comedy. I study the glass jar of ketchup she's holding and watch her pound the corner on a single peanut. The shell opens and @ ORGANIZATION1 picks up the nuts sweeping its pits on the ground. Just kidding @ CAPS15 myself surprised at the limits of @ CAPS4, this old lady is ready to @ CAPS15 go @ CAPS15. She continues @ CAPS15 and repeats this process with ten more peanuts until the whole family has stopped out of curiosity. Looking up, @ LOCATION1 pauses with the jar hanging in his hand. "@ CAPS4? I'm just trying new ways to crack the nuts." @ LOCATION1 exclaims, pausing for a comedic response. Without reaction, we resume our position contemplating our meal choices. A few minutes later, a heavy waitress reeking of drugstore scent and nighttime hangovers @ TIME1 puts down glasses of water and slowly leaves. Raising his glass, @ CAPS5 motioned for us to follow @ CAPS15. "@ CAPS6 !" @ CAPS7 calls by clinking each of our glasses in turn. "@ CAPS6 ! And @ CAPS6 @ CAPS15 cherry people !" @ LOCATION1 intervenes. "@ CAPS9 @ CAPS10!" I shout automatically. Immediately my parents laughed because my grandmother was never funny. @ CAPS16 is a joke that no one in the family laughs at @ LOCATION1's comments other than herself and this is how @ CAPS16 stays. Years ago, my brother thought of her jokes like "@ CAPS9 @ CAPS10" because she masquerades as an actress but really isn't. From that point on, whenever @ LOCATION1 made a "joke" someone was quick @ CAPS15 would respond by shouting "@ CAPS9 @ CAPS10!" @ CAPS15 to date she has neither improved nor given up on the daily opportunities @ CAPS15 is trying @ CAPS15 to win her audience. In quiet defeat, @ LOCATION1 laughs at herself @ CAPS15 and concentrates on the menu. Seconds later, she is back in the ring for the second round. “@ CAPS16 is noon. So are we having breakfast or lunch? Or should we have… brunch ?! I'm dying to laugh already,” she pleads. For a moment, we all stare at her. Innocent eyes look back; the predator sits calmly while waiting for its prey to move. Then, as if a switch has been flipped, we look at each other and the tape is cut. Snack laughs turn to hoarse cries as thunderous bursts of laughter echo through the room. I give my mom a napkin she uses @ CAPS15 dabbing jubilant tears. The thick wooden shutters of the table under the weight of my father's fist slapped the surface hysterically. I laugh so hard that it hurts my guts and yet I don't understand why everything is so funny. Meanwhile, @ ORGANIZATION1 is in sheer delight, tickled by the success of finally getting a heartfelt response @ CAPS15 to his notorious "jokes". @ CAPS16 is a wonder we are not thrown out of the restaurant. Patrons from the surrounding booths gaze over the edge of their bench looking at us in disgust. However, this isn't the first and it sure wouldn't be the @ TIME1 time my family has caused a scene. Simple but obnoxious jokes are a loosely managed camaraderie in our family that still finds a place in our books of lasting memories. The rest of the meal was spent in laughter and we were more than kindly shown to the door when our meal was over. It's when you get into hysteria for no monumental reason and can't seem to tell @ CAPS16 to someone else who doesn't find @ CAPS16 almost as humorous.) @ CAPS16 are those insignificant moments of the life where we remember who we are and the connections we share. Laughter is a connection, a form of love that is cultivated within society and in families with grandmothers like mine, each "@ CAPS9 @ CAPS10" is worth @ CAPS16.
A long time ago my family @ CAPS6 I went to @ LOCATION1 to see my great aunt @ CAPS6 uncle. They had a log cabin right by the lake, with a tipi @ CAPS1 in the back yard. They had a dock with a really big nice boat @ CAPS6. I had been there with my @ CAPS2, my other aunt @ CAPS6 my two half-sisters. I forgot why we went, but I think it was just because it was @ DATE2 @ CAPS6, my great aunt's uncle @ CAPS6 was getting old. I was very young, @ CAPS7 I only remember @ CAPS6 bits from the trip. I remember watching cartoons with my sister on the couch, watching "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4" in our bedroom, asking my sisters to make me watch my first horror movie (I hate horror movies), going on a go-kart track @ CAPS6 driving for the first time, taking one of the extra small boats @ CAPS6 going out on the lake with one of my older half-sisters, also taking the big boat @ CAPS6 going around the lake with my great-uncle he was going around in circles @ CAPS7 that we would do jump on the wave to make the ride more fun! We drive to @ DATE1, @ CAPS6 where they were selling illegal fireworks statewide for the event of course, but I remember sitting in the car with my two step sisters, @ CAPS6 my @ CAPS2 got out of the car to go @ CAPS6 get fireworks from a roadside booth. We were all @ CAPS7 tired of something, @ CAPS7 we all stayed in the car. Outside the little booth where they sold the fireworks, there was this guy with the inflated balloons ; you know one of those exploding things where there's a face on it @ CAPS6 it just keeps moving @ CAPS6 dancing? Anyway, my older stepsister starts to say "@ CAPS5 look there he's going to do the macarana !" I had no idea what @ CAPS13 she was talking about until she pointed to the exploding guy who was just stirring @ CAPS6 coming to life every second. Then my other stepsister joins in @ CAPS6 starts saying " @ CAPS6 now he's making mashed potatoes! " @ CAPS7 now I'm laughing because it's just @ CAPS7 silly @ CAPS6 funny, I actually thought he was dancing @ CAPS6 doing all those dance steps! Now everyone in the car is laughing @ CAPS6 laughing about something @ silly CAPS7 @ funny CAPS6, I mean we were doing silly dance moves, some not even dance moves, just random objects ! don't stop laughing ! When my @ CAPS2 got in the car she was like "@ CAPS13 !? @ CAPS13 has arrived?!". I tried to explain to her @ CAPS13 was funny @ CAPS7 but she didn't get it. Guess you just had to be there to be part of the ridiculous roadside car stop where they sold fireworks to see why it was @ CAPS7 funny !
Laughter can be a very important thing in everyone's life because it is something that can help you in so many ways. As far as I can remember, laughter has helped me get over a lot of the emotional issues I would have with a lot of my ex-boyfriends. One day my mom saw me cry because my ex broke up with me and I was really upset, so the only thing my mom told me was "laughter was the best doctor" at the time - there I didn't understand what she was trying to say, but now that I'm getting older I'm starting to realize what she thinks is that to be disappointed with something like that is just pointless, and that I had to live my life to the fullest because I was too young to cry for someone I just had a crush on and she was absolutely right about it. But again, it's not just for the boyfriend and girlfriend, it's also for keeping a healthy friendship with your friends. Laughter is a way to show how you feel on the inside. Even when I don't feel like laughing I still do because it's a way of showing people that I'm a strong, independent girl who knows how to take care of herself and live her life. I also try to make people around me laugh and have a good time when we go out because they create the best memories. I'm really surprised how much a simple laugh or smile can make someone feel better and sometimes one person can make another smile just by laughing at the simplest things. On the other hand, there are people who pretend to laugh, which means they are laughing, but it's not that they are laughing because they think you are funny, they are laughing because. they think you are stupid. But the truth is sometimes it's hard to see who the real people are from the fakes because there are a lot of people who pretend to laugh just to pretend they like you when they really don't like you and I think really that is stupid because you end up believing that they are your friends when all they do is laugh behind your back. But I don't let that get to me because those kinds of people are the kind of people that it's not even worth taking your time with. I feel like I made a difference in this day to some people, I know I can't change their life but I can always try to make their day a little easier by just making them laugh. My three month old baby sister is always laughing, always cracking up for no apparent reason and it's quite funny to watch because when she laughs I laugh, that's kind of what I mean when I say that a simple smile or laugh from one person to another can make all the difference. I mean, she's only three months old and she's always happy and always has a smile on her face for no reason sometimes without realizing it she makes my day even better when she suddenly laughs out of the blue, which I find it a bit cute. My mom sometimes tries to make people laugh because she knows I have a bad day at school sometimes and she does her best to make me laugh because when I laugh it makes me forget about all my problems and everything, but i know laughing can't always be all right, for example laughing at other people's pain is just bad and it's something that is not funny and people make fun of other people which can really hurt someone. This in many ways means that laughing can be good or bad, but it also depends on who is laughing.
Personally, I believe that laughter is very important in any relationship. Who doesn't like to laugh every now and then? I know yes. My true story is about the relationship between my @ NUM1 year old granddaughter and me. I'll tell you why I think laughter is important, why it is important, the role it plays in my relationships, and the benefits I think it can have for all people relationships. Everyone needs to smile and laugh, to forget the things that make you frown, so that you can turn everything upside down. My relationship with @ PERSON1 (my @ NUM1 year), still has mixed emotions and is constantly changing. Emotions range from complete happiness and admiration to anger, frustration, and a lot of stress. Of course, during all these different feelings, I still love her with all my heart. But in the midst of feeling so stressed out that I want to scream, she will say the funniest thing or make the cutest face. And you can't help but smile and laugh, which, let me tell you, makes all the difficulties go away for that brief moment. The coldest, angry, and hurtful people in the world never laugh. They isolate themselves and don't have good relationships with others. We all need to laugh in order not to be depressed and sad. If you're still frowning and stressing out, there won't be room to look at the good stuff and just laugh. When @ PERSON1 does her little thing and it makes me laugh, then she laughs and we're all in a better mood. She knows mom still loves her, and she knows good manners to make me smile and I just want to hug and hug her. Because at the end of the day, when you think about all the things that happened in your day, good or bad, there is really nothing you can do but laugh. And that makes your whole day worth it. You don't have to be laughing at your kids, it can be any relationship with anyone. Maybe it's your relationship with your boyfriend and you've been together for a long time, you're laughing, right ? because honestly, how could you stand to be around a person all the time, and tell them that you love them and whatnot, and yet you never laugh with them ? Do they never make you laugh? it just wouldn't match. Especially if it's someone you love and are with consistently. The good things in life must overcome the bad things. so the more laughs the better. I know parenting is very stressful, especially as a teenage mother. and when she puts that smile on my face, I put my stress aside for this moment and it makes everything better. I want to give an example where laughter really made a difference in my day, if not my entire week. So you know when you have those days when nothing is going right, you argue with your parents or your boyfriend or whoever it is, and you feel like shit all day and week. You haven't laughed, smiled, or done anything funny, because the last couple of days just seem to drag on with the same old routines. Then the weekend rolls around, and I personally find a babysitter, and you're going out with a friend or two. We all get together and start talking about old memories, both good and bad, the ones that embarrass you or the ones that make you want to cry. But then you get to the story that always makes you laugh out loud, if it's told the right way. And you all laugh for hours it seems (but actually it's only been NUM3 minutes). Finally, you are forced to stop laughing because you were laughing so hard that you started to cry. and your stomach hurts like you did fifty crunches, and it hurts so bad, yet you feel so good. The only noise you hear is a small burst of laughter coming out of someone's mouth every thirty seconds or so. So, overall, that's how I see laughter, and why I think it's important in everyone's life. When you are sad, it will make you happy. And when you're stressed, it makes you forget about all the bad and think about the good for a second. When you've had the worst week of your life, it seems like, then you can finally spend your weekend with the girls, and laugh with all your heart, you feel like a new person. Laughter is good for the soul, and it also exercises kind of a muscle in the stomach, I think. No matter who you are or what the problem is, laughter will make you feel better and forget about bad things.
@ LOCATION2 @ LOCATION2 @ CAPS1 wants to travel, and while traveling is fun it's more exciting to go with people you love, but sometimes you go somewhere with people that @ MONTH1 don't know very well. Every two years or so, my @ ORGANIZATION1 choir has the opportunity to travel together. During these trips, students can work with college professors, eat tons of junk food, get away from their parents, and have a great time together. It's an experience every @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS2 dreams of. At the start of my @ CAPS3 year of @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1, my choir director announced that we would have the opportunity to go to @ LOCATION2. I was excited to go, but I'm an extremely introverted person and knew I didn't really have any friends in the choir. I also can't walk and was afraid of being left in a store because I couldn't open the doors or they were crossing a street corner without @ CAPS5 plunging into the street, and thousands of other things that crossed my mind. I was so terrified of being separated from @ PERSON3, my only friend who was in the choir, that I almost didn't go. I don't really know how, but my mom convinced me that everything would be fine and I had nothing to worry about. Once we got to @ LOCATION2, we split into groups to see who wanted to go explore @ PERSON7 and who wanted to walk up @ ORGANIZATION2 Street, one of the windiest roads in the world. My worst nightmare has come true, I have been separated from @ LOCATION3. I tried to tell myself that nothing would go wrong and that the chaperones wouldn't let me out, but in the back of my mind I kept coming to the same conclusion: I would be alone with a bunch of strangers in a town I didn't know anything about. Somehow I got on the bus slowly taking me away from @ LOCATION3. One of the other girls, @ PERSON4, came over to sit next to me and tried to start a conversation. It was one of the longest bus rides of my life. When we got to the bottom of the street @ ORGANIZATION2 we parted again, one group was going to walk to the top of the steep hill and the other was going to climb in one of the old wagons to the top and then go down where the hill was not that steep. I had to go on the cart because the hill was so steep that the sidewalk part contained steps, and since I can't walk the only alternative was the cart. Several of the other children accompanied us and once again @ PERSON4 was in my group. A few hours later, after getting lost and turning several bad streets, we found the tram station and bought our tickets. Luckily I managed to avoid chatting with @ PERSON4 the entire time so the climb up the hill was nice. Some local people smiled at us because we were so excited to get on the cart. We saw houses, shops and @ LOCATION1 on our way. There were six people in our party at the time, two chaperones and four children. Once we got to the top of the hill, two of the kids, @ PERSON6 and @ PERSON5, decided they really needed to go to the bathroom, so one of the chaperones, @ PERSON6 and @ PERSON5 ran down the hill to find a public toilet. This left me, alone, with @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON1, who was the remaining chaperone. We quietly walked down the hill, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON4 doing most of the talking. Every once in a while they would ask me a question and I would respond with as few words as possible, and that's what happened when we walked past a group of men arguing in front of a store and one from them shouted, "@ CAPS4, @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 ! What are you doing ? Are you going to your @ CAPS7 ?" We weren't sure who he was talking to, or what he was talking about, so we kept walking, but as we reached the end of the block, @ PERSON4 and I simultaneously burst out laughing. The man was talking about me. The rest of the descent we started coming up with different weird answers that I should have told the man, each one more hilarious than the last, and as the conversations went on we ended up getting to different topics, which I felt like. did realize that @ PERSON4 and I did have many similar traits. We both loved musicals, we both love to read, and we both have younger, annoying brothers. Since that day @ PERSON4 and I have been quite friends, all because we took a moment to laugh together.
I believe that laughter brings a lot of different people together. In my friendships with friends, we always laugh at the random and silly things that happen to us every day. Laughter is an important part of any friendship or relationship. When laughter helped me the most, it was in fourth grade. The fourth year had brought so many ups and downs that none of us knew it would be. My friends and I had the biggest fight for the smallest reason. This fight included my best friend @ PERSON2, also my neighbor, @ PERSON1, @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON4. We were all very close until this fight which was about my favorite sport, @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2. Everyone had their side, @ PERSON4 sided with @ PERSON2 and I was on my own. @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON3 didn't side with anyone, they just wanted us to get along. It was the hardest for @ DATE2 and I because we were best friends and we did everything together. All of the students in our class knew this and couldn't believe we had a huge argument. @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON1 would do their best to spend time with both of us, but somehow it didn't look like this for @ LOCATION1 and me. We both thought that @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON3 never hung out with us. Soon our teacher and our student teacher called our parents to tell them about this fight. I remember that every other day someone would come home crying. Our parents had a meeting with our teachers and our principal to discuss how they can help us. They concluded with the fact that @ PERSON2, @ PERSON1 and I were going to see a counselor. @ PERSON3 on the other hand went out to see the counselor. We found out when our teacher announced it to the whole class. As @ PERSON1 remembers "It was the first time in a long time that you and @ PERSON2 actually spoke !" @ CAPS3 @ PERSON2 or I remember talking but I guess the change had started to happen. When we went to see the counselor she was very nice and spoke to us in a way that we all felt comfortable with. She asked us what we missed most in our friendship and the three of us responded with a laugh. We said we laugh everyday and now we come home crying. She asked us if we liked to play games during our time together, we said yes. She let us play games, like monopoly, which was really fun. At the end of the day, the three of us returned to class smiling and laughing. When we entered the classroom everyone was surprised that we actually got along. After school I came home and my mom asked me how the counseling session went. I smiled and said we all had fun! The next day, the three of us went back to the counselor and played other games. This session too, we would write an article about how combat has changed us. When we were done writing, we all read the diary to each other. All having the same message : I wish this had never happened, I miss the laughter and I will laugh at this fight in the future. In most cases, this message was very true. @ DATE1, @ PERSON1, @ PERSON2 and I are still best friends. Yes, we tell this story to everyone and laugh every time. Most of the reactions from our friends are shocking as they can't believe we had a fight or they are just laughing at the stupidity of the fight. Most of our friends ask what the moral of the story was and we just say " don't let a little thing get in the way of your friendship and don't forget to laugh at the good times ." In most cases, laughing at this silly fight brought us all closer together and kept us together. Now we have more and more things we can laugh at. Every friendship has its ups and downs and with these comes laughter or crying. At the end of the day, the only way to connect with yourself and your friends is to laugh. Never miss a moment or guess a change with your friends. They will always be with you on the journey of life and laughter is key.
Benefits of Laughter Laughter has always been a big part of my life. when you laugh, you have fun. Having fun puts you in a good mood. When my friends and I get into arguments or disagreements, laughter can be our mediator. Laughter can make a bad situation slightly bearable. Laughter even has great health benefits, like working your heart and lungs. One of my best friend's moms recently passed away just before @ CAPS1. His name was @ CAPS2. She was like a second mother to me for several reasons. I had known her for @ NUM1 years, and for a little while I even lived at her place. She was basically a mother figure to me because I don't live with my birth mother. I saw her almost every day, because of my friend @ PERSON1. He's @ NUM2 and we go out almost every day. I remember the morning he called me and told me that his mother was dead on the floor in her room. I ran there as fast as I could when I saw the lights from the ambulance. My other friend @ PERSON2 spent @ TIME1 at @ PERSON1's house on @ TIME1 his mother is deceased. When I got to @ PERSON1 he immediately started crying on my shoulder. It was wise not to try to make @ PERSON1 happy with laughs, because nothing is really funny when a loved one passes away. Over time, @ PERSON2 and I started to think about ways to boost morale @ LOCATION1. We wanted to make him forget his mother. Didn't you know the best way to do it was to laugh. I am the prankster of my group of friends. So kind of how I have the ability to make people laugh without thinking about it. I am more of a doer than a thinker. I prefer to see my friends in a good mood than in a bad mood. If people are in a bad mood, there is this bad aura or bad mood that you can just feel. It is a very unwanted feeling. Laughter cheers my friends up when they're feeling down. Laughter helped turn a bad situation like the mother of my friends dying into a slightly more comfortable situation. Laughter, trust and respect are @ CAPS3 that brings me and my friends together.
@ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 The first time I heard about sport @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 was the start of my freshman year. I was interested in doing it but I wasn't really sure. Although in eighth grade I played volleyball just for fun and really enjoyed it. I had decided I wanted to play volleyball once I got into high school. But when I entered high school, my opinion of continuing to play on the high school volleyball team changed. I realized it was way more than I expected, the people and attitudes that I realized that if I was to play on the high school volleyball team, I wouldn't have fun. not. So I started to consider joining the @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 team. I had finally decided to register and join the team. I had really hoped to like @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 because it was my first year on the team and I had absolutely no idea what to expect. The first day of training, after school, I went to the girls' locker room, changed and took everything with me and walked out to the hangar on the track. When I went out there I saw a lot of people that I had never seen before except the kids in my class and also my best friend. My coach @ PERSON1 started talking to everyone who didn't know @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1. She told us that it would be a great experience and that it was a great sport and that it was also more of an individual sport than a team sport. But also we did a lot of things as a team. After speaking and discussing the basics of @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1. We have to run our warm-up lap and then stretch as a team. Then we had to start our run for the day and each day was a different training, either road race or track training. I started to really like @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1. At first I was beyond the pain and couldn't move at all. But as the season really started to kick off, I finally got in shape and couldn't wait to train after school every day. We trained and prepared for my first race which made me very nervous. I didn't know what to expect for my first race and was so scared and nervous. But after that, I had run my very first race, I felt good and I was proud of myself. @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 is something I have always loved since my first year when I started running. One of my most favorite races we have ever done was called "@ CAPS5 @ CAPS6" the first time I competed in this race was my first year, it was like our third or fourth races in the season. It was also the first time we had done this race in over two years. So I was excited because I had heard about it and everyone was telling me how exciting it was going to be and that I would love it, on race day I was nervous again like every other race that I was too and still am since I joined @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1. When we got to our destination, we pitched a tent, started warming up for each of the races that were to be going on, a boys 'race and a girls' race. We also hiked the course and that's when I realized what everyone was telling me, mud pits and a huge steep hill and we had to @ CAPS2 a river twice. After the race I had a great time, my team and I laughed and we all had fun. It was so much fun, our team bus rides, all fun practices. As a team, we enjoyed a lot of laughs and all the fun times we had together. My favorite year of @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 should be my first year because it was my best season, I loved it. We have learned to love each other and to form a team. Laughter was a big part of @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 we laughed and enjoyed each other's company as we practiced and also as we made bus rides on the way to our meetings. We had a lot of fun and often laughed as a team and that for me has been a great part of knowing my team and being able to bond and build relationships and friendships with all of my team members. @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 is a sport where laughter is an important part of everyone's running, fun and company, without laughing our team wouldn't be so happy, excited, or even ready to train. Laughter is big in @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 without him our team wouldn't be having as much fun as we have had over the years.
One of the strangest things in life is how people can have different ways of doing things for just about anything. @ CAPS1 what I see the most is laughing. There's that laughter you make when you don't really understand your boss's joke and then there's that laughter you make when it really isn't the "right time." @ CAPS1 one of my favorites is making fun of your best friend when you cry. Sitting on the train a few weeks ago I saw a lady with her friend sobbing about how her boyfriend had just broken up with her. Turning slowly over my shoulder, I try to learn more about the story. Her friend nodded and comforted her. @ CAPS1 then said how disgusting it was when he ate. A bit like a cow eating grass. As soon as her friend said that, the girls' faces flushed and she burst out laughing. @ CAPS1 her eyes were still red as she sniffed a little. @ CAPS1 a slow smile swept across her face. The woman laughed more than she laughed. @ CAPS1 you could tell the girl would be fine because she had someone to make her laugh and remind herself that life is more than just a guy. I thought for a second how this was going more than you might think with my best friend. I feel like even now that seven years have passed, you never get old when you burst out laughing. Most of the time it's something stupid, and we strangely think the same. @ CAPS1 so there are other times when it will be like the lady is behind me. One of us is upset and we know the perfect thing to say to each other. Friendship is like that. And laughter is the cure for any problem. After looking at the two women, I turn in front of me now seeing a teenager and a girl. The girl looks slightly nervous as she continues to smooth her skirt. Then the boy who keeps rocking his knee up and down. And you can tell he's trying to think of something to say as he continues to take sips from his water bottle. The girl finally pointed to the window and said something about playing soccer there when she was little. He looked where she was pointing and said he thought maybe there had been baseball played once. She nodded and they fell silent again. The train came to its next stop jerking a bit, spilling some of its water on his pants. The girl quickly took handkerchiefs out of her purse and gave them to the boy. His cheeks were flushed as he started to chuckle and explain how nervous he was and that wasn't going to help him. The girl looked at him and quickly began to smile. Then they both started to look at each other and laugh. The boys' laughter was deep and echoed in the train, the girls were contagious @ CAPS1 sweet. Now the ice had been broken for an awkward moment and had made them talk and laugh at the same time. It was the start of maybe even a young love. I smiled and rested my head against the window. Watch the trees go by. I knew how our world is always said to be so melancholy @ CAPS1 I think people forget times like this. It's those brief seconds with another human in relation to you. Make you laugh and care enough to try and make you feel better, which keeps our world from going completely crazy. The train slams and begins to slow down when it comes to a stop. I put my bag on my shoulder and get off the train. As I step outside, I feel the cool air kiss my cheeks. I looked around, saw people crowding beside me looking for their next bus or the person to pick them up. I sat on the bench and watched the teenage couple hold hands as they walked past me. As they smile and talk, everything suddenly darkens. I throw my hands up to my eyes, connecting with another big cold hand. I turn to see the person who blinded me. It was my father who was smiling from ear to ear. I got up on the bench and gave him a hug as I started to laugh. My laughter was shrill @ CAPS1 muffled in my father's coat. It was the best kind of laughter for me. No action was funny or a friend would say something @ CAPS1 because you're so happy sometimes you just gotta let out some joy. You're just laughing, not for any reason @ CAPS1 because you're happy. And then in that second, whatever is bad or stressing you goes away. Maybe just for a little while @ CAPS1 is still something that could improve your whole day.
We all know how to laugh now, and we have probably all laughed at least once in our lives. But I've never laughed as hard as the day my friend @ CAPS1 and I were waiting for our friends @ LOCATION1, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON3 to return after asking @ PERSON3 from @ LOCATION3 to hang out for a bit. . @ PERSON1 had to wait at my house for them to come back, on the way home I wonder what the hell am I supposed to do with @ CAPS1 on my own? @ PERSON1 and I always have a lot of fun hanging out with each other but we always have people around when we go out, I anticipated when @ PERSON1 arrived because I couldn't think of what me and @ PERSON1 might do when we were at home without @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON4. We couldn't hang out in the house because my @ CAPS3 had a cold, so we had to go out into the store which is also called a garage, and hang out together until @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON4 got @ NUM1 finally arrived and i wasn't feeling as sick as i thought when she got there she got out of the car and walked in, we went straight to the store and started trying to find something to do, @ PERSON1 suggested that we sat down and just talked I was up for anything as long as it was fun and didn't involve going anywhere at @ NUM2: @ NUM3 @ CAPS4 clock at night. I sat there and asked her if she was happy, did she hate living at @ LOCATION2 and many other things. but then the ultimate topic of conversation came ... TV commercials. we talked about all of our favorite @ CAPS5 ads and why they were our favorites, I told her my all-time favorite ads were the freecreditreport.com ads, the old ones not the new ones, and that the reason I loved them so much was because they had real life situations that made them very easy to believe, but they were also sort of hard to believe because I don't know anyone who had to work in a restaurant disguised as hacker because of identity theft, or someone who had to buy a really dirty car because their credit rating was bad, and I've never heard of a used subcompact? Anyone who @ CAPS1 said their favorite ad was an ad for a car that had dancing hamsters telling you which car would be the best choice, @ CAPS1 was describing the ad to me and started dancing in the middle of my garage. It was quite funny but at the same time somewhat disturbing. @ PERSON1 is a really good friend even if a little awkward at times, but the best thing about having @ CAPS1 is knowing that whenever I need a really good friend I have @ CAPS1 after all the dancing I knew what I wanted while @ CAPS1 was there ... I wanted to be crazy and hyper I wanted to be so full of energy that the fastest runner in the world couldn't keep up with me! I went into the kitchen and drank some sugar and got as hyper as @ CAPS1, only less then time almost passed before we knew it @ PERSON2, @ LOCATION1 and @ PERSON3 were there, we weren't couldn't believe it. @ PERSON3 got out of the car and the first person he hugged was @ PERSON1 of course, then he hugged me, then @ PERSON4, then @ PERSON2. I hadn't seen @ PERSON3 in so long it felt like we had never met before. @ CAPS1 showed everyone their dance and song, everyone laughed so hard I thought they were going to pass out. so what I had in mind at the time @ CAPS1 was a big ball of hyper that night, I thought it was funny. We were right there in the hangar and she goes "smile" and I scream and jump on a chair and scream "@ CAPS14!" @ CAPS1 reassures me he was in the rafters and couldn't come down and grab us, so the rest of the time we just acted like he wasn't even there, I really felt lucky to have @ CAPS1 and I am really happy for the day, I had enough courage to go say hello to him that day in art because other wise people, I will be lost @ PERSON1 is the best friend that a girl could ask for and i was lucky enough to have her for my best friend. She is smart, funny and talented and I would miss her if she had left @ CAPS17 really glad she moved here from port orford.
I live a life full of laughter, I can't think of a day that I haven't laughed. Even when I went to throw the toughest days of my life a bit @ DATE1, there was still someone to make me laugh or a reason to laugh. I think laughter is the best medicine for a person. If you are someone who can have a day without laughing, I would love to meet you and make that change! There are a few special moments that I remember that we were just full of laughs, most of them involving family and friends. The first one I remember is when my parents showed me a picture from when I was a little girl, there were a lot of laughing episodes when it happened to me when I was little. The picture they showed me was at the time of @ DATE2 and I had no shirt on, just shorts. I was sitting on a sled, facing the climb, with the sun shining. I can't explain how my family and I laughed together just looking at a single photo. Another laughing moment that I remember wasn't when it happened, but when I look back now all I can think of to myself is, wow. I was about six @ DATE1 with my best friends who owned eight llamas, who had to be tied in the yard every day. The one I was always able to walk was called @ CAPS1. @ CAPS1 was nice, @ CAPS2 I thought, until one day @ DATE2 she decided to drag me down a freeway. While I was smuggling drugs on a freeway that was usually very busy, all I could here was people screaming " drop it !" " @ CAPS2 me who six years, I thought that if I let go Lama would be hit by a car and would never return. I wished I had let go once an adult got to me because I was all skinned and covered in blisters from the drugs on the sidewalk. It's a time in my life where I'll always look back and laugh, but I'll never forget. The last, my favorite moments in life. It would be pretty much anytime I'm with my boyfriend. Favorite moment was our trip to the beach for the first time. We had never been together but it was amazing! We tried to cycle on the sand, we failed and we laughed about it. Then we decided to walk around all the shops on the beach and see if we could find anything we might have wanted to buy. Later that day we went to the beach, walked and felt amazing. The fun part of this trip was when we were trying to take a picture of ourselves jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People looked at us like we were crazy but, we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost all the time! I think laughing is a very important part of everyday life for everyone. If you don't laugh at least once a day, something is wrong. I love looking at pictures from when I was little, having memories with best friends and their pets like @ CAPS2 like going on trips and just being with my boyfriend. Laughter has helped me a lot in life because it picks me up when I'm feeling down.
Laughter is the frustrating @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2't @ CAPS6 when you can't make someone laugh? @ CAPS6 Is it really possible to be so upset that you can't even smile a little ? There is something to laugh about in every situation, sometimes @ CAPS6 just takes a little thought and imagination to figure out what @ CAPS6 is. I personally had an experience where laughter was all I could look for to feel like everything was okay. Last @ DATE1 I was babysitting, @ CAPS6 was a nice sunny day and we were all craving chocolate ice cubes from @ ORGANIZATION1. At the time, I couldn't legally drive anyone other than my family, so we decided to call my sister, @ LOCATION1. She had a day off so @ CAPS6 seemed like a perfect day for the frostys. We waited what seemed like forever for @ PERSON2 to arrive home and finally after about an hour she pulled into the driveway. The kids were so excited. The four of us loaded in the back of the car @ CAPS4 and went to @ ORGANIZATION1. When we got there we started to get out of the car and that's when I noticed something was wrong. @ PERSON2 had just locked the car keys, the keys still on the ignition and the car moving ! I was still getting the kids out of the car, so you would think I was just going to grab them and grab them, but no, that wasn't the case here. I asked @ PERSON2 "@ CAPS3 did you leave your car running? Aren't you going to collect your keys?" @ CAPS4's response was : "@ CAPS5, no ! I also locked @ CAPS6 ! Don't close your door !" @ CAPS6 was too late. I instinctively closed the door after I finished. I hadn't really thought about how I could have prevented all of this from happening, especially since I was the one who noticed @ CAPS6 first. Apparently I don't listen to people's responses after asking them a question because the kids practically all rolled around on the floor because they were laughing so hard and I couldn't understand what was so funny. Then @ CAPS6 hit me, I felt like an idiot. We were stuck in the parking lot of @ LOCATION2 with three kids, locked outside a moving car and not sure what to do from there. Our first solution to the problem was to call my mom and ask @ CAPS4 to bring in the spare @ CAPS1, but we weren't sure where the spare @ CAPS1 was at the time. My mom said she didn't have @ CAPS6 so we had to call my dad and ask him where @ CAPS6 was. We called him and he laughed at us first because we were so stupid, but then he said @ CAPS1 was in his truck and someone should come and get him @ CAPS6 because he was about to go to a meeting. Obviously we couldn't ask her @ CAPS6, so we called my mom back and she agreed to go get @ CAPS6, although at this point she wasn't too happy to have to quit work to fix our stupidity. . She told us not to worry about the car, nothing was going to happen to @ CAPS6 with @ CAPS6 locked, and just go inside @ PERSON1 and grab our frostys. Through it all, @ PERSON2 and I were just trying to keep the kids entertained, but they didn't really need us for that. They were too busy playing the part of closing the door for me when @ PERSON2 said not to. They thought @ CAPS6 was hilarious. @ PERSON2 and I weren't so amused by @ CAPS6, although we thought @ CAPS6 was quite funny to see them overdo it over and over again. Instead of making the children laugh, they made us laugh. We sat at @ LOCATION2 for almost two hours before my mom showed up with @ CAPS1. @ CAPS6 turned out that @ CAPS1 was not in my father's truck as we thought, @ CAPS6 was in our house, hanging on the board with all the other spare keys. It didn't matter though, all that mattered was that we got the kids home before their mother showed up with us there. The car sitting there consuming gasoline with no one in the car was not the fun part of the day, and @ PERSON2 also didn't blame me for everything and had me fill the tank @ CAPS4 with all the money. that I had earned that day by babysitting. The fun part was the kids. Even today, they laugh at the adventure of our little @ PERSON1. @ CAPS6 just makes me realize that @ CAPS6 is all the kids who make everyone laugh and encourage happiness in everyone. I think everyone needs a bit of a laugh in their day, even if they think @ CAPS6 is the worst day ever. Laughter really is @ CAPS1.
Laughter plays an important role in building friendships, relationships and partnerships. Laughing is the first thing you learn to do, you were born knowing how to laugh, it's the only thing you were born to know how to do. Laughter for me is what starts a friendship if I can make someone laugh, we're already closer than when we first said "@ CAPS1". For example, when I started working at the daycare where I am now, when I made other teachers laugh, you can just say that it is a way of excluding yourself as a member of the team. On the first day of work, I entered the nervous daycare, they sent me to the preschool class. I'm pretty sure my boss could tell I was nervous and it made me laugh. It made me feel welcome to be there and like we could be friends. The kids in this classroom made me laugh at what they did. By working well with children you find out if you can make them laugh or laugh at their jokes, they are more inclined to trust you and with that you can make them feel comfortable around you. Having someone's trust is sometimes hard to get, but if you get it early on, it's easy to keep but also very easy to lose. When someone is in the trash, just making them laugh can make everything better. Laughter is like a medicine that makes you feel better when nothing else can. It's safe to say that making people laugh is natural because I'm just good at it and jokes come easy. When you laugh, everything gets better. Laughter is in fact health and is a form of excursion. When I'm at work and the kids are laughing, I feel better even though I'm having the worst day of my life. When I'm around happy people, I feel a lot better about myself. It's even better when her babies are laughing because they are so cute when they do.
Laughs, @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 on a @ CAPS3 @ DATE1 @ CAPS4 One of my favorite traditions of @ DATE1 is visiting our @ CAPS2's house, the @ CAPS5. They live on eighty acres of forests and meadows outside a quaint old town. Their little green house overlooks brown fields and a blue pond, with tall trees forming a backdrop. We arrive in the middle of the morning. Either we find our @ CAPS2s in the house or we meet them coming out of the woods to meet us, shovels, chainsaws and other trail building tools in their hands. After the customary hello, how are you, we often wander the yard, exclaiming in front of new fruit trees or listening to stories about the last tenants of the nest boxes. During the hottest part of @ CAPS4, we make our way to the shade of the lush woods of @ ORGANIZATION1. A short walk will bring us to a trail. I love to walk among sun-streaked ferns and fallen logs, tread cautiously on rickety bridges over bubbling streams, confidently bounce on sturdy new bridges, and try to avoid dogs as they gallop in and out. some water. @ PERSON2 knows all about the flora and fauna of the region, so we get a constant flow of knowledge during our hikes. He also has, of course, to tell us about the trees he planted - a redwood here (look how good! A foot since last fall!) And a Douglas fir there (not so good. This big one. redwood shades too). One of the best parts of the hike is when we see the dead end section of the trail my family helped build three years ago. We still walk all the way to the end and discuss where it could go from there - over the creek or next to it, or up the hill and if so where would the switchbacks be ? could you really ride a bike on a trail like this? After our walk, we arrive home, sweaty and chatty. Then it's time to put on the swimsuits and jump in the pond! They recently built a dock that we can jump from - a big improvement over wading in from the edge. We swim for most of @ TIME1, running across the pond, splashing on inner tubes, having pondweed throwing battles. Finally, we tire and sit by the pond, drying ourselves in the hot sun. At @ TIME1, dinner is ready. Laura typically cooks salmon, accompanied by a plethora of delicious side dishes. We drag chairs up the hill above the pond and enjoy a leisurely supper. From the hill we can see turtles and birds on the pond, insects above the fields and other birds diving in the air feasting on the aforementioned bugs. After the meal, we bring the chairs and dishes home and sit on the porch in @ TIME2. @ PERSON2's favorite part of @ CAPS4 is at dusk, when the sun is at the right angle to show all the bugs swirling in the air. At one point all the bugs come together and create a tornado, twisting upward in the darkening sky, then - they are gone, until the next @ CAPS4. It's an incredible sight; thousands of tiny insects disappear all at once. The best thing about these days is the friendship and camaraderie we have with this wonderful family. Parents knew each other long before our children were born, so we have a lot to tell each other; @ PERSON2 is very interested in science subjects, and he always finds a way to bring up the last article he read. And, as with all @ CAPS2 greats, we laugh all the time. I constantly hiccup at least three times just when we lounge on the porch after our busy @ CAPS4. Even on the most serious of matters my dad or the boys at @ PERSON1 may come up with a joke, usually "politically incorrect" but still very funny. Now don't even get me started on the @ DATE1 camping trips, winter ski trips, or fall cider pressing we do with the @ CAPS5.
Misunderstood "@ CAPS1 the devil is his problem", @ CAPS1 I thought as I glanced over and @ CAPS7 gave me a mean look @ CAPS15. @ CAPS27 obviously thought the new girl was weird. @ CAPS7 @ CAPS24 had a killer look @ CAPS15 in his eyes. I observed the way @ CAPS7 looked @ CAPS27 around the room and how his facial expression never changed. “@ CAPS2 eh,” asked my cousin, @ PERSON1, looking at @ CAPS3, who was, of course, the new girl. I took a look at @ CAPS3, then @ LOCATION1. "@ CAPS5 on ! @ CAPS11 can say @ CAPS26 ! @ CAPS7 can't hear us," @ CAPS7 whispered. @ PERSON1's whispers weren't as quiet as @ CAPS7 thought. @ CAPS3 could probably hear everything we were saying. I glanced at him again and noticed that behind those cold eyes @ CAPS7 looked a bit lonely and sad. Guess @ CAPS26 is possible, @ CAPS7 has been talking about the whole @ NUM1 class since @ CAPS7 arrived about @ NUM2 days ago. "Hello @ CAPS6 ! Taylor ? Is @ CAPS11 here ?" @ CAPS7 was now in my face and my sight on @ CAPS3. "@ CAPS7 looks like @ CAPS2 on the outside, but maybe @ CAPS7 is actually a nice person," I said @ CAPS1, but knew @ CAPS15 would not satisfy @ PERSON1 at all. "@ CAPS1? Certainly not. His parents are probably from a Mafia or something. @ CAPS7 has that kind of aura." "@ CAPS11 shouldn't judge anyone @ CAPS31 by their appearance," I replied. @ PERSON1 gave me @ CAPS15 kind of confusing look. "I mean, @ CAPS11 never knows unless @ CAPS11 asks for it." "@ CAPS12 if you are an expert on @ CAPS26, why not @ CAPS11 go and sit with her at lunch and ask her." @ CAPS13 man. There was @ CAPS29 way I could possibly do this. I know @ CAPS24 said don't judge someone @ CAPS31 how they look, but @ CAPS7 makes it look like if I even open my mouth to talk to him @ CAPS7 will kick me in the shins. @ CAPS1 a difficult situation @ CAPS15 is. "@ CAPS14 isn't @ CAPS11 the one who wants to get to know him? @ CAPS11 asks." @ CAPS15, we will not pass @ CAPS31 after @ PERSON1 either. “@ CAPS16? @ CAPS29 way. We've already decided that @ CAPS11 is going to ask. @ CAPS11 can't @ CAPS5 come back with the same,” @ CAPS7 argued. @ PERSON1 is a very stubborn girl, and although @ CAPS7 likes to pick on me, @ CAPS7 is a really nice person. Also, despite his obnoxious exterior, @ CAPS7 has a lot of friends, unlike me who is shy. “@ CAPS17,” I mumbled. I had to give in. @ CAPS29 account @ CAPS1 I say I'm going to have to face @ CAPS3. "It's @ CAPS1 I thought. @ CAPS26 is a great opportunity to make a new friend. I'm @ CAPS24 helping @ CAPS11." @ CAPS7 had @ CAPS15 a mischievous smile on his face. I took one last look at @ CAPS3 one last time and then at the clock. @ CAPS26 was @ NUM3 in the morning, about a minute or two since I'm nearsighted, but lunch is at @ NUM4. I couldn't pay attention at all during class. I was too busy playing out possible scenes that might happen at lunch. Maybe @ CAPS7 isn't mean, maybe @ CAPS7 is really cool, and people don't understand @ CAPS24, including me. Other than that, I don't even know @ CAPS1 to say; I can't @ CAPS24 casually walk around, sit in front of her, look her in the eye, smile and say "@ CAPS21. How's @ CAPS11 ?" The impossible is @ CAPS24 impossible and people should @ CAPS24 except @ CAPS26, in fact @ CAPS26 should actually be a basic law. I looked at the clock again, @ CAPS26 was now @ NUM5 and still working. “@ NUM6 minutes,” @ PERSON1 said in a singing tone. I sighed. "@ CAPS22? I kept looking @ CAPS11 during class. It looked like @ CAPS11 was going to jump out that window and run away at any time." @ CAPS7 laughed. My seat was @ CAPS31 the window, and that option had not escaped my notice. "I have the index @ CAPS29 @ CAPS1 I'm going to say," I finally said. “@ CAPS24 says anything that won't offend him. Ask about his hobbies or @ CAPS1 @ CAPS7's likes. Even talk about school,” @ CAPS7 replied. "It's @ CAPS26 time. Go ahead." @ CAPS27 has piled up outside the classroom and into the cafeteria. After having lunch, I started to walk to the table where @ CAPS3 was ; @ CAPS29 one was around her, @ CAPS29 surprise over there. "@ CAPS6, @ MONTH1 I'm sitting here," I asked. My voice was a little shaky and I thought I was about to have a heart attack from nervousness and surprise @ CAPS1 @ CAPS7 said. “@ CAPS31, everything is fine, go ahead,” @ CAPS7 smiled. Wow, @ CAPS7 is really cute when @ CAPS7 is smiling. I smiled back at him and sat down. I created a @ CAPS31 conversation by introducing myself and asking how @ CAPS7 was and how @ CAPS7 liked the @ CAPS15 school. To my surprise, we shared a common interest and were connected. @ CAPS7 was laughing. I was joking. We laughed together. After that day, and still today, we are the best friends in the world. This slight feeling of laughter is @ CAPS24 so nostalgic, @ CAPS26 is almost indescribable. @ CAPS24 something so minor as a laugh, or even a small laugh, can bring anyone together to form a simple bond, a friendship. Laughter is truly an essential part of life.
It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold this knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at some point in our lives, whether in a group of people, or just laughing and hanging out @ CAPS9. The reality is that we are all connected to each other in a very simple way, we have all laughed in our lives. Laughter for everyone means something different. For @ CAPS15 laughing can mean I'm happy and full of life and other times it can just mean feeling like I really don't know how to @ CAPS22. There was once, however, that it meant both. It was a cold and rainy day from @ DATE1 to @ DATE2. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends it usually means we're talking about the last thing, guys, hair, and everything in between. "@ CAPS1 my God @ PERSON3 !" We heard @ PERSON2 screaming as @ PERSON1 and I walked into my room. "@ CAPS1 boy." I thought, "@ CAPS3 we @ CAPS7 again. I knew it would be a mistake to have both @ CAPS3 at the same time." @ PERSON1 and I exchanged looks, I knew she had the same thought going through @ CAPS28's head. "@ CAPS4, @ CAPS22 happened this time ?" @ PERSON1 sighed as we walked into the room to see them both fight, pulling their hair hard, slapping each other, @ CAPS29 did everything imaginable for each other before I did. lose. I hate seeing my @ CAPS7 friends against each other like @ CAPS29. "@ CAPS4 !" I finally cry. "@ CAPS3's @ CAPS22 we're going to do. You," I pointed to @ PERSON3, "@ CAPS7 and sit there." @ PERSON3 came out of my room and sat down. "@ CAPS4, @ CAPS9. @ CAPS14 Can't you just relax and enjoy this moment and act like you're friends? For at least six more hours?" I looked at each of them, @ CAPS29 nodded in response. "@ CAPS9, @ CAPS14 allows @ CAPS7 to finish the rest of this movie or play a quiet game." I sighed, hoping the worst was over. @ PERSON3 went back to my room and lay down on my bed, we continued the movie peacefully. "@ CAPS10't @ CAPS11 @ CAPS12 just a comedic genius ?" @ PERSON2 said looking at the screen. We started laughing at @ CAPS28 because @ CAPS28's eyes seemed to be on him only. "@ CAPS1 my God @ PERSON2 !" @ PERSON3 said with a laugh. "@ CAPS14 who is calling who crazy ?" @ CAPS15 and @ PERSON1 both looked at each other and started giggling. The tension in the air was almost too thick. @ PERSON2 had on @ CAPS28 game face for this comment. I leaned over to @ PERSON1 and whispered, "@ CAPS1 this isn't going to be pretty." We started to prepare for the worst. "@ CAPS17 grab @ PERSON3's arm and slide @ CAPS28 out of this room if you have to." @ PERSON1 jumped to @ CAPS28 feet and pulled @ PERSON3 out of the room, with just enough time for @ CAPS15 to pin @ LOCATION1 to my bed. When @ CAPS29 was gone and the door was closed, I let @ CAPS28 stand up but kept between @ CAPS28 and the door. "@ CAPS4, @ CAPS22 happening with you two ?" I nervously asked @ CAPS28. @ PERSON2 started laughing at some sort of nasty sneer that sent chills down my spine. I couldn't help but give a scared little laugh, which only further influenced the situation. It could only mean one thing, my original intention, not to invite any of them, had just been confirmed, we were there. I slowly started backing up and walked out of my room to see @ CAPS22 @ PERSON3 had to say, as I never got anything from @ LOCATION1. I inhaled and walked over to them in the hallway. "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS22 going on? You've never had such an intense argument before." @ CAPS20 started to flow down @ CAPS28's cheeks, like a stream flowing steadily down a hill. "I ... I don't know @ CAPS22h ... it's over." @ PERSON3 still says crying. "I just wanted to… ask @ CAPS28 @ CAPS22 ha… it happened today." The faces of @ CAPS21 and @ PERSON1 just looked like, @ CAPS22 happened that we missed. "@ CAPS22 did you mean when you said @ CAPS22 happened today ?" I asked. I was at a loss for words when she gave the answer @ CAPS15 @ CAPS28. "@ CAPS23 is that all that happened? You two were going to tear your hair out for some guy?" @ PERSON3 looked @ CAPS15 and just said yes. "@ CAPS4 enters @ CAPS3." The three of us went inside. I sat on the bed next to @ LOCATION1, @ PERSON1 was in the middle protecting @ PERSON3. "@ CAPS4, it's pointless. @ CAPS23 you both like the same guy. That's a big deal! @ CAPS29 only complicates things anyway." I looked at them both, @ CAPS20 running down both rosy cheeks. "@ CAPS14 can we just forgive and forget ?" @ CAPS27 filled the room. @ PERSON3 crawled, the metal bed frame creaking as she did. "I'm sorry @ CAPS23, @ PERSON2. Can you forgive @ CAPS15 ?" @ CAPS28 tear stained face and red eyes, @ PERSON2 was @ CAPS17 to respond. "Of course I forgive you." @ CAPS29 hugged with @ CAPS20 continuing to trickle down their faces. Everything was fine again.
