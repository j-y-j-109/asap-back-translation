Laughter is one of the most important things in life. If you are depressed, a smile or a laugh causes your body to send messages throughout your body to make you feel better. Scientists also say it takes more muscles to frown than to smile. I believe this is true, because in order to frown you have to make your whole body look like it is frowning like your shoulders and face, but only a small smile shows people that you are happy. In this way, my family is extremely beneficial to each other. Every day when we have a conversation, someone brings up a recalled story or movie quote and says it out loud to everyone with the right accent to make it look exactly like the movie and make everyone laugh. the world . For example, every once in a while my brother or sister will bring up a quote from @ PERSON1 or @ PERSON2, two comedians that we really love to listen to, and every person in the room would jump in with some hilarious quotes they were saying and that might be fine. All night long. Or, not long ago my favorite movie was Get @ CAPS1 because it was quite entertaining so we would have rampages over supper or just random in the kitchen citing this movie for at least half an hour and the room would be filled with no-stop laughing. On the other hand, someone will randomly comment because they misheard or just don't understand. Like when we had dinner at my place. My family and our guests were sitting at the table and had just finished eating when we brought up the topic of @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 because my little sister was teaching them at school. We verbally ended the train of "Who @ CAPS4 ruled @ CAPS5, who they were from, and @ CAPS5 they were other names". But according to my little sister, we missed one. So out of the blue comes "@ CAPS5 about @ CAPS6 ?!". Her intentions were with @ CAPS4, but I believe everyone in the room heard “@ CAPS5 about @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 ?!”, until we stopped for a second and dealt with @ CAPS5 that she meant, and we all laughed and she had no idea why until she stopped thinking about it herself. Our family has a great time full of laughs and jokes, but there are also some very depressing times. About four years ago, an incident happened with my neighbor next door who brutally assaulted him and died on our doorstep. He was very dear to my family and the rest of the cul-de-sac we live in, and his death like that was extremely unexpected and terrible to wake up in the middle of the night. After that there was a period of little laughter and fun as we were all haunted by this horror. But, we all knew his spirit was there to protect us, and so whenever we thought about it, there was a gap between mourning his loss, only to be filled with happiness and laughter. I believe that my family and I have a very close bond between us, because we are so funny. There is never stress between us, but always a calm feeling of familiarity and complicity. Someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I believe whoever that person is, is right. Even between two strangers meeting on the street, if they stop and have a conversation, and one person makes a joke that makes them both laugh, that's the spark of an immediate connection, and they could become friends for a long time. It is one of the most important values that people have, and most people are unaware of how much it really matters to mankind.

 The human brain is a job. It is the realm of our lives. It infuriates us, guides us, helps us and destroys us. Our brain can make our body feel whatever it wants. It is really something else. One of the most valuable things the brain is capable of is a sense of humor. To laugh. The ability not to take life seriously for a moment. That light switch in the body @ CAPS7 that causes the brain @ CAPS7 to reach a state of uncontrollable happiness. Laughter is the only way our brain can cope with the world. Discover the funny events that life has to offer. Personally, I am one of those people who finds life funny, or who will find a way to make it funny. I hardly ever get serious or take things seriously. The same with my friends, we are always the ones who have a good time because we make life interesting. Maybe it's our gnarled facial expressions that we're swapping, or we @ MONTH1 are just funny. Either way, we have a good sense of humor. This is life @ CAPS4, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS7 happiness with people who fill life @ CAPS7 with joy. @ PERSON1 said, “ just live, so that others can just live ”. I @ CAPS9, we can all with a little humor. Last year a few friends and I went to Mission Ridge for a weekend to snowboard. We made it our own hotel suite with two king beds and a @ CAPS2 plasma screen. @ PERSON2 and I slept on one bed and @ PERSON3 on the other. We all always got along perfectly and shared the biggest laughs together. Nothing could come between us. Apart from a little midnight farce. The second night at the hotel, @ PERSON3 fell asleep first. @ PERSON2 and I were watching a ghost movie that bored us to tears. @ PERSON2 was eating a bag of popcorn and started throwing small pieces of kettle at @ LOCATION1, trying to wake him up. "@ CAPS3, I have the funniest idea." @ PERSON2 whispered to me. "@ CAPS4 ?" I replied lazily. Without a word, @ PERSON2 jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom. She came back with a tube of @ ORGANIZATION2 toothpaste, a bag of coins, and a pack of peach washers. "I have nothing to do with it." I say, continuing to stare at the television. @ PERSON2 started squirting toothpaste on @ PERSON3's arms, she ran the creamy solution down her legs, up her face and into her hair. She stuck quarters, dimes and pennies in the mint cement, as well as the sweet peach rings. "@ CAPS5 will kill you." I gasped. "@ CAPS6 @ CAPS5 won't do it ! It will be hilarious." @ PERSON2 blurted out then fell back on the hotel bed, admiring his work. @ PERSON2 then picked up his bag of popcorn and started throwing kettle pieces in @ LOCATION1's face again. The next morning it was not as expected by @ PERSON2. @ PERSON3 woke up well, but didn't have the look on his face that @ PERSON2 wanted. "@ CAPS7 made for @ PERSON2 !" @ PERSON3 shouted. @ PERSON2 smiled, still convinced it was just a joke. I saw the fury in @ LOCATION1's eyes. @ CAPS5 was beyond anger. Her body was covered with dried toothpaste. Coins and dimes and pennies pierced his skin and peach rings hung from his moldy legs. @ PERSON3 rushed into the bathroom to look at himself in the mirror. @ CAPS5 burst into the room with a bottle of shampoo clutched in his hand. @ PERSON2 turned to him and his smile disintegrated. "@ CAPS4 are you going to do with that bottle of shampoo?" @ PERSON2 questioned, confused. @ PERSON3 moved closer to @ PERSON2, she backed up slowly, not quite sure @ CAPS4 were her intentions. They both changed positions, her back now facing the door and @ PERSON3 across the room by the window. @ PERSON3 lifted the shampoo bottle above his head. "@ CAPS9 fast." @ PERSON3 screamed and threw the bottle as hard as @ CAPS5 could in @ ORGANIZATION1's face. But unfortunately @ PERSON2 slipped out just in time for the bottle to miss her face and create a nuclear explosion on the door behind her. Blue liquid spat all over the walls. There was a recess from where the bottle hit the door. @ PERSON2's entire back was covered in blue mud. I jumped out of bed and ran to the entrance where the explosion took place. @ PERSON3 reached @ PERSON2 and immediately burst out laughing. @ PERSON2 sat down in a puddle of shampoo and burst out laughing. I stood there smiling at them. @ PERSON3 still covered in a crust, @ PERSON2 covered in blue goop that looked like someone threw up a blueberry smoothie on their back. I sat down with them, we all looked at each other without a word. everything was fine. It occurred to me then that @ CAPS6 mattered @ CAPS4 that we engage, that we try to blow each other up, we will always find a way to laugh about it. The sense of humor is just that our souls tell us that everything will be fine. It is this value in life that we can cherish forever.

 It was my thirteenth birthday. I woke up on a sunny day which was weird for @ ORGANIZATION1 since it was late @ DATE1. I got up excitedly. I ran to the kitchen where my parents were. My dad asked me if I wanted to go work with him and I said yes. My father is a roofer, so I couldn't get on the houses because I was too young. I had to stay at the bottom and pick up the trash they threw. I was doing this for a while, then I got my soccer ball out of my dad's truck and started running around kicking the ball around. As I was running I noticed this slippery place. I had in mind not to go but forgot and walked on the slippery place. I fell, but as I was falling I kicked the soccer ball and it hit the wall and came back and hit me in the face. My father and uncles laughed heartily as I grew flushed and embarrassed. They were telling me how funny it would be if it was in slow motion. I was so embarrassed that I put the ball back in my dad's truck and went back to work. The sun was setting and we were on our way home. we got to my house and i walk over to the house door and open it and hear "@ CAPS1!" @ CAPS2 I looked around and my friends and family were there. the reason my dad took me to work was because my mom was going to throw me a party @ CAPS1. I will say hello to my family and friends. Then I went to take a shower, I was in the shower putting on soap when all of a sudden the lights went out. I got scared and screamed as loud as I could. I ran out of the bathroom. I went into the living room and the lights come back on. My family and friends looked at me and started to laugh. In my head, I wonder why they are laughing at me? I looked down and I'm naked. Everyone was laughing and enjoying the moment, as I turned red and about to cry. I ran to my room, I put on some clothes. I returned to the living room and enjoyed my party.

 What would you do in a world with the laughter of @ CAPS4 ? Every day everyone smiles or laughs. It makes a person feel better. Laughter is a healthy drug that affects you and others for the better. There are many times in my life when all I needed was a laugh. All I wanted was to have someone to make me smile and cheer me up. I have an example. I just moved again, this was my high school @ NUM1. I felt totally alone, I didn't know anyone and no one was there to help me feel less alone. I wanted a friendly face to smile or talk to me. The whole @ NUM2 hours at this new school were appalling. While waiting for my mom to pick me up, I hated my new life here. "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 they spoke to me on the first day, then @ CAPS4 they will speak to me at all" is what came to my mind. I remembered every day after school we would come home with my group of friends, we would all tease each other or just say something stupid. We were always laughing and rejoicing. As I sat there waiting for my mother, I heard my name called by a familiar voice. Looking up, I found my friends @ PERSON5, @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 poking their heads out of my mom's car window, waving to me. Seeing how school had barely come out, there were still tons of teens @ NUM3, @ PERSON2, @ PERSON6 !! "I exclaimed. My unhappy thoughts were gone and I was smiling. I could smell. people watch me as my friends got out of the car to hug me. For some reason I didn't care that I could smile again and be really happy with my closest friends. I grabbed my purse and I ran over to hug them all. They missed two lessons to pick me up from school. My mom told them how miserable I was and needed help. 'a friendly face. She couldn't have been more right. After hugs, smiles and laughs were exchanged my friend @ PERSON5 said her classic line. "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ PERSON3?" @ CAPS4 we could to stop laughing, even my mom broke a smile. As I got in the car, I forgot about my bad day and how felt awful. I forgot how much I wanted my friends there to make me feel. When they arrived I couldn't have been happier. My life is great, school afterwards was great. I made good friends there because my three buddies reminded me of who I was and pushed me to be myself. They made me laugh and when I smiled at my new high school people were more open and welcoming to me. Soon after, @ PERSON4 was able to go to school smiling and laughing every day. Friends are a big influence in your life, they remind you to smile and laugh. Laughter is the truth between happiness I should say. It was because of me smiling and laughing that I made new friends and had another great life in high school. Laughter brought me people because it made me feel like a nice, fun person that I am. I see laughter being the remedy for all misfortunes.

@ PERSON1 laughing Once upon a time there was a girl called @ PERSON1. The year was two thousand forty eight and there were only a few people alive after @ DATE1, it's @ CAPS7 the end of the world. @ PERSON1 @ PERSON2's friend was a huge @ CAPS1 freak. She would make funny videos herself and put them on @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. One day she was so bored that she went to sit in front of her computer camera and made an I'm a @ ORGANIZATION1 "video. It was the funniest thing @ PERSON1 had ever seen. She wore a @ ORGANIZATION1 hat that was part of the @ CAPS1 uniform and wore a @ CAPS1 shirt with some of the famous characters. @ PERSON2 was singing, "I'm an @ ORGANIZATION1. I'm a bit @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1. I crawl in the garden, catching a mouse, a mouse. I'll move my tongue to taste you. "@ CAPS7 she was done, she posted it on the website. @ PERSON1 showed all of their friends how epic this video was, @ PERSON2 of course loved it, as did @ PERSON 1. Once the video wasn't so cool or funny anymore which took about two point five days nobody really looked at it and nobody really laughed about it, which was done for that purpose. But @ CAPS7 someone would watch it for the first time they went to school, giggled and felt silly because everyone had already looked at it, and they didn't think it was funny anymore. who was really stuck was @ ORGANIZATION1. Everyone in the group of friends of @ LOCATION1 and @ ORGANIZATION2 all laughed and @ CAPS7 @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2 didn't laugh, their friends called them losers because they weren't making fun of the child who was being teased. @ CAPS7 someone being teased is no fun. son why people laugh and put others down is because they are not sure of themselves and it is not about laughing. The folks at @ CAPS7 are watching @ PERSON2's video saying she was an @ ORGANIZATION1, which was made to make people laugh and to think it was funny, @ CAPS8 didn't use the bad words that people say to put others down. Laughter is a key part of a conversation, but laughing is also healthy for people. @ CAPS7 others see that people are laughing at them, now is not the time to make fun of them, it is @ MONTH1 to be funny in some cases but, put yourself in that person's shoes, feel what she feels @ CAPS7 people say rude and hurtful things, people could stop people throwing down badmouths and standing up for hurt people. Laughter was made for things that are really funny. Suppose you are walking down the street, on a sidewalk, and you pass these punk kids who think they are the diggity bown, and they bite sticks and throw bottles and trash at a homeless man with his dog, while the man is lit the ground in pain of those kids kicking him where he can't move, are you just going to walk by and laugh because you think it's funny? No @ CAPS2 no, @ CAPS2 is going to walk or run to the poor man and see if he's oak, then you can call the police and see if they can find the kids who did that to that poor old man. To see people laugh who are depressed over words or get beaten up is not fair and people have to stop, it is a world where if you are the last people on the planet, and they know that you laugh at other people's pain, do you really think they'll help you, or just walk past and laugh like you did ? People are cruel in this world and we all need someone who will help us if we are hurt or downcast because of hurtful words. One way that you benefit from laughter is that you feel good, and you have people who will help you when needed, if you laugh at the right things. Tell the friends at @ CAPS2 that if they laugh at people's pain and anger, that one of these days no one will be there to stand up for them. You could be the change we have in schools, in the work environment, in life in general, be the change for the children and grandchildren of @ CAPS2, for the future friends of @ CAPS2, for the world future."

 When you look back it all seems to have a deeper meaning. However, as we get older we see the world with new eyes. We see the truth, hard, stripped of the frozen film that hid it. Laughter helps us to see the joy again, to remember that it is there. When was the last time you got lost in laughter ? Studies have shown that laughter releases beneficial chemicals in the body. It can add years to a lifetime because, believe it or not, our bodies love to be happy. Laughter is a highly addictive and contagious drug and the best part is, it's free, legal, and healthy! Laughter makes us feel better when needed and brings us closer. Throughout everything that goes on in our lives, laughter is one of the only things that can distract us from pain and stress. As life becomes more and more complicated as we age, we find that laughter is harder to find, but no less necessary. I remember a time when I was excited to go to school every day. I loved coming into the familiar classroom and seeing all of the people who made my days brighter. We would tell jokes and bring back good memories and in doing so, we would create new ones for the future. Life was simpler, the worst of our worries was the desperation of growing old, losing our youth and breaking out of the helpless shells in which we were trapped. From us alone knew what it really meant. Smiles weren't hard to come by and we all enjoyed the simplicity our lives had to offer. Through all the memories and the laughs, I began to realize that love exists outside of movies and family, the love you find for a friend you cherish. Laughter was the key variable, revealed in understanding my relationships. As you learn to fall deeply in love as a child, this patience and confidence can help you get through each day for the rest of your life. All we need to do is remember not to forget. The simplicity of childhood is what makes her so precious. Sadly, as we age, the future hangs over our heads, casting a shadow over the things we hold dear. There is a predetermined way of living our life that for some reason erases the plausibility of our true aspirations. Laughter gives way to sighs and tears as dimples are forgotten and replaced by furrowed brows. In adulthood, everything revolves around the office and is held to a grade nine to five. Businessmen walk past them, looking like identical blind penguins. Where did all the fun go? It seems that the fun is evaporating day by day. We no longer get to know our colleagues around a circle of carpet squares. Instead, we're confined to our felt paddock and swivel chair. All the stress makes us forget to laugh, but we just can't forget. Laughter is the amnesia that makes the cabin a fort and the chair a rocket that will take us from our fort to follow our dreams. So when was the last time you got lost in laughter ? Do it now. Take the pen and turn it into a nib. Step out of your cabin and find the world you like. Laugh everyday because life is too short to forget.

 It all started with a book @ DATE1 @ DATE1 ago. My mom noticed that I was having a hard time finding friends, so she decided to help me make them. She had a few friends from school who had children of their own, some my age. I had known these girls a few times when I was a child, but not recently. I don't know today what my mom saw in @ LOCATION1 that made her think we were going to click, but she was right. What seemed like such a small action would drastically change my life. At @ DATE2, in my new home, I first met @ PERSON1. That night before she arrived, I couldn't help but be very angry with my mom for doing this. I felt good and quite capable of making friends on my own. She acted like she knew me, but the few things I had that she didn't believe would be good for me. I didn't think she could be right this time and I didn't want to waste my time. A sudden knock on the door interrupted my train of thought, I could hear her muffled voices and footsteps below. Quickly, I retired to my room and onto my bed. The bulky front door opened and closed, followed by footsteps coming up to my room. When @ PERSON1 first walked into my room, I initially thought there was no way we were getting along. She was a gorgeous blonde girl, visibly popular and very confident. I couldn't help but think that she was going to call me a freak and point out my differences like the other girls in school did. "@ CAPS1, what are you reading ?" @ PERSON1 asked as she sat on my bed. Come and find it for yourself. I replied, offering him the book in my hands. I knew she would hate this book. He was talking about all the microorganisms that live and feed on your body. I was right and as she leaned over cautiously @ PERSON1 read the book with a disgusted look on her face. Laughter was bubbling inside me, I couldn't hold it back any longer. My dull little room was buzzing with my laughter. @ PERSON1 looked at me with another weird look on his face and started laughing with me. Once the laughter stopped and the ice was broken, we started talking about other interests. @ DATE1 short hours went by and we found a lot of things we had in common. We shared funny stories, presented new music and talked about hobbies. I couldn't remember the last time I felt so in tune with someone, especially someone I had just met! Suddenly our conversation was interrupted by a quick knock on the door downstairs, we looked at each other and smiled. In this smile, I saw a real father smile at me with real pleasure to show through. Very different from previous encounters with children at school. Downstairs, we said goodbye to each other. As the new fresh air @ DATE3 began to rush through the open door, I reached out to give her a hug. To my surprise, she took my gesture and ran to give me a hug. Her hair smelled of hair products and powder, a very unfamiliar but surprisingly heartwarming scent. After she was gone for the night, I started to think. I really liked @ PERSON1 and wanted to see her again soon. I felt somewhat accomplished and fulfilled to have this brilliant future opportunity presented to me so easily and perfectly. Guilt also hit me when I realized how I felt about @ PERSON1 at first. For someone who had been judged for most of school, I had been very hypocritical. That night I stayed up later than usual thinking about the next time I could see her, what she had looked like and tried to figure out how we could get along so well. Despite these questions haunting my every thought, I slept happily, thinking about the next time I would see her. All of these questions and concerns from @ DATE1 were answered in @ DATE1, and we are closest friends. Soon after we started dating more often, we started to like each other very much. One of my favorite parts of our relationship is how people are so confused to see us two different people so close to each other. We can take the looks, the comments, and whatever else we're struggling with today and find a way to laugh together to make it less important. I thanked my mom over these @ DATE1 for a lot of things, but mostly for what she's done for my relationship. Without her my life would probably have been a lot darker. No one on that cold night expected this meeting to turn into our beautiful relationship. Laughter is an extremely vital part of a relationship, whether it's built or nurtured. Thanks to the laughter excelling in the conversation @ DATE1 @ DATE1 ago, I had the best experience I could ever ask for.

  As I was a little girl, I lived without my biological mother, @ CAPS1 abandoned me for an adaptation while @ CAPS1 was only @ NUM1, @ CAPS1 was not ready @ CAPS8 to be a mother. @ CAPS1 has always taken risks and has never thought about its consequences. My adoptive parents have always been @ CAPS4 honest with me about her and why @ CAPS1 abandoned me. I accept how my life has turned out to be very grateful, @ CAPS2 I was not adopted, I could not @ CAPS8 have known my @ PERSON1, the most loving, adventurous, funny and wise women you have never encountered. As soon as I could walk @ PERSON1 would have me camping and hiking @ CAPS4 her. @ CAPS2 @ CAPS6 was a beautiful sunny day, no one would have any doubts if we would be. @ CAPS2 we were at @ PERSON1 in the @ DATE1 or @ DATE2 we would always be outside in his gardener how @ PERSON1 @ CAPS3 his gardens and flowers. No waiting, that's a lie @ PERSON1 @ CAPS3 period of nature. @ CAPS1 taught me how @ CAPS8 appreciates everything around me especially nature, @ CAPS4 me and her we are closer than anything you can think of, @ CAPS2 she is the sky in her stars , @ CAPS2 I'm a bird @ CAPS1 is my wings. @ CAPS6 is quite simply. @ CAPS6 hasn't always been easy for her and me, but the way we know how @ CAPS8 is doing is that @ CAPS8 is making fun of everything and everyone, not in an intimidating way or making fun of one way, but in a good way. Laughing for me and my @ PERSON1 comes like second nature @ CAPS8 us, @ CAPS6 is what keeps us going and knowing that everything will be fine. A few months ago my favorite cousin @ CAPS7 passed away, @ PERSON1 and I had seen each other for a while or talked, but it all happened so fast @ CAPS4 @ PERSON2. That when we saw each other @ CAPS6 was at his funeral. My sizemore family was all there, even though @ PERSON2 was gone he had a presence that was still there. That night after the funeral everyone went to my aunts @ CAPS8 to hang out. Finally @ PERSON1 and I got the chance @ CAPS8 to talk yes we both had tears in our eyes but we were laughing @ CAPS8. He once went to @ CAPS8 to pick up my uncle from the airport and he was waiting there in his elvis costume holding a sizemore sign..The boy was @ PERSON2 an idiot. @ PERSON1 was just telling me all of these things, and @ CAPS6 was then that I realized that @ PERSON1 had taught me something else that @ CAPS8 appreciated. @ PERSON1 had taught me how @ CAPS8 appreciates both laughter @ CAPS4 heartbreak. @ CAPS8 rejoice in the hour of business, @ CAPS8 has hope when you feel like you've run out. I've learned that even though people might not think so, laughter is the key @ CAPS8 remedy for everyone's pain. People don't think of laughter as a cure, they think of @ CAPS6 as something you do after hearing a joke. Laughter is more than what people attribute to @ CAPS6. My @ PERSON1 taught me all of these things, plus the true meaning of laughter, and it will always be @ CAPS4 me.

Laughing is one of the things we do best. @ PERSON1 and I talk almost every day and never get tired of laughing. We talk about everything and even though it's the saddest thing in the world, we can make it funny in a way, it's just one of those things we do. As best friends it's our job to make each other feel better, and if one calls the other out crying it's their job to make them laugh and if it's funny for both of them @ CAPS2 please know that it was a job well done. At @ DATE3 my uncle passed away I called her crying she said everything was going to be fine and think of all the good memories I had of him. One of the only ones I could think of was the funniest story of my life and even though I was still crying, through those tears there were laughs and I knew my uncle would want me to laugh and he was there to laugh with me. @ PERSON1 and I met @ DATE1, at @ ORGANIZATION1, where we spent a week away from our @ DATE1 to meet new people and get closer to @ CAPS1. This week has been one of the funniest weeks of my @ DATE1, although @ PERSON1 and I didn't "click" on @ ORGANIZATION1 that week, we later found out that we were more alike than we were. did not think so. Some people say that when two people are very similar, friendship doesn't work. Well, it is true but false. When @ CAPS2 looks the same, @ CAPS2 can talk to each other about anything, but when @ CAPS2 hits those differences and the other doesn't agree, it starts a fight, but the fights just bring people together. Even though @ PERSON1 and I don't see each other much, that doesn't mean we can't be best friends. What if your best friend lived in a different state, does that mean he's not your best friend anymore? No, that just means @ CAPS2 doesn't see them as much as @ CAPS2 would like. Even though we live close to each other, we don't always have time to see each other, but when we finally do see each other, there is no dull moment. About a month after @ PERSON1 had a bad car accident we went into the world of skateboarding, @ PERSON1 was on crutches so she couldn't skate, but that didn't stop her from having fun and playing. make @ TIME1 laugh. She was dancing to the music, over the seats shouting, "@ CAPS2 will never see these people again in your life, why don't you just have a little fun ?" At @ DATE2 @ TIME1 she made almost everyone in our group dance on the stools and I don't regret a thing that happened that @ TIME1 was the most I had laughed at in about a year . We danced and screamed for about three hours, before one of the parents got theirs and after that we all went home. It's a @ TIME1 that I will never forget. Girl recovering from horrible car accident made the most of what she had! When things don't turn out the way we wanted them to, we go on with our lives wishing it were different, but when we look back a few years later, we'll see that everything was fine, and that's @ MONTH1 just doing laugh @ CAPS2. it's hard to laugh at something, but a good thing to do when @ CAPS2 gets to this point is to think of something happy or funny and try to laugh. Laughing has always made me feel better, and knowing that I can make someone with a difficult life laugh until they're about to pee makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I've done something right in my life that I was ready to help @ PERSON1 in their struggles. For me, that makes this life a life worth living. While @ CAPS2 can't help everyone through every one of their struggles, just being there sometimes helps them more than @ CAPS2 @ MONTH1 knows. @ PERSON1 and I have planned many lives that we would love to live and looking at them now all I can do is laugh because in my heart I know they will never happen. Even though we do our best to make them happen, I doubt they will. But it was worth it to laugh and have a good time catching them up, and I believe they were going to happen for a while and I know looking back in a few years, we'll both be laughing. Laughter is a great way to let go of fear, anger, and stress. It makes @ CAPS2 think of all the good times @ CAPS2 has had in your life and lets @ CAPS2 know that @ CAPS2 had fun in your life. Although we do fight, in the @ DATE2 I don't think anyone can tear @ PERSON1 and me, with all the laughs happening. We are real friends.

 To laugh. Something everyone does. It's natural, organic, normal. They say kids laugh more than adults, maybe @ CAPS6 babysits them. They can still let that deep instinct for fun express itself in bursts of cheerful noise. Laughter is always unique to each person. Some have musical laughter, others deep giggles. Then there are those from @ CAPS10 or those who snort or giggle, the kind of laugh that makes @ CAPS8 laugh because @ CAPS8 hears it. These @ CAPS10 my favorites. Someone once said, “ Laughter is the shortest distance between two people ” and I totally agree. Laughing with people has been the biggest influence in my relationships with my friends. I have five girlfriends who I couldn't live without. They support me, love me and force me to be bold and step out of my comfort zone. There have been many sleepovers where at two in the morning, all @ CAPS8, here's the laughter from all of us at a shocking confession from @ TIME1 or the horror of “@ CAPS8 would he rather ? ” Someone comes by. to find. a @ TIME1 in particular was particularly funny. it was the last @ DATE1 and we slept on the porch of @ Organization1. it was a spectacular @ TIME1, the stars were out, but the air was cool and comfortable a meteor shower was happening later that evening. @ PERSON3 started the conversation with her favorite tagline, “@ CAPS1 guys how's life ?” All of us @ CAPS16 because if @ CAPS8 @ CAPS10 around @ PERSON3 for over an hour @ CAPS8 will say here @ CAPS2 times. "@ CAPS3 like five minutes ago," I replied. "@ CAPS4 guys my life has completely changed," @ PERSON1 said sarcastically. " @ CAPS5 really? " @ LOCATION1 asked, her little body curled up in her sleeping bag," @ CAPS6 a @ CAPS8 had a rollover. e personality, @ CAPS11 @ CAPS8 '@ CAPS20 now blonde and stupid? " " @ CAPS7. " @ PERSON1 said sarcastically, rolling his eyes, a very @ ORGANIZATION1 gesture. We @ CAPS16 at the ridiculous mental picture of the "brain" being stupid. "The guys at @ CAPS8 would like to play @ CAPS8?" @ ORGANIZATION2 has arrived. I had thought she was asleep now. All I could see was her red hair covering her face. "@ CAPS9 !" @ PERSON2 shouted, "I can't stand my mind being filled with horrible mental images!" she buried her face in her pillow, trying to block the images. "@ CAPS10 @ CAPS8 of course? I have new ones." @ PERSON1 said in his best evil voice, "@ CAPS11 should be @ CAPS8 ..." "@ CAPS9!" we all screamed together and laughter ensued. "@ CAPS13 or @ CAPS14 ?" @ PERSON3 suggested. An unintelligible noise came from @ ORGANIZATION2's pillow. "@ CAPS6 said @ CAPS8 ?" I asked. She lifted her face with sleepy eyes. "I '@ CAPS23 too lazy, and unless @ CAPS14 has to be the first one asleep, then I' @ CAPS23 is not playing !" she let her head fall back on her pillow. "I agree," added @ LOCATION1, "I @ CAPS23 too lazy." "@ LOCATION1 it would take @ CAPS8 four hours just to get out of this porch because @ CAPS8 '@ CAPS20 so @ CAPS21." @ CAPS16 @ PERSON1. "@ PERSON1 I '@ CAPS23 not @ CAPS21. I' @ CAPS23 @ CAPS17 !" "@ CAPS5 just accept it @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS8 '@ CAPS20 @ CAPS21 !" “@ CAPS9 @ PERSON1 I '@ CAPS23 @ CAPS17!” We continued @ CAPS11, joking back and forth until people slowly started to fall asleep, flying into the cool air of @ TIME1 . I was the last one awake, and as I watched the meteor shower, I had a sudden revelation. My life was pretty great right now. It was @ DATE1, @ CAPS9 school, @ CAPS9 stress. I was lying on a porch watching a meteor shower, listening to the sounds of @ TIME1 and feeling perfectly safe, and I had the five best friends I could wish for. We joked and @ CAPS16 with each other, but this is the first step in being so comfortable with people that @ CAPS8 can tell them everything. Laughing with someone breaks the ice, it brings us closer. Lying there, I suddenly realized that because of all our jokes, I felt comfortable enough with these girls to tell them pretty much anything, and I wanted to. I had never felt @ CAPS11 this before. That I could do anything because there were five people supporting me in anything. I smiled inwardly and closing my eyes imagined all the laughter I was going to be able to enjoy with these friends.

 One day, one day before the party for my brother's @ DATE1 to be exact. We were making party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because that was where the boy would hang out and sleep. My cousin @ PERSON4 and I were helping mom and the boy who were already there and their names would be @ PERSON5, @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2. @ PERSON6 was already there of course because he is the boy @ DATE1. The boys were supposed to clean the apartment but their boy and the only things they care about are the girls and the video games. They played video games instead of cleaning up and mom got mad. Lucky for them, mom was in a really good mood or they would have had @ CAPS7. The last to the boy has arrived now. The last two boys have introduced themselves and their names are @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON1 is showing up tomorrow afternoon. @ PERSON6 was so excited he was @ NUM1 he said "I'm @ NUM1 now nobody can tell me what to do" and I laughed and said "@ PERSON6 is going to make me a sandwich" and he said "@ CAPS3" and I said "so much because no one can tell me what to do" and everyone laughed at him. He gave me my sandwich and all the boys went to the apartment to clean @ CAPS7 but when I walked in they set up @ PERSON5 @ NUM3's x-box and were playing @ CAPS7. I told them to clean up, but they decided not to listen, so I took mum and they certainly listened to her. She took @ CAPS7 and put @ CAPS7 on the kitchen table. They weren't happy. They finally cleaned the apartment and got the x-arc back. @ TIME1 we were all watching movies and playing wide games, then mum told @ PERSON4 and me to clean my room, maybe an hour later, she came by and said "bedtime" and the boy is going to the apartment. The next mourning. The next mourning @ PERSON4 and woke up with the sun hitting our eyes and said "what a great way to start the day" and @ PERSON4 said "I know". The best part about today is spending time with the boy. When @ PERSON4 and I entered the living room, everyone was in the kitchen and partly in the living room. @ TIME1 that @ TIME1 the boy thought @ CAPS7 would be fun if they played cops and rubbers. The apartment was the prison. @ PERSON2, @ CAPS2, @ PERSON6 were the cops and @ PERSON5 and @ CAPS1 were the rubbers. @ PERSON4 and I wanted to play so we went out and met @ PERSON5 on the otter side of the apartment, he was the only one who knew we were outside. When I was running and hiding behind the trees I would fall into the water hole in the apartment and my leg looked like cottage cheese and @ CAPS7 was gushing blood and my bone could be seen. I had to stop playing for @ TIME1. Mom told @ PERSON4 and I to go to bed. The next grieving mom woke us up and asked if we wanted eggs and bacon and we said "yes". I crawled out of bed because I had to go to the bathroom so @ PERSON4 helped me up the stairs and when we were going down the stairs @ PERSON5 saw me in pain and being the amazing boyfriend that he is he picked me up and carried me to the couch in the living room and sat me down on the couch and kissed the top of my head and said "good mourning beautiful" and said "good mourning to you baby". Now everyone is waiting for their meal to be ready. The boys make pizza if you want to know. Then my little sister @ CAPS6 came into the kitchen and said "Ma'am, I want a cookie" and mum said "okay there you are baby". @ CAPS6 ran away with a really big smile on her face. The boy has his pizza now and they've just got back to the apartment. @ PERSON4 and I looked at mum and I said "wow" mum like I know. We all laughed and started talking about the boys and friends, family, animals. @ CAPS7 has been a great fun weekend and although I hurt myself we still got the most out of @ CAPS7. Even though I got hurt and can't do anything for the next couple of months or so, we still had a great time and @ PERSON6 said "@ CAPS7 was his favorite @ DATE1 so far. @ CAPS6 wanted his friend do it. come on but she had fun with mum and @ PERSON4 the boy is when they came home and I. Sometimes you have to work with what you have and @ CAPS7 can be more fun than your normal plan that you made. you are happy with the people around you.

                                        The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ PERSON1 is an essential item for me to survive this crazy thing that is life. So instead of writing about an experience where laughter is a key element, I'm going to write a montage of real events where laughter shows my true colors as to who I am. I think I should start with my blonde moments, first how is my natural hair color. When I was little I would take my shirt off, throw it on the floor and I was like "mom, I can't find my shirt" @ CAPS6 would say to me, "@ PERSON1 @ CAPS21 just threw it on the floor", I would look in all the wrong places and result in crying on the floor. @ CAPS6 would pick up my shirt off the floor and hand it to me, then I would do the same again. Yeah @ CAPS21 could tell I was a little embarrassed when I grew up and they had it on video camera but that's what I love @ CAPS21 growing up and laughing at what was once embarrassing and @ CAPS21 move on. There was another time when we figured out my initials spelled @ CAPS7, so every time I go swimming with my brother and our friends they start singing the @ CAPS8 theme song and I laugh because if I Let them think I don't care will end up with @ CAPS4. Guess what, they still haven't stopped and I'm starting to think @ MONTH1 will be stuck with the nickname @ CAPS8 for the rest of my life. The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 kept rolling when I was in first grade, my brother, who @ CAPS5 was in second grade, decided to tell my grade one teacher that I had @ CAPS10, @ CAPS6 called my parents, who started laughing like crazy and told him yes, @ CAPS6 did his little thing called @ CAPS12 @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14. Looking back, it's funny because I remember the look on @ PERSON2's face; @ CAPS21 could say it was classic. As I progressed through my @ CAPS16 years to move to @ CAPS15 @ CAPS16, I joined an organization ; the @ CAPS17 @ CAPS18 from @ CAPS19 for @ CAPS20, where I later learned that the color black is prohibited in all @ CAPS19 functions. Well the night I was initiated I wore black from my hair accessories to my shoes. I didn't feel any embarrassment, just the urge to laugh. I later found out that I like to make jokes or funny comments whenever I get nervous during a speech, so when I had to get up and give a speech in front of around 120 people, I made little effort to make jokes and comments. , did I mention I wasn't very @ CAPS1 in jokes, but the ceremony continued and people laughed along with me, even though I hit my head on a dream catcher. @ CAPS19 taught me that it's okay to cry over the depressing things in life, it's okay to fear the things that scare me @ CAPS21, it's okay to love someone @ CAPS21 wants , it's good to live your life, but the most important thing is to laugh at your mistakes. I think this is something I will always remember and pass on to my kids when I settle down with a family, which won't be for a while. I learned this lesson when I was babysitting my little cousins, who were sick, it's a lot of responsibility, it's one thing @ CAPS1 that my brother helped because I almost would have been lost without him. I know because of the people around me with their positive attitudes and hearts or that they've trained me to be a better person, to laugh when there doesn't seem to be a way out, not just to learn of your mistakes, but to laugh it off as well, to show that @ CAPS21 has a deeper meaning for the way your life was meant to be lived. Remember when life gives you lemons @ CAPS21 take the opportunity to make some sweet lemonade then throw it all over yourself so @ CAPS21 and your friends can laugh @ CAPS1 every now and then. Thank you @ CAPS21.

                Twins For a @ CAPS1 Laughter is a big part of who I am. I am a very happy and outgoing person, and I love to laugh. I especially have the laughs that make it look like your stomach is going to drop out of your body and keep laughing on the floor. This is @ CAPS23 I surround myself with people who are like me, this is my best friend @ PERSON1 and I am like two peas in a pod. People tell us all the time that we look like twins, and when we're together @ CAPS24 is like a hurricane of loud, crazy laughs. The best part about our friendship is that we look alike, I think, and we use @ CAPS24 to our advantage. A @ CAPS1 @ PERSON1 and I were walking downtown. We were just window shopping, when we walked past a clothing store that featured an auburn tank top with blue swirls coming up from the bottom and top to one side, as well as a pair of blue jeans. dark with a tear at the knee. @ PERSON1 and I fell in love with the outfit, and as we stood outside the window like hungry dogs drooling over a freshly cut piece of meat, an idea hit me. When I turned to @ PERSON1 and j Said "@ PERSON2? (his nickname) @ CAPS2 if I were you and you were me when we @ CAPS14 meet @ CAPS3 later ?" She turned to me and her eyes lit up like @ CAPS24 was @ CAPS4. We ran into the store and bought the outfit. We looked at each other in the mirror and we both knew we could end this betrayal. The pants hug our curves, which are identical, like a glove, and the tank top rests on our body in the same pattern. The only difference was that she was a bit taller than me and my hair was longer than hers, but we decided that showing a little neck wouldn't be that bad, @ CAPS7 we just threw our hair up in a bun and called @ CAPS24 fine. As we left the store, we were asked if we were sisters, and we simultaneously replied "@ CAPS5, a little" @ CAPS24 was the assurance that if we could cheat them, we could cheat on anyone. We comfortably walked over to the county library lawn where we met @ CAPS3. when we were by the library lawn @ PERSON1 turned to me and said "hide behind that tree, say i come in, then sneak up and freak him out!" @ CAPS7 I hid behind the tree as she went up to say hello, he asked me where I was and she said "I actually don't know" as she rummaged in her bag, " but I think I dropped something there, I'll be right back, stay put. " “@ CAPS8,” he replied. All the while I was sneaking around the back of the garden and hopped off an embankment and said "@ CAPS9 I am !" he was gawking at a car parked down the road, he jumped a bit and I said "@ CAPS10 did I scare you?" in a little schoolgirl voice, and he said "@ CAPS5, of course not! A man is not afraid." I just rolled my eyes and he and I said "I have something for you, but you have to close your eyes". He was worried at first but he did like me @ NUM1 had managed to sneak up behind him, and when she tapped him on the shoulder he turned around but he gave me a puzzled look as he did it. When they were face to face, @ PERSON1 shouted "@ CAPS9 @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14 !" and @ CAPS3 almost hopped on the moon. @ PERSON1 and I were laughing @ CAPS7, we almost peed in our brand new pants. @ CAPS3 in confusion whipped his head between @ PERSON1 and me, and said "@ CAPS16 that's interesting", we continued to laugh like buffoons, and @ CAPS3 even laughed a little. He told us "@ CAPS18, you never do it again!" and I said "@ CAPS19 ! We're basically sisters @ CAPS7 @ CAPS23 not playing the part ?" he just looked at me with annoyance and @ PERSON1 rolled his eyes and said "@ CAPS2 ? Was the man scared ?" We both broke up again and @ CAPS3 just smiled because he knew we were playing. @ CAPS24 was just a blast after that, @ PERSON1 and I continued to torment the city as twins. We ran around the cars and through the stores and had an amazing time being absolute jerks. We even made @ CAPS3 laugh hard enough to make his stomach squeeze. When @ CAPS24 was @ CAPS14 time, we ventured into the parking lot where @ PERSON1's mom was going to pick us up, she did a triple take when she saw us, she just laughed at us when we walked in and asked "@ CAPS23 are you both wearing the same @ NUM2 and i just looked at myself and burst out laughing, and we said" @ CAPS24 is a long story ". @ CAPS24 was the perfect ending for an amazing @ CAPS1 being my best friend.

 Somewhere along the road a guy once said " a laugh a day keeps the doctor away ." @ CAPS1 was he talking about hell? I didn't really know or understand the importance of it either. Until I found out firsthand how important those words could be and how right this unknown genius was. Just a few years ago, the most traumatic event happened to me. Do you remember the first girl or guy you thought you liked? If you can, can you remember that feeling of utter grief and helplessness ? Well if you can maybe you will understand how I was feeling ... and I do feel it sometimes. Otherwise, you @ MONTH1 learn something important that you might understand why you are single. Before this particular event, when @ CAPS2 and I ended up fighting, we ended up making jokes about it to pass. Sometimes we would intentionally go to romantic movies to laugh at how the girl or guy would fall apart while crying. In one of those sobs that cry, just odious cries. The kind that gets on your nerves more than making you feel nice. Coming back to the last key point in all of this, when the horrible situation happened @ CAPS2 and I had been together for years, two and a half to be precise. yeah, I've known for a long time. The day it ended it was in the middle of a math class (can you believe it? In the middle of a fucking class !) @ CAPS4 convinced me to go sit in the corner of the room with it. It would be just us, no interruptions. We did this every day so it wasn't unusual for me. I thought "Yeah! I work alone with my amazing girlfriend!" I was an idiot. I fondly remember glancing at him before I sat down. @ CAPS4 was wearing bleached jeans and a black t-shirt. @ CAPS4 had skin so white and unblemished that a porcelain doll would be jealous. To top it off, dirty blonde hair, rose petal lips and trust me on endless curves. I was dressed the same. I was in my @ PERSON1 t-shirt, black jeans and my signature burgundy beanie. I had naturally tanned skin and dark brown curly hair that covered my dark green eyes. When I sat down I wasn't exactly sure @ CAPS1 was, but I felt like something bad was about to happen. Almost like an oncoming thunderstorm or that paranoid feeling of being watched. The most awful words came out of his mouth like water from a tap. "We have to break" my heart clenched in my chest her other words scrambled into one becoming inaudible. I remained motionless and completely silent like a stone gargoyle. I couldn't help but laugh at myself silently in my head. I never answered anything. I didn't have enough confidence in my voice to be steady and unwavering. Even though my words weren't ... my body did. I couldn't control the tremors in my body like it had a big muscle spasm. I walked out of the room quietly and quickly, making sure I had my bag in hand. I didn't want a reason to have to come back. The hallways with the tiles and possibly the grass with the pouring rain all mixed into one. I just kept walking and walking, with no wear and tear on my mind. Until the moment when I was finally too tired to stop. My cheeks were streaked with tears down my jaw and my eyes were red and bloodshot. The most wonderful thing in the world for me in my life was over. Thinking back to the relationship between @ CAPS2 and me, laughter was how we survived and been through a lot. It was not enough, however. No attempt to laugh at it would help, like those petty arguments we had. I will sometimes look back on how I reacted and that in itself will make me laugh. I was no better than these people in these movies. Unlike them though, I didn't cry or bawl in obnoxious ways.                                                    

<START>

 

 Side by side with my best friend @ PERSON1, we start to walk to the park. The rain on @ DATE1 @ TIME1 was not very pretty or hot, but the pleasures of looking lost and desperate in this particular park of @ LOCATION1 were enough for us. As I approached the grass benches, mud dominated my shoes when I began to think otherwise of such pleasure. Sitting on the benches filled with damp leaves, we notice a man and his child walking towards us. Although this man looked quite odd, we quickly got excited because what he had to tell us was more than likely going to match his appearance. The man looked in his thirties with tight pants covered in what appeared to be a sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a matching little hat he had that warm and flamboyant look. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one within easy reach while the other is lounging in a storage pocket below. The dad we find out later claims his @ NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like "@ CAPS1 WAS THAT" ?! suggesting he hadn't heard her when we knew she hadn't said anything at all. "@ CAPS2 wants me to ask girls if they want raisins, does @ CAPS2 want" ? odd enough, we watch the raisins cram them between the cracks in the benches the few times he looked away. @ PERSON1 and then I look at myself when he starts to say how beautiful and striking his eyes were. Laughter watered our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem himself, he wanted to burst out of us both. The man then pulled out his phone with a video of a country singer comparing their faces to each other. A few minutes after the start of the video, I look away since the phone was now in the hands of @ LOCATION2. I can feel her pushing me to leave her even with my eyes and I hadn't continued to suffer with the ridiculous video. Looking up, I see the father looking at her like he's waiting for a reaction. Back at @ PERSON1, I noticed how uncomfortable we all were, including his kids, and he didn't even have a clue. Throughout this interaction, I hadn't said more than @ NUM1 words between silent laughter and always looking I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being rude then passes the phone with a smile on her face and flushed cheeks. " @ CAPS2 really looks like its @ CAPS2 knows " ? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing in us. The boiling silence rose between us and very little we could handle afterwards. Taking out a script, the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us one day. Once he spilled those beans on us, we rushed straight to his house while pouring out our massive amount of laughter that was restrained and affecting our ability to speak. breath by breath as I ran, I could finally speak, blurting out how I could barely comprehend the reality of his request. We thought that another day at @ LOCATION1, but for us every day was just a laughing matter.

 Have you ever had a detention for laughing too much in class ? If you haven't, you're very lucky. I know teachers absolutely hate students who are not careful in class, or students who randomly laugh when they teach. I am that student who laughs at random (in preference to my own jokes) in class. In other words, I am a teacher's worst nightmare. Ringtone ... ringtone ... ringtone, it's @ CAPS1 time. It was a beautiful afternoon and I felt good! When I entered the class, I automatically noticed that our teacher was not himself blessed. But I ignored it and continued with what I normally do, ie pull out my @ CAPS2 and turn it up. I love listening to music because it relaxes me and helps me focus more. The downside to listening to music is that you can't hear everything as well. When I listen to music I have those moments where I feel like I'm in a movie where everything seems to be in slow motion but you don't hear anything. It's almost like I'm isolated in my own little world and no one can see or hear me, until I start laughing. Eventually class started and everyone was unusually loud, at this point I was starting to see steam coming out of our teachers' ears. He looked like a cartoon character from Bugs Bunny. The teacher was getting very indignant and impatient with the class. I didn't really pay attention to him so I went back to listening to my music. After a while, our teacher started to get even more frantic with the class, so he told everyone who spoke again that their name would be written on the board and you would receive a detention. About five minutes later my friend @ PERSON1 comes and walks past me and starts talking to me. When I listen to music I tend to speak loudly because I feel like they can't even hear me. So I start screaming, and she starts laughing because when I wasn't looking my teacher was staring at me wondering why I was speaking so loud. He turns around and writes my name on the board (that means I got a warning). I turn to look at the professor, oh no there you go, @ NUM1 my laughter is off I couldn't control myself. When I laugh uncontrollably, I laugh like there's no tomorrow. "@ CAPS3! You owe me thirty minutes detention!" my teacher said. One of the biggest problems I have is having fun very easily, mostly laughing about anything and everything. When my teacher yelled at me, his facial expression was just too funny, so I started to laugh even louder. When I start to laugh my friend @ PERSON1 usually can't help but start laughing with me. She told the teacher that she was the one who made me laugh so she thought she deserved detention too. So she got what she wanted, detention! A week later @ PERSON1 and I arrived in good old fashioned detention with all the other "rebels" (that's what my name is now) makes me feel tough. The thing we have learned is that we should never be sitting next to each other. When we sit next to each other, we can't stop laughing, but we still decided to sit next to each other. What do you know, we almost had more detention during detention, imagine that. “ @ CAPS4 is too short to live with tension and regret, so laugh it off ! " This motto is what I try to live every day. I feel like laughing is a very important part of my @ CAPS4, it really helps me forget what bothers me. Even though @ MONTH1 I'm in trouble laughing, I don't regret it at all. Some people are very serious and don't know how to let things go so they are always tense. Laughter releases tension and for me it feels like it brings me closer to my friends. I love to laugh with my friends and the feeling of having sore abs while laughing is awesome! Live your life, laugh as much as you can, and love those who matter most to you.

How to Laugh @ CAPS1 Laughter can be a big help when you are going through difficult times. Like when my brother got run by a skid steer loader (loader tracking) on our farm. We had no idea how great it was going to be @ CAPS2 thanks to our uncertain time our family was there to be with us and help stop us from going down. It was just another day on the farm and we were running the machinery. The day was going well until after dinner my mom told me and my brother to go out and cut corn. "@ Mom CAPS2" me and my brother said in unison. She didn't hear it and told us to hurry up and go. So we went down to the shop and got the skid steer loader on. My brother, @ PERSON1 still has not gone down and so I started it and started driving towards the garden. I saw my brother coming out of the corner of my eye. He was running as fast as he could and I yelled at him to stop and wait @ CAPS2 he kept coming. He tried to jump on the front fork @ CAPS2 failed and fell. I got out of the cabin and saw him lying on the floor crying. My uncle was standing nearby when he arrived and called the ambulance. We had no idea what was going on with him @ CAPS2 his leg looked a little funny as we took a closer look and saw the bone sticking out of his leg. Finally, when the ambulance arrived, they looked at it and asked me a few questions about what had happened. I told them all I could and went home. It was very nerve-racking not knowing what was going to happen to the leg @ CAPS2 we didn't hope it wouldn't be a big deal. I spent the night with my grandparents. I had a hard time getting sleep that night though. The next morning was @ DATE1 so I had to go to school. I didn't know much @ CAPS2 yet I didn't know my brother's leg broke a compound fracture. The whole school day my friends help me feel better by telling jokes and funny stuff and just keeping my mind off the accident. It was hard not to know what was going on with him. Later that evening - there, we went to see it. We learned that he had just broken the large bone in his leg and had come back together very well. My mom stayed with him the entire time he was in the hospital, so things around the house were another little bit. Me, my father and sisters had clean and take care of the house. It was a pain because I hate doing the work of the house and having to do all the time was annoying vary. When my mom and brother finally got back after about a week things got a bit back to normal. My brother had ware something on his leg that sucked fluids out of the wound to help it heal faster. There were giant screws sticking out of his leg which are attached to a bar on the outside of his leg. He has healed that very well and has a giant scar where the bone came through his leg. It was lovely to have family and friends there to cheer us up and help us through. And that's why the @ CAPS1 laugh.

 We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter can show emotions, but it can also go as far as strengthening a friendship or relationship. For many people, laughter is a very important part of any relationship. First, laughter is very important in a friendship. If you can't have a happy and fun friendship, you won't have a good friendship. Building a friendship is always difficult sometimes. It can take up to a good laugh, not to laugh at all, to determine your friendship. Having a friendship with someone is one of the best feelings. Knowing that you have someone you can trust, to talk to, to be there for you, and to have the most important laugh with is a great feeling. In addition, laughter is important in all childhood memories. Thinking back to when I was little, I always laughed. Even though my mom and dad left me and my brothers, I always had my grandparents, brothers, cousins, even my aunt and uncles to keep me busy and always have a good time. I think laughter is an important thing being a kid because it's healthy you can learn to keep the morale of others and keep others laughing and happy. and it's always good to have a strong, fun and happy relationship with your family. Finally, laughter is very important in a relationship. I think it will strengthen the character of your relationship and show everyone that you are happy with the person you are with. Laughter will also build a healthy, strong relationship and lead to good things. If you think about it, laughter is probably the most important in a relationship because when you decide to marry the person you are with it will keep you from getting a divorce and arguing and you will have a strong relationship. So after stressing that laughter is important regardless of age, gender, friendship, childhood, or relationship, you should see my point is that laughter is important regardless of the situation. It helps build a strong person and also builds character in yourself.

 Have you ever been in an awkward situation and relaxed the mood with a laugh ? I like a lot. I find that laughter makes people more comfortable, which allows them to be their own person. The @ MONTH1 laugh even helps some attract a positive, friendly crowd that likes funny and happy people. Laughter @ MONTH1 doesn't work that way for everyone, but here are a few ways it has helped me. I was in a group of school kids at @ LOCATION1 years ago and didn't know anyone there. After walking for a while, this girl spoke to me. She was funny, and being able to laugh made me feel more comfortable and I had a great time. I just had to find the right person. Another time laughing might have helped was when I was invited to a friend's birthday party that I hadn't seen in over two years. Several more were there that I hadn't seen for a long time. The whole visit was awkward and all I wanted to do was blend in. I acted like everyone else, but if I had laughed and been more comfortable, I would have been my own person. When I first arrived at public school, I was nervous about meeting new people and knowing what kind of people there would be. After about a week, people got to see my personality, the funny, happy, laughable person inside, and it clicked with a lot of people. That's why I'm friends with the people I'm friends with now, because our personalities are alike. Laughter has brought me to a good place in life. Laughter can make many people happy and comfortable in difficult situations. It can encourage people to show their own personality and attract people like them. I think the world would be a happier place if everyone could laugh.

@ CAPS1 up kids, my mom said as she rushed to get her things ready and packed. I knew exactly what I had done wrong, I didn't set my alarm on my phone until six in the morning. I put it at 6 p.m. and now we're late. Thinking to myself, I hurried to get my clothes ready for the week. six pairs of pants, six pairs of shirts, six pairs of underwear and six pairs of socks. I put my bag next to the front door now realizing it was next to my other bag I had already packed the day before. My sisters were worse, as the girls they take to always wear makeup and straighten their hair. Finally, everyone's packed, but it was now seven in the morning and we were supposed to be at @ LOCATION2 now and were still sitting here at our lodge. As my sisters are now finished and we are in the car, we can finally get off at @ LOCATION3. As a family, we've been preparing @ CAPS2 for a month and now it's @ DATE2 ! I was really excited to go. At point @ CAPS2, I had butterflies in my stomach. We lived @ LOCATION1, we were only halfway @ LOCATION2 eight hours ten to make us among cousins of my mother. I feel sleepy for the first two hours of the trip and can't sleep anymore. I was stuck in the backseat doing nothing. so I started to sing the song endlessly. @ CAPS2 is the song that never ends, and it goes on and on my friends. "@ CAPS3 my sister in the front seat yelled at me very harshly to shut up. I didn't stop and she yelled at me again to stop singing. For a third time I annoyed her and my sister responded with a punch on my arm. For some reason I started to laugh. It didn't hurt and I thought it was funny that she hit me just for singing a silly song. I had a really weird laugh so my little sister started laughing because I was laughing, then my older sister yelled pretty harshly at me and my younger sister to be calm. My older sister at me. knocked again trying to keep from laughing. Now I was laughing so hard I could barely breathe and my face was turning purple. It was really funny when my mom couldn't hold it anymore and started to crack and crack. laughing with me and my younger sister. My mom wears dentures and she was laughing so hard she almost fell out of her mouth while she was driving, we started to r ire louder. My stomach felt like it was going to explode from all the laughter. My older sister was now turning a shade of dark blue from yelling at us to silence us. She raised her arms in the air and screamed one last time to shut up and threw herself into her seat with a look of very mean disgust on her face. CAPS3 we stopped and ate. We enjoyed our lunch and hit the road as we still had a long journey on our hands. I quickly felt tired and fell asleep in the most uncomfortable position you can find in a car. I had my head against the door, my arm above the front passenger seat, one of my legs was on the seat and the other between the driver and passenger seats. had about half an hour until we reached the house of the cousins of my mother. We were in the mid-west of @ LOCATION3 and the mountains were so beautiful. They were full of color and life with gigantic trees swaying in the wind, squirrels moving from tree to tree, planting nuts in the ground. It was the farthest I have ever been from where I lived at @ LOCATION1. I was glad it was with my family. My stay at @ LOCATION3 was unclear. I can barely remember most of what happened there. I played with a neighbor kid the same age as me playing video games and eating unhealthy junk food. My mom was the happiest of us to get out of @ LOCATION1 for a weekend. She hadn't seen her cousin for about three years and was very happy to see her. Now was the time for @ DATE1 to resume our normal life, so we packed our bags and headed home. I managed not to speak and anger my sister for about the first minute. @ CAPS3 I started singing the song again endlessly. I have never laughed so much in my life. "

 My immediate family members are known to be both incredibly clumsy and easily surprised. Broken dishes are a common occurrence in our home; just like spilled drinks, crushed toes, and creepy screams every time the toaster spawns. While we're all used to this stuff, not everyone around us is, which can lead to some interesting dating. A lot of people enjoy kicking me on the sides to hear me scream and laugh when I stumble over even the smallest crack in the ground. While it can get boring at times, @ MONTH1 also gives me a reason to overcome my pride and laugh at myself, relieving any tensions @ MONTH1 feels about the social setting. For example, a few years ago I was staying with my troop @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 at @ LOCATION1. Any situation involving large groups of people can be intimidating, but it becomes more and more terrifying when the group is made up of girls between the ages of four and eighteen, with only a few adults thrown in to make sure the girls don't hang out. not club to death. Worse, where I was staying, which was a hybrid somewhere between a cabin and a tent, the majority of the girls were in college and, needless to say, we didn't always get along. Despite the fact that we weren't all best friends in the world, there were times when we were able to overcome the little differences, like who was cool and who wasn't, and make the most of the time we had. to talk and joke. with people who were in similar places in life. On such an occasion I was trying to make my bed on one of the top bunk beds and I was stretching my sheet over the petrified mattress that @ MONTH1 may have been in @ NUM1 @ CAPS3. vs. Being the smart person that I am, I decided to lean against the wall behind me to keep my balance, forgetting, of course, that there was in fact no wall, but only thin, similar material. to a fabric, which could not support my weight. The second I realized what I had done, I frantically searched for something to hold onto and tried in vain to keep from collapsing to the ground and certain death. A few milliseconds before I crashed into the hardwood floor, I managed to grab one of the bars on the side of the bed and hung on for life, rocking back and forth and back and forth. backward. Finally, I let go and propelled myself, almost gracefully, onto the bed sitting under mine. It took a long time for the laughter to die down. In that short span of time the cliques, prejudices and grudges were all forgotten as we became not just a bunch of random girls placed together in a room, but a bunch with our own strengths and weaknesses ; passions and flaws. Although the teenage years are incredibly difficult and it often happens that you feel like the loneliest person in the world, it is always heartwarming to know that there are other people laughing. and cry like you and live the same joys. and embarrassment as you do. One of the most essential skills to learn is that you need to be able to laugh at yourself from time to time and leave yourself vulnerable in front of others. We @ MONTH1 are not all the same, but we all have the same basic desires for love, acceptance and laughter.

While living at @ LOCATION5, I met the two people, who are now my best friends, @ PERSON1 @ CAPS14 @ CAPS1 @ PERSON6. I have met them both in totally different ways. @ PERSON1 started the school, @ CAPS14 @ CAPS1 started paintball. I met @ PERSON1 when she moved from @ LOCATION3, @ LOCATION1. his father was in @ ORGANIZATION1, @ CAPS14 had been transferred to the base which was near my home. We had lunch together at two classes @ CAPS14. At first its @ CAPS14, I didn't really speak much. It wasn't until one of my friends, @ PERSON3, took her to sit with us over lunch. Our friend @ PERSON4 was too hyper hyper that day @ CAPS14 ended up falling backwards in his chair @ CAPS14, scaring girls passing by at the time. We laughed so much that our faces turned cherry red. After lunch we had class together so we walked together @ CAPS14 talked about lunch. I then asked her to sit with me during @ CAPS3. We couldn't stop talking to save our lives. Fortunately, it was a free skit day, because if it hadn't been, we might have been in trouble. After about a week, @ PERSON1 @ CAPS14, I found out that we had so much in common that it almost seemed unreal. I had never met a girl who could make me laugh so hard that I really enjoyed spending time with her every day. She was making faces @ CAPS14 telling me stories about her past that would make me laugh out loud. We talk almost every other day on the internet, @ CAPS14 even though she is over @ NUM1 miles away she can still hurt my stomach from all the laughter. As for @ CAPS1, he grew up to @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION5, then later to @ LOCATION4. We met while my dad, my brother, @ CAPS14, I went paintballing at a place called "The @ CAPS5". It was a slow day. There weren't as many people in the fields as usual, @ CAPS6 some how there weren't enough tables. We offered to share ours with two guys that I discovered were friends of @ CAPS7, @ CAPS8 @ CAPS14 @ CAPS9. Later that day @ CAPS1 @ CAPS14 a few more friends, @ PERSON5 @ CAPS14 @ PERSON2, have arrived. The matches got a little more interesting, but no one had yet been able to shoot me before the referee called the time. I was starting to get irritated by the lack of experienced players, when finally I felt two sharp paints @ CAPS14 heard a splash. I had taken photos with the leg, the mask, the trigger finger @ CAPS14. At the end of the match, I spotted the guy who took me out. This person being @ CAPS1. I ran to him @ CAPS14 said "@ CAPS12 @ CAPS13". He laughed @ CAPS14 said "it was bad luck I chose to take you out". I asked "so why didn't you take me out first? Huh? You know that was such a @ CAPS12 @ CAPS13". He came back with "I was just going easy on you, I didn't want you to feel bad." At that point I had a smile on my face @ CAPS14 a laugh in my voice "sure that's why". We kept joking about the game, @ CAPS14 the people playing that day. When it was time for me to go he wrote his email on a small piece of torn cardboard, @ CAPS14 asked me to keep in touch. As soon as I got home I sent an email saying "I still think it was a @ CAPS12 @ CAPS13". Since that day, we've been best friends. Always in almost every conversation, one of us @ CAPS8 mentions the @ CAPS12 @ CAPS13, @ CAPS14 it makes us laugh every time. Even though I don't see my best friends every day, we still make each other laugh from a distance. It's just that now I can make new people laugh, @ CAPS14, I hope I can make some other wonderful friends like the two I have already discovered.

               The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 started a few years ago when I first met my cousin @ ORGANIZATION1. For the first time, I spent the night at his house, the day before we were out all day running in his yard and jumping off their roof. @ CAPS3 was a lot of fun and entertaining, but no matter what we did, @ ORGANIZATION1 had something to say about every little thing we did or saw. “ It looks like this ! Or " she looks like this !" " @ CAPS4 his tone of voice and his unique way of yelling @ CAPS3, I couldn't stop laughing. @ CAPS3 was unbearable, @ CAPS3 made me laugh so hard and for so long that my stomach was starting to ache and @ ORGANIZATION1 himself was starting to laugh watching me slowly collapse from uncontrollable laughter. @ CAPS3 don't s It didn't stop there, later that evening we stayed awake most of the night watching @ CAPS1 videos on @ CAPS6 and playing @ CAPS7 on @ NUM1. The laughter got even bigger as we both got extremely tired and our minds jostled in our thoughts, we laughed until the point where I fell down laughing and holding my stomach. Every word that came out of the unstoppable mouth of my cousins made me laugh as if I heard the funniest joke for the first time. The next morning I had immense muscle pain in my chest, a sign of a fun and humorous night. . even then @ ORGANIZATION1 still had a way to turn my stomach pain into a topic @ CAPS1. The next morning we had breakfast and @ CAPS3 was just as fun as the day before. Listen to comments and jokes nonstop on every thought and every topic and every thought possible. The day continued @ CAPS4 the eternal laughter between my cousin and me. Later on leaving I thought to myself how much more fun I would have the next time I came to visit. From that moment @ ORGANIZATION1 and I became best friends and times got better and more fun. Without laughing, life would be incomplete.

 One day it was almost @ CAPS1 and my sister, mom and I were all in the kitchen making desserts and a bunch of food for dinner from @ CAPS1. My mom had to leave and go to the store to get more ingredients. After my mom left my sister and I were still busy working in the kitchen. I was working on one thing and she was working on another. Eventually she finished baking the cookies and decided to help me with the lemon blossoms (lemon iced cupcakes). The instructions called for a quarter cup of lemon juice. @ CAPS4 I told my sister to remove the lemon juice from the lemons. At this point I am making the cupcakes, my sister is yelling at me and asking " did I just press @ CAPS3 ?" " I think she has cut @ CAPS3 says yes. Well I was wrong my sister yells at me again and says “@ CAPS3 doesn't work.” @ CAPS4 I turn to find her squeezing an uncut lemon trying to squeeze out the lemon juice by @ CAPS3. I just looked at her, told her she needs to cut @ CAPS3 and started laughing. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard. While I'm on the floor crying because I'm laughing out loud @ CAPS4, my mom walks into the kitchen with a bag full of groceries and the first words out of her mouth were "@ CAPS5 did @ CAPS6". @ CAPS7 if you can believe @ CAPS3 I started to laugh even louder. In addition, my sister to this day is still called lemons. It's because my family and I thought @ CAPS3 was funny @ CAPS4 that all of our family and friends should know about this little experience my sister had with lemons. From this experience I learned that laughter is important in @ CAPS4 in many ways, @ CAPS3 can bring friends and family closer together, @ CAPS3 can strengthen any relationship. This experience ultimately made my sister and I much closer in many ways and now we still laugh together and I'd rather laugh than fight with her. My sister and I, since that incident, have become @ CAPS4 much closer to the point now that we can tell each other anything and everything. I think everyone should be laughing because you might not know that laughing at the dumbest thing could improve any relationship and bring the two people closer together. @ CAPS4 Live life to the fullest and laugh as much as you can because you never know when a good laugh might help you become friends with someone or get you closer than ever.

 After a long day at @ ORGANIZATION1 mom said it was my turn to decide where we were going for dinner that night. I chose @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 because I love their seafood. We have @ CAPS6 thighs, popcorn shrimp and coconut breaded shrimp. After the food we had two slices of double chocolate lava cake. For some reason this made us laugh. We laughed so much that we started to cry. We had just finished shopping for clothes at @ ORGANIZATION1 and mom said I could choose where we were going to eat. My brother started whining about it, but mom said it was just because he had chosen the last time. I chose @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, which my brother said he would have chosen anyway. I chose this restaurant for two reasons, first because it was close to @ ORGANIZATION1, and second because I love seafood. Mom didn't have a lot of money, so she said that we should all share a few things instead so that everyone has their own. We bought two books @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 legs, and an order of popcorn shrimp and coconut breaded shrimp (mostly for herself). I'm pretty glad we all shared as it was cheaper and it was just the right amount of food so we didn't have to take any boxes home. Either way, we never eat leftovers. After our dinner, my brother and I begged our mom to buy dessert. after much thought and conviction, she said okay and ordered two slices of the best cake i have ever tasted in my life! It was so rich that my mom and I could finish our slice of barley. My brother swallowed his with ease. After we were done the waiter came over and replaced our plates with the tab. We all took a look and decided to skip dessert (which never happened). Then mom had a bad case of giggling. Soon after, my brother and I caught giggles like an illness. The laughter turned to laughter and the laughter turned hysterical. We couldn't figure out what was so funny or how it happened. People were starting to stare at us but we still couldn't contain ourselves. Very quickly our eyes started to cry, then there were tears. Tears of joy I imagine, but I'm sure of one thing, we had to get out of this. Mom managed to pay the bill very well, but as soon as she got in the car and made my brother and I laugh, she started to crack up again ! She was absolutely convinced that was the cake. she said there is no other reasonable explanation that we would laugh and laugh at nothing. Now I believe this statement because we have tried all the other desserts and none of them had the same effect on us. We go back whenever we know we can afford dessert and want to have a good laugh. I guess it's not just the seafood that I love. I rather like the cake too. We call it the Double Chocolate Laughter Cake.

The friends of @ CAPS1 of Laughter @ CAPS2 and I always find a way to make each other laugh and have a good time. The friends @ CAPS2, @ PERSON2 and @ ORGANIZATION1, are very similar, but completely different. Both are active and humorous girls. You could almost say that they are sisters because of the closeness of their personalities, but it's their appearance that shows the opposite. @ PERSON2 is tall and lean, with short black curly hair. Her fair skin has an olive green tint. Her appearance gives her the impression that she has a deep secret. The mystery is hidden behind her baby blue eyes. @ CAPS2 another friend, @ LOCATION1, has the sun shining from her hair. Each golden curl ends at her navel. The freckles, which lightly cover her fair skin, only appear on her cheerful cheeks. Her eyes look like the deep blue ocean. You can only imagine swimming in such an amazing blue color. A @ DATE1 @ TIME1, as the sun was setting on a cold @ DATE2 @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 the girls and I decided to learn the dance @ PERSON1 @ CAPS4. After a night of training, I gave up and lay down on the full-cushioned sofa, which comforts every part of @ CAPS2's body. Two hours pass and the girls have understood it. They both had leg steps and every move like @ PERSON1. They were so good they could have been @ PERSON1's booster dancers. After a while of accomplishment, we realized how ridiculous the idea was and we stopped. @ ORGANIZATION1 begged to redo the dance, but with the camera recording. A few minutes after pressing @ PERSON2 I started the music and hit the record button. The girls were doing very well, but began to forget some steps. Out of nowhere, the two girls, at full speed, collide with each other. It was silent except for the music playing. Each of us looks at each other and starts laughing to death. @ PERSON2 and @ ORGANIZATION1, get up crying with laughter and apologize to each other. It all happened with me recording. After we got settled in we watched the most amazing personal video. Remembering fun times like this makes me realize how grateful I am to the friends at @ CAPS2. It makes me feel good to know that we can all be ourselves together. Without them, I wouldn't know what laughter is.

  Can you imagine life without laughing? Life without laughing is simple, boring, and boring. Laughter is an important part of life. There would be nothing to wait for if there was no laughter. Laughter creates memories, relationships and fills the awkward silence between two people. Some people don't realize how important laughter is. Life without laughter is like life without water. I think that's how important laughter is. The quote "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." is true, but laughter is more than an element. It's much more important than that. Well I guess we could all live without laughing, but who would? No laughing means no fun times like : swimming, water parks, ice skating, dancing, etc. These funny things can lead to laughter. With nothing fun to do, no one would look forward to tomorrow. Every day would be a waste if there was no laughter in the world. Some people might just think that laughter is just one thing. Why is that? Laughter is important enough to be more than that. For example, water is an element because it has something to do with the earth. It represents the ocean. Laughter does not fall into this category. Laughter has a huge impact on our lives. Laughter makes everything better dozens of times. Laughter creates memories, memories create relationships. This is why laughter is such an important part in any relationship. It's amazing how the smallest thing can make such a big difference in our lives.

The @ CAPS1 of laughter. Laughter is an integral part of most everyday lives. It's a very common emotion that I see hundreds of times a day. Whether it's from something as simple as a face, a joke, a picture, and even little things that people do or say can make even the most serious of people laugh. The friends of @ CAPS4 and I are constantly laughing. We can do something funny with just about anything. I think being able to laugh and joke are really good qualities to have as a person because it makes life so much more fun and upbeat. I can't even count the number of times I've been completely giggling because of friend @ CAPS4 @ LOCATION1. She is hands down one of the funniest people I have ever met in @ CAPS4 in my entire life. While she's extremely funny, she isn't exactly the brightest pencil in the box. She asks questions after people have already told her the answer, she says exactly what I say after saying it without even noticing that I have already said it before her, and sometimes she even stumbles on concrete while doing running someone to their car after training. The things she does @ MONTH1 are sometimes not very smart, but they can definitely make anyone laugh. I remember not even a week ago I was in the car with @ LOCATION1 on the way to volleyball practice, and she just sang the wrong words to the song we were listening to . What made it even funnier was the fact that even though she knew the words were wrong, she kept singing as if she knew every word. At the end of the song, we laughed so much we cried. By the time we started to practice it I had laughed for about ten minutes straight. During training, our @ CAPS3 was explaining the instructions for one of the exercises. She told us loud and clear to serve the ball at points one and five @ CAPS2. @ LOCATION1 not fully understanding the instructions, decided she should ask and make sure everything was clear to her. So she raised her hand and asked, "@ CAPS3, so are we @ CAPS2 serving at points one and five ?" @ CAPS4 the whole team burst into hysterical laughter. @ LOCATION1 who didn't understand stood there looking confused, but when she finally understood why we were all laughing, she joined her. This happened about three times during our two and a half hours of training. She was even placed in the front row which made us all laugh as she is so tiny and looked really funny next to the six foot one girls standing right next to her. At the end of training I think we trained better laughing than playing volleyball. Getting out of the car, @ LOCATION1 decided she wanted to run a girl from our team to her car. @ CAPS5 agreed and they took off in a dead sprint. You could see the determination to win on @ LOCATION1's face and suddenly they were nowhere to be found. I walked up the stairs to see who won, @ CAPS2 to find @ LOCATION1 face down with @ CAPS5 sitting next to her laughing hysterically. I felt bad, but it was so funny I couldn't help but laugh. We sat there laughing for a good quarter of an hour, and we laughed about it all the way back. It was the icing on the cake of one of the funniest days I have ever had. I will never forget that day and all the times we laughed together. I think @ LOCATION1 and I can laugh so much together brings us closer as friends because even if we get mad at each other, or something bad happens, we can still find a way to laugh about it at the end, and that's something every good friendship should have. Laughter can't always make everything better, but it can be a @ CAPS1 for someone, and you never know the positive effect a small laugh can have on the most cranky people.

 A lot of people think @ ORGANIZATION1 is like everyone else. These people are very wrong. @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 is very different from most. Because you see, it's full of humorous people. These people are a big part of the good side of @ ORGANIZATION1. Where are these people you will ask me? Why, they are everywhere. Best place to look is in the hallways, especially @ DATE1 @ ORGANIZATION1, during lunch, @ CAPS2 after @ ORGANIZATION1. Most of the people I'm going to tell you about are friends of mine. There are also a lot of people whose names I don't even know. There's even a teacher I'm going to talk about. Well, enough chatter, let's go, okay ? I'll start with the teacher first. I forgot her name but she likes to speak with an accent @ CAPS1. She is also very enthusiastic, @ CAPS2 I mean enthusiastic. She often says : "@ CAPS3 let's go !". This is very fun. I have never seen her without enthusiasm. A lot of students are really upset about it. It can be boring at times but at least it's not all dingy or whatever. In fact, we might even need more like her in this @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS2 and many more. There is also a student who is also very enthusiastic, not all the time but it is quite often him. Its name is @ CAPS4. @ CAPS4 is a pretty happy kid. He loves to sing. I mean he loves to sing. Even if he does not know the lyrics of the song he is singing, he will sing. People are always joking about him around him. Jokes are usually mean jokes, but he puts up with them @ CAPS2 laughs. I really have to give it so much credit. It would be hard for just about anyone to put up with such rude words, let alone laugh at them. But enough of that. He's very happy @ CAPS2 really makes you laugh, which is really awesome. Don't stop being funny @ CAPS4. There is a funny pair of boys who can knock your shoes @ CAPS3, maybe even literally with what they do. These two boys, named @ PERSON3 @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1, are very humorous, as well as dangerously humorous. Have you ever heard of an @ CAPS6 ? It is a brand of very fun toys for young and old alike. This toy is shaped like a bowl. You flip it over, point the ledge to the ground, @ CAPS2 drop it. When it hits the ground, it looms into the air. Well @ PERSON3 @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1 love playing @ CAPS6 so much that they've found a whole new way to play with it. Instead of hitting the ground with it, they hit each other with it! They like to hurt themselves. Eventually, however, the @ CAPS6 got badly worn @ CAPS2 ripped. He had to retire from his hard job, but @ PERSON3 @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1 wouldn't let him. They just couldn't stop playing with it. @ PERSON2, @ CAPS9, @ CAPS2 I haven't seen them play with it lately. We think he may have broken. Ha ha! Never marvel in the hallways with @ PERSON2, even if you have a destination. Believe me on that, you don't want to! @ PERSON2 is very easily distracted in the hallways. If she sees someone she wants to talk to, she doesn't tell you. She just hovers around @ CAPS2 and rushes towards them. To do this, always ask him to take the lead if you are accompanying him ; at least you'll know when she asks @ CAPS3 for the track. However, @ PERSON2 is still very humorous. She makes a lot of random sounds. You completely get @ CAPS3 guard @ CAPS2 just can't help but laugh at the weird sound of these sounds. @ CAPS9 on the other hand, not only sounds but also hilarious facial expressions. She always tries to emulate the fun things her goats do @ CAPS2 when she tells us about it. Together, @ CAPS9 @ CAPS2 I am very funny. At the start of the @ DATE1 finale we were drawing such goofy pictures of each other @ CAPS2 random things. I drew it as a snowman heading for the moon, but the moon was very far away. We fell for it! She once redrawn a little comic that her brother had been thinking about for over a year or two. In the comics it was a very ugly man telling his friends they were going to a nightclub, but the ugly man turned out to be a woman. During the finals there was also a guy who was pulling his friend through the halls by the arm. The friend said it was very comfortable. Then they told a teacher about it! Hahaha! So you see, @ LOCATION1 is much more than a regular @ ORGANIZATION1. You could probably call him a clown @ ORGANIZATION1 if you wanted to. Ha ha ha ha! You would never really know how many ha ha I say per day before your visit, so come on. We will let you have fun!

 Everyone knows that long car journeys can be both physically and mentally exhausting. Imagine a family of four: a mother, father and two daughters in @ CAPS1. The father is at the wheel, the mother is in the passenger seat, the older sister is on the left in the back seat and the younger sister is on the right. The sun is rising and you are still on the road. The father is tired after driving all night. The mother has just woken up yawning and wondering how much time is left until the destination. The sisters are looking out their windows with extremely bored expressions. Even with cups of coffee and loud music, the atmosphere is still lifeless, extremely dull. What could bring this lifeless atmosphere back up? I guess, some form of entertainment. As a child, I was always on the road. Moving from one place to another, because of my father's job. At the time, we lived in a state known for its snow. @ ORGANIZATION1. Wonderful wildlife, breathtaking views and magnificent landscapes untouched by man. During the long winter months, snow covered the ground, like a blanket on a bed. You might wake up in the morning to two new feet of snow. Although, despite living in a cold and isolated state, the summers were extremely hot. A total twist for someone who doesn't know the weather from @ ORGANIZATION1. It was about a decade ago, so the surroundings may have changed, but nonetheless, it is still a beautiful and breathtaking state. After I got home from school on a cool day on @ DATE1, my mom told me to start making my room. I knew we had to leave this @ DATE1, but I was still hesitant to leave my friends. Every time we moved I had to say a heartbreaking goodbye to friends I knew from the few years I lived there. I went to my room and started packing for a long, long trip. My dad came to me and told me we were going by car. He asked my sister and I to go with him so he could get the uHaul back. We went to check the sizes and the condition it was in. As usual, the trucks weren't in the best condition to travel the long haul, but it's better than nothing. My dad brought it home, along with my sister and I, and my dad started putting the wrapped boxes on the truck. My mom, sister and I finished packing the rest of the boxes. The boxes with valuables and mandatory were stored in my mother's @ CAPS1, as well as our cats in their cages. After packing and loading everything, the hired uHaul employees drove the uHaul to our new destination, @ LOCATION2. Everyone had mixed feelings about leaving. My mom loved his neighbors, my dad had great coworkers, my sister and I made some spectacular friends, but we had to say goodbye to our friends. It's not the first time, and it's not the last time, but every time it always hurts. The moments spent together will remain forever etched in our memories! Here we go ! In our new temporary home. Driving from @ LOCATION1 to @ LOCATION2. The only thing I didn't like was that we were due to be at @ LOCATION2 in less than a week. A week to drive this far? Less stops, more driving, and no fun or visits ... a total brake !! It was really chatty and energetic at first, but everyone quickly got bored of being on the road. My sister's body didn't take it well at first, and neither did mine. Halfway through @ LOCATION2, all conversations stopped. The atmosphere began to fade, as did the excitement. There was absolutely nothing to do in such a small space. I wanted to try and make the rest of the driving fun, so I started singing in my low voice. Ever since I was so young my voice cracked in the middle of the song we were listening to causing an uproar of laughter! My mom started to say that I was just lovely, and my dad started to laugh at me. My sister started singing too, and before you knew it everyone was singing! Morale was high and everyone was having fun singing and laughing. We started to be more active after that too ! The rest of the trip south was full of energy, and time and distance flew by. It's always fun to spend time with the family, but it will get even better if you pass the time in a fun and exciting way ! Make things fun, keep a positive and enjoyable outlook on everything!

 Laughter can be beneficial not only for ourselves, but also for others. We seem to only use it when you feel the urge to become happy, but in reality that shouldn't be the only reason. Laughter isn't just about being able to feel better, but also letting go of what you need to let go. Being able to have fun is a pride and you should feel better about yourself. Every time you laugh, how do you feel? Do you feel like the world is flying off your shoulders and feeling better about yourself? I don't mean to say you have to laugh so hard and hard that you fall off your chair and roll over, but a simple laugh would do. Watch your favorite movie or go have fun with friends, as long as you laugh you'll feel better about yourself. This brings us to what's going on around the @ CAPS2 family. When I was younger I would go on a trip with the family @ CAPS2 to @ LOCATION2. At the time, I lived @ LOCATION1. Each @ DATE1, we would cram five to nine people into a van and get going. With hardly any space of your own, you wouldn't think it would be fun. Overall we would have some arguments over where to stop on the way to the food or when to turn around, but nothing too big of a deal. Being younger than everyone else, I was madly bored. So, to solve the problem, I would get the @ CAPS2 family to tell jokes, make faces, do something. Just as someone let out a joke or make a face, I burst out laughing. Pure happiness and pure innocent. It didn't mean they were funny or even trying but to let go of the intense shoulders I laughed. When we got to where we were staying on the great-grandparents @ CAPS2 land, we would once again cram into a small area for sleeping. Everyone would get a cot and endure the warm daylight and bitter freezing cold @ TIME1. The cold nights were the ones that touched us the most, as @ CAPS2's great-grandparents had land, which meant the place we had to stay didn't filter the heat. The sleeping bag and clothes on the back were the only things we were able to get. So when the sun slowly moved away from its bright light among us, we bundle up. Knowing myself I didn't listen to what the @ CAPS2 family was sad about and drank tons of water before resting @ CAPS2 with my head against the cot. If you have common sense, which it wasn't when I was younger. You would know that if you drink a lot before bed and the cold is surrounding your body, you will need to use the toilet at some point during @ TIME1. Because @ CAPS2 aunt was only @ NUM1 years older than me, she should be the one who should wake up to walk me outside, down the aisle, to the doorman, wait for me, then go back to sleep trying to shake off the chills that controlled her like the puppeteer. Knowing @ TIME1, she was not happy with @ TIME1 situations, I'm sure no one would. The last time she took me, she made sure it was the last time she got up to take me to the bathroom. The @ TIME1 came over that she had to take me. We started to walk down the aisle. The wind was unlike any other night, tearing all over the place and piercing @ CAPS2's skin. Another weird thing about @ TIME1 was that instead of the dull, tired face that Aunt @ CAPS2 usually would have, she was awake, more awake, seemed to have a slight smile on her face. As it was pitch dark, she had the flashlight with her. She opened the door to let me in and pointed the light into the cracks so I could see more clearly. Once I was done I felt the doorman's pot shake and heard in a monster's voice the "@ CAPS1 was coming to get me, run, run, run!" @ CAPS2 blood rushed everywhere, the heat is what I remember feeling. Pushing the door, shouting, running for the "safety" of @ CAPS2 is what crossed @ CAPS2's mind. When I realized Aunt @ CAPS2 wasn't with me, I looked back. Only to find her laughing uncontrollably at what just happened. The meaning of @ TIME1 would be that you can just turn a bad situation into a good one if you rearrange the problem. You can make it a laughing matter instead of a dreaded moment. @ CAPS2 aunt making me do something she would find funny would make better sense to her and relieve her of whatever she thought she was feeling. It is cause and effect placement. Panicking me made her more comfortable.

 Have you ever felt really good after laughing a lot? Well, studies have shown that after laughing not only do you feel better, but it's also a great way to lose calories. Once, when I was feeling bad, my cousin came over and made me laugh. It was a very important part of our relationship, it only made the day better but put more energy into it. When people aren't laughing, how can you have so much fun? Studies have shown that laughter does a lot for your health. It increases some blood flow to your brain, which helps a person to be more energetic and happier. He has also shown that laughter can lengthen life. Plus, every time a person laughs, it helps a person burn calories. If it's healthy for you, why not laugh a lot? Think about it, if no one was laughing, what would this world be like? It would be boring and full of unhappy people, like this time my cousin came to see me. One day, I was feeling down and depressed. Nothing was going my way and it ended in a very bad day. Then all of a sudden my cousin came to @ ORGANIZATION1 and surprised me. I was at @ ORGANIZATION1 one day after school and was looking at some stuff when she walked into @ ORGANIZATION1 and sneaked up behind me and scared me. We both started to laugh so hard. She turned a bad day into a fun day. We had a movie night and ate candy and pickles the night away. We composed songs and sang them. We had the best time of our life. All night long we had this party. I don't know what would happen to everyone if neither of us ever laughed. If we didn't laugh, our relationship certainly wouldn't be so strong. It seemed like we were sad or depressed all the time. If they weren't laughing, I wouldn't be so excited to see her if we just sat and laughed. Laughing for me is a big part of the fun in any relationship. It shows that you are comfortable with the person and that you are having fun as well. If you've ever been depressed and wanted to give up, you know it's no fun at all. But whether you're watching a funny movie or talking to your friend and it makes you laugh, you know what joy it brings to your life. Laughter should therefore be an important part of your life or any relationship you have. Overall, laughing for me is one of the most important things one person can do to make another person feel welcome and comfortable around you. It's also a great way to have fun and lose calories at the same time. If you need happiness in your life, watch a funny movie or date people who make you laugh.

Social @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 People think of laughter as a way to show how you feel, almost like an emotion. I look at laughter in a different way. Laughter is a form of communication. Sure you laugh @ MONTH1 when something is funny, but the truth is you can control it. So does @ CAPS5 make people laugh ? They laugh to get a message across; basically, they let you know that what you said or did was fun for them. Over time, laughter can build relationships, or even start them, all because when someone laughs at you or with you, you share common ground. I know that laughter is an important thing in my life because, without it, I would never have met my best friend. When I started sixth grade, I was scared. I was afraid of losing all my old friends and becoming one of those kids who sit alone in the cafeteria every day wishing I had someone to eat their fatty pizza with. Of course, I was overreacting, but the thought was still in my mind throughout the first few days. Soon I even started to notice that my friends were actually finding new people to date, and I started to feel like I was becoming the outcast I feared I was. Then I met him. He was a skater boy with black hair that fell in front of his eyes and white, almost pale skin. I was with one of my rare friends, @ CAPS3, when I saw him ride near the front of the school. I didn't really think much of him other than the fact that he had some of the coolest shoes I've ever seen. I was actually surprised when @ CAPS3 walked up and started talking to him like he had known him forever. I walked with him to avoid the image of an outcast. As soon as we stand in front of him he says something like an insult that I would usually treat as nothing, but this time for some reason drove me really mad. I said things back and before I knew it we were at a verbal war. In the end, I knew one thing: I hated this kid, and he hated me. Around the middle of the year our school had a dance. It was the first dance I was going to and I had butterflies in my stomach. I took a tour with an old friend of mine, @ DATE1. I liked @ DATE1 because he was never judgmental or anything, he was just friendly. When we were in the car to go to college, he told me he needed to pick up more, which didn't really bother me until we got home. The house was not very impressive, it could have been a cardboard box for everything that mattered to me. When I saw the kid's left foot come out of the house, I knew exactly who it was. When he got in the car, I pretended I hadn't seen him. I have failed. The whole drive was nothing but awkward. When we got to the dance, I walked on the right side of @ DATE1 to avoid the confrontation. @ DATE1 increased your blood pressure and stopped walking. What he said next surprised me a bit. “ @ CAPS5, can't you get along ? " We both were there, eyes closed, when the young skater made another of his" nice comments. " I thought it would be the start of the year again, but I did something I didn't expect to do: I laughed. He laughed too. It was almost as if for the first time we were friends. All night long we hung out and danced like crazy. We had become friends. During the rest of the year, we became more and more friends. We went to the other's house and hung out at school. That's when I realized we were best friends. Even now, in ninth grade, we're still best friends. It's crazy how a little laugh can escalate into it, but that's what happened. I don't know how laughter can do that, or @ CAPS5 I even laughed that night, but one thing's for sure: laughter is important.

 As I entered the classroom, I started to shake with anxiety. I was the new fourth grader, moving from a public elementary school to a @ CAPS1 school, kept my head full of questions, which I put aside as I walked into the room with a big "@ NUM1 "white on the exterior wall. I swear I could feel my bones literally shaking from my nerves. Surprisingly, no one approached me when I entered. I noticed they were all circling this @ CAPS4-go-lucky brunette. No one really noticed I was there until the professor looked up. After introducing myself to her and the class, I looked at this brunette who was previously surrounded by the group of my future peers. She smiled at me as I stood there, my feet glued to the ground uncontrollably, staring blankly at her for a few seconds. When someone told me that this girl was the other new student in their class, I understood why everyone was staring at her. I quickly became green with envy for her because of all the attention she received. I was unwittingly a pretty jealous kid, and when I noticed that everyone wanted to be their friend and that I was somewhat ignored, my stomach slowly twisted more and more each day as I started. to develop feelings of mistrust and aversion towards this girl. Even his name sounded suspicious to me. @ PERSON1. In my life, I had never heard of someone called @ PERSON1 before. Fortunately, I sat across the class like her. And even after a month, I still felt uncomfortable being around her, so I stubbornly avoided her. My birthday quickly started to approach after the first month at @ LOCATION1. I was starting to find out which people I wanted to be friends with and which people to avoid. Unfortunately, even the people that I had gradually grown bored had to be invited to my birthday party as it was a class party and I didn't want to leave anyone behind and since the class was only about 30 years old. of people, I could only deduce that word about the party would spread and people would start talking. I knew I didn't have enough reputation for people to know who I really was or what my personality looked like. As I was putting an invitation in everyone's beige square locker, I hesitated when I came across "# @ NUM2". It was his number. The number of that girl with the weird name that I had an undeserved and resentful suspicion of. I cursed myself violently after putting that birthday party invitation in her locker. When the day of the party finally arrived, I had everything set up as I imagined. I even picked the perfect @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 cake for myself. Guests began to arrive knocking on the glass door, temporarily staining it with small grimy knuckle prints. @ PERSON1 came alone. As I opened the door she shyly and immediately pushed a gift and shyly muttered under her breath "@ CAPS4 anniversary @ CAPS5". I greeted her traditionally, as I did with everyone else, and I took her around the courtyard. The party continued in several directions until my mom got everyone together so I could blow out the candles. @ PERSON1 walked up beside me. With a confused expression on my face, my mom leaned over to whisper that @ PERSON1 was having the same birthday as me and that she would blow out the candles with me. I could not believe it. The person I had selfishly pretended not to exist with was the person I was to share my cake with. After I blew out the candles everyone left as the party ended and I pouted silently at having to share my birthday with another person. After the party I walked into the house, only to find @ PERSON1 sitting on my steps. Her mother apparently couldn't pick her up for an hour. I walked over to her and started chatting with her casually. A few minutes later, my brother came running in with a huge scoop of frosting in his hand. He yelled at me @ CAPS4 birthday and threw it in my face. I was shocked and didn't know what to do. He ran downstairs to his bedroom as I stood there with my mouth gaping. Then I heard someone laughing behind me. I turned to see @ PERSON1 laughing. And without warning, I started to laugh too. And neither of us could stop. That's when I realized I was wrong about her. We spent the rest of the hour playing and laughing, and by the time her mom arrived, we were begging for a sleepover. Although we weren't successful, I had come to understand that this girl was someone I wanted to get closer to. @ PERSON1, thanks to that first laugh, became my best friend and continues to be my best and closest friend today.

 My best friend @ PERSON2 and I have a tradition that we made up. Whenever she comes to my house, we always go down the stairs in a sleeping bag. We found @ TIME1 @ CAPS4, she was playing @ TIME1 at my house. As I was sitting on the stairs doing nothing, it suddenly hit me. I turned to @ PERSON2 and said "@ CAPS1 could two little girls do for some fun in the middle of @ TIME1, @ CAPS4 all they have to work with is a long staircase that stayed right under their nose all the time? " and to @ TIME1, she says "I'm listening". @ CAPS2, we were both excited because we finally found something fun to do. I said "I'll show you. We just need to get all the pillows we can find." We both walked around the house, looking in each room and brought back all the pillows we could find on the stairs. "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS1 do we need all these pillows ?" @ PERSON2 asked and was surprised @ CAPS4 I said "for the padding". @ CAPS4 the pillows were installed at the foot of the stairs, I told him about my great plan. She loved it! We were eager to get started. “The purple @ CAPS5 sleeping bag will be perfect for @ TIME1,” @ PERSON2 said. I ran down the hall to my bedroom, grabbed my sleeping bag, and ran for the stairs. My purple sleeping bag is super smooth and was just what we needed to get down the stairs. @ CAPS2, @ DATE1, we are fourteen and fifteen @ DATE1, we are still having fun doing @ TIME1. During @ DATE1 we made it better, which makes it nerve-racking and a lot more fun. @ PERSON2 and I agreed to some safety precautions, which we felt were necessary. @ CAPS4, we just use the sleeping bag, we don't need it, but as we added we agreed to wear a helmet and sometimes add a few pillows. The helmet scares my mom a bit because it is even necessary. A @ TIME1, while my parents were away, @ PERSON2 and I had eaten way too much sugar and were extremely hypersensitive. We were both sliding down the stairs but it was starting to get too easy and it wasn't as fun as @ CAPS4, we had about @ DATE1 @ DATE1 old. We wanted to make it even bigger and better than ever! We started to think. My brother's bedroom was upstairs and we kind of wanted to incorporate his mattress into our enjoyment. @ PERSON2 and I dragged the mattress up the stairs. We both sat on the mattress, pushed and walked down the stairs. We could barely hold the mattress. The further down the stairs, the more we slid off the mattress. We were laughing @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 we got to the bottom, we almost hit the wall ! It was @ CAPS3 a lot of fun. After that first ride we decided we had better put an extra pillow on the wall somehow. One thing we hadn't thought about before heading down the stairs was how heavy the mattress was. It was very difficult to go up the stairs, but we didn't mind because we were having a lot of fun with @ CAPS3. @ PERSON2 and I were tired @ CAPS3, we decided to take a break. We both pulled the mattress up the stairs, one last time before collapsing onto the sofa in the room across the street. Not so long ago, my mom bought an inflatable bean. Shaped like a real bean and had handles on both sides. @ PERSON2 started playing with it, and @ CAPS4 she said “@ CAPS6 try it?” We both rushed up the stairs, ready to have some more fun. Our imaginations bounced off the walls. @ TIME1 times we both felt it was time to mix it up for the ultimate ride. We kept the mattress up the stairs and measured exactly where we needed my sleeping bag. Our idea was to sit on the exercise bean, on the mattress, slide off the mattress, land on the sleeping bag while waiting on the stairs to give us a turbo boost, and finally be sent flying in the pillows from the bottom of the stairs. I found @ CAPS3 duct tape, the @ PERSON2 could stick the sleeping bag to the floor. @ PERSON2 let me go first. I was nervous because we had never done @ TIME1 before. After a minute, finally pushed. It was a bigger fall from the mattress to the stairs than I expected. @ CAPS4 I landed on the sleeping bag, it was like being inside the @ PERSON1 video game and hitting the turbo. It was scary but @ CAPS4 I got to the bottom we were both laughing uncontrollably. We had a lot of fun with @ CAPS3.

                                                   THE @ CAPS1 A few weekends ago my cousin and I were at my grandmother's. She lives in the woods and has a bunch of quads and motorcycles. All me and my cousin have done is ride, wage gun wars, and build giant forts. We had planned to stay only one night but ended up staying three. So the first night we were there, we built a fort in the woods. The fort looked really good at the time, but the next morning we had other ideas. So the next morning we were getting ready to go out and work on the fort. He finished before me, so he went there first. By the time I got halfway I heard him scream and run out of the fort. He was shouting @ CAPS2 ..... MICCCCEEEEE ! So I thought we must have a little problem @ CAPS2 and laughed to myself. So I went in there to see for myself and sure enough there was a bunch of little @ CAPS2 running around in there. It was the end of ground forts for us. The next day, we decided to have airsoft wars (pistols that shoot small plastic balls). We had a lot of fun shooting each other mainly because it hurt. Like I said, we were having a lot of fun until I decided to try and hide in a little tree. He found me and shot me. I fell from the tree and broke my gun. It was the end of the wars and I almost broke my leg. Guess it was revenge for laughing about the mouse. After the wars were over, we decided to go quad biking for a while. There are a lot of trails around her house for riding. He was riding an all-terrain motorcycle and I was riding a quad, I was riding a quad so that I could make new trails. We did some really good trails up there. It was really muddy up there and very wet. While we were out in the woods for a long drive, I ran out of gas. So I had to walk to the house to get gasoline, then pick up everything there was up there. The last day we were up there we got up early. We wanted to go out and find a place to build a new fort. This time we were going to make a fort in the trees so that we didn't have to worry about the creatures. We spent time when we got up until when we got home on this awesome tree for. My grandpa has a lot of wood that he doesn't use because he's too old to build anything, so we never ran out of wood.

 We would all go into the woods to quad and trike, @ PERSON1 and @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ PERSON1 had quads that I was the only one on with the trike. We loaded the tricycle and quads into the back of the truck and trailer and headed for the woods. We take theirs out and unload our rides, we warm them all except the one with a clutch. the only way to start this one is to pull it with the auto quad Wilber tells @ PERSON1 he will make it start then you pull me. I get up and hook the rope to the quad aech @ PERSON1 says it's ready so @ PERSON1 takes off quickly and kinda like the hook comes off and hits him perfectly on the back he gets up and it looks like he's dancing . He lifted his shirt up and asked if there was a mark, oh man was there the hook hit him perfectly, it looked like a hook that was printed on his back. @ PERSON1 starts to slow down while holding his back. I wouldn't blame him, I would, you could hear him slam when he hit him. I look @ PERSON1 and he tries not to laugh, @ PERSON1 looks @ PERSON1 and gets off the quad and starts chasing him. I finally got attention and said, "We came here to ride, not to kick ass." we finally get the bike going, but @ PERSON1 was too scared to pull the quad so i had to do that, as soon as we got the quad warmed up with the clutch, a cop car comes down next to us then turns on its lights. We learned what we were going to have to do as soon as I saw @ PERSON1 take off, I left. @ PERSON1 and I look back to see if @ PERSON1 was behind us and no he wasn't. @ PERSON1 told me we just had to leave him, but I told him that would be a way of spoiling our return and the cop told us he was surprised we came back. we asked @ PERSON1 what had happened and he didn't know after dealing with the cops for the day we tried to figure out what was wrong with the bike and found someone was bothering the carbrator and they were totally off. that was bad, we don't get our licenses until eighteen, but for @ PERSON1 it's twenty-one, it's really bad for him. After that day @ PERSON1 promised that he would never go with @ PERSON1 and me again.

 My family and I would go to our vacation home from time to time to see how things were going. We would spend a few days or a week there. It was fun, we could hang out with our neighbors, ride a quad, feed the rabbits, horses and cows, put on makeup. Sometimes my dad and I would sit on the porch and watch the scenery. The beautiful suset, the trees and their colors. A crowd of roaming deer, preying on the ground, eating the remains of food. The cows walking along the fence wait for dinner to pass their way. While we were sitting there we were chatting about random things or playing jokes on each other and laughing and having a good time. One evening, while we were sitting on the porch, my dad asked me if I wanted to take a walk. I said yes and so we went to the pasture, and somehow he had a camera. We walked and talked and he took a picture of everything. I wasn't looking but suddenly he was taking a picture of me. I looked at him and saw that the camera was facing me and his finger was holding the button and not releasing it. I circled around and laughed so much that I cried and couldn't stop. He kept circling around like me, always taking pictures of me and we were just laughing and laughing.

 Laughs @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 Laughs I think he can tear me away from the terrible crater I'm hiding in. It creates a bubble of joy in the pit of @ CAPS1's stomach and it finally bursts the joy in me. Laughter is like a @ DATE1 day to hear the insects buzzing with the warm breeze, and I know I'm capable of floating in the clouds beard candy, without realizing that I laugh at everything I do . Laughter reverses the dark days of @ CAPS1 and makes me understand all the reasons I need to be happy. The sixth year is a big step in everyone's @ CAPS2. Getting lockers, having more freedom, being able to hang out with older children, and much more. I always dreamed of laughing with the former best friend of @ CAPS1 and giving our numbers to the boys, except that everything changed when she moved. No one spoke to me or hung out with me at school. @ CAPS1's former best friend never left @ CAPS1's side no matter what, so it was uncomfortable walking the crowded halls of a huge school with just a breeze of air next to me. School became unpleasant to go there every day for eight hours. Most sixth graders don't like school because of homework and prefer to socialize with other classmates, but not with me. I felt lonely when other sixth graders (mostly girls) joked about @ CAPS1's appearance or that I always had good grades in school. They stole the projects that I was doing and that I was working very hard on. They also took books, papers, and supplies like pencils and pens. I learned new formulas and facts, but never learned to socialize with other peers. Three-quarters of @ CAPS1's sixth year has passed and I felt lonely as if suddenly the rest of the world has shriveled up and died, or moved very far. At night @ CAPS1's eyes spat out gallons of salt water ripping @ CAPS1's face splashing @ CAPS1 pillows. @ PERSON1 was @ CAPS1 another best friend and never teased or talked to me behind @ CAPS1, but she stuck with the people who did. It overwhelmed me to walk near the group of girls who put others down but hid it with their actions around specific people. They would tell other students rumors about innocent people and how rude and weird they were. I didn't want them telling people rude comments about me so I ignored them as best I could while doing activities on @ CAPS1. A girl from the other primary school noticed the loneliness of @ CAPS1 at school and decided to talk to me. I was shy and felt @ CAPS1's stomach start flipping which was never a good sign. All I could do before I looked like a scared kitten was smile and nod my head. She told me that the next lunch I should come hang out with her and her friends, but these girls were the girls who teased me. The next lunch I went with her, feeling sweaty and nervous the whole time. Once I started telling them about myself, they just smiled and said I was lovely and a really great person, which made me smile from cheek to cheek. It felt good to smile for the first time in a long time. A few days later, the girls told other sixth graders that I was a two-shoe voucher which is terribly boring. @ CAPS1's smile quickly faded once I heard these rumors that spread around the @ CAPS1 classroom like an illness. @ PERSON1 left the girl group one day at lunch to tell me about what had happened. I told her how I felt about what these girls had done to me and how I felt like the world would always agree with anything they said. She confessed to me that she really didn't know why she was hanging out with them in the first place. I was relieved to hear her say those words and that she didn't agree with what this group was saying about me. The girls who spoke badly about me behind @ CAPS1 were left to do whatever they wanted, while @ PERSON1 filled the air on @ CAPS1's side with laughter. Together we laughed about everything that entertained us. Sometimes we even made fun of each other at boring assemblies or a ridiculous person attempting an act that everyone knows they can't do. When she had a bump in the road in @ CAPS2 I backed her up and did what a real friend would do and just laughed at the other person's stupidity just to make her laugh at the situation. In other words, the laughter got me out of the horrible pit of @ CAPS1 I hid in and made me find some real friends from @ CAPS1 in @ CAPS2. Laughter made me forget about bad times and people, and made me realize that when they bring me down, I have a million reasons to laugh until I have to gasp for a sip of air. . Laughter has been a big part of any relationship for me because I can have a good time.

Water @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 We think that laughter is just an emotion, but in reality it is practically a way of life. We use laughter to boost people's morale or to get ourselves out of trouble. People do silly things just to make other people laugh. Personally, I think that laughter is a reason for living, and that everyone needs more of it in their daily life. I've always been the type to make everyone laugh and feel better, and I always put myself in pain just to cheer up someone else. When I was a kid my friend was always bullied at school for no real reason. And I wasn't the type to take action, or try to get revenge on someone. But that all changed when my friend came home covered in food crying before school even got out. She told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and cursed her. So the next day I went to school with her in the morning and took @ CAPS1 filled with chocolate milk, smoothie, egg yolks and curds. When she showed me the girls, I grabbed the ball with chocolate milk and threw it straight at one of them and it hit her in the chest. She started screaming that her clothes were designer, as if someone really cared. I looked at my friends' faces, she was shocked, but I could tell she was trying to hold back her joy because she knew I wasn't done yet. I then threw one with egg yolks in it and put on a girl's hair, her cry was breathtaking. The filled smoothie allowed two of the hugging girls to try and protect themselves (or try to use themselves as a shield), but that wouldn't work with my throws. They started to panic and run towards the others which was a bad idea as they were all crowded together trying to figure out who it was. By the time they realized it was too late, I was already throwing the biggest balloon filled with curdled milk at them and they couldn't get out of there fast enough. It landed between them and exploded when they turned to see what had been thrown. It covered them all and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started to come out of the building to see what it was. I could see all the kids who saw the whole show coming towards me, they started telling me how amazing it was and how funny the girl's reactions were. Some of the children were still on the floor laughing so hard that they couldn't breathe. Some thanked me and told me that these girls had been harassing them for a while. I looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears. She ran over to me and squeezed me so hard I thought the air was going to be forced out of me. It's been ten years since and I still talk to my friend, she even calls me every now and then if she is having trouble with someone at school. As for the girls? I haven't heard from them since they were all transferred to different schools. I guess laughter is the source of all joy in our lives and helps people come together more than ever. My friend still says that it was the happiest day of her life. Some of the other kids who attended the event are going to high school with her now, and all of them ask how I'm doing and want to see me do something like this again. Unfortunately, I had to turn them down and tell them that they had to learn to deal with their own bullies on their own. I imagine some of them found some really creative ways to get revenge on people by straying from what I did.

 Laughter is an essential part of any relationship because it can erase any previous feelings of unease and tends to bring two people together. This phenomenon remains true whether the individuals involved are in the same room, whether they are talking on the phone or even communicating via the Internet. My best friend and I share a special bond where laughter played a big part in keeping us together. Laughter can keep people together even in difficult times. My best friend, @ LOCATION1, is @ CAPS1, and we've shared a lot of laughs over the @ DATE1 years we're friends. We first met while playing an online computer game and immediately enjoyed everyone's comments and comedic statements. We immediately burst into laughter when one of us said something that could be considered even the least bit funny. He and I shared a lot of laughs over the next two and a half years. Recently, her family struggled financially and couldn't pay their internet and phone bills for several months. Work during this time seemed to be more of a burden than usual, as I had few people I could really relax and laugh with. Only the occasional laugh with my friends who live there could make me forget the disappointment I had for missing one of my greatest friends. @ DATE1 Weeks ago there seemed to be some hope that my best friend and I could communicate as before again. While standing @ TIME1 an @ TIME1 doing my homework, I noticed that I had received a message from the long lost @ LOCATION1. I immediately laughed inside, thinking about the good times we had shared a month earlier. Much to my disappointment, the message I received was not to tell me that he had internet at his home again, but to thank me for the gift @ CAPS2 and tell me that he was at another house in friends for @ TIME1. He also mentioned that he would like to play a game or two with me during this time. While this provided any comfort, it did not fully satisfy my thirst for laughter as his computer lacked the drivers that allowed the use of a microphone. This afternoon, although a little disappointing, reminded me of the many good times we had shared together. There is a @ DATE1, my hopes were finally confirmed when @ LOCATION1 texted me that he had internet again. Although we missed being together during the @ DATE1 break, we were delighted to be able to communicate again. I'm glad the @ TIME1 he chose to access the internet was a @ DATE2, because we played and laughed until @ TIME1. The laughter we shared with @ TIME1 washed the disappointment away from both of our minds. My days are over again, as they are now an almost perfect balance between work and laughter. Laughter really brings people together, more than I thought before. Although my best friend and I are thousands of miles apart, when we talk and laugh together it seems he's in the same room as me. Hope one day soon we @ MONTH1 can be in the same room, share laughs and enjoy life. This example is just one of many where laughter greatly improved the outcome of a particular situation, making the individuals involved even closer to each other than they were before.

  Laughter is an important part of my life. The best way to pass the time is to laugh with my friends and family. Think back to all the fun times you had, if you do, you will find that most of them make you laugh. This is because laughter and fun go hand in hand. Everyone loves to have fun, therefore everyone loves to laugh. Laughter is good for you in many ways, it makes you happy, helps maintain healthy relationships with others, and relieves stress. Also a lot of people laugh when they're nervous, I'm one of those people. Especially when you find yourself in a delicate situation. Like when you have to make a speech in front of the class. I remember my first speech in high school, it was one of the scariest things I did. It was @ CAPS1 year and I slumped in my chair and tried to bend down as much as possible so the teacher couldn't see me. I wouldn't make any eye contact with her either. I put my backpack in front of me to block his view. Every time she walked around the room to pick another person, I held my breath and hoped it wasn't me. Whenever it wasn't me, I exhaled in relief. Finally, there were only a few people left and I knew my fate would soon be waiting for me. I decided to take my chances and take a look at my backpack to see who the professor was looking for his next victim. What I saw when I looked at her was that her eyes met mine. I tried to hide behind my backpack again, but it was too late. She had already started shouting my name. What should I do? I said to myself. Do I tell her I'm not ready? Should I try to get out of it? I wiped my sweaty palms on my blue jeans. Then I got up and started walking towards the front of the room. I could feel a nerve knot forming in my stomach. Note card in hand, I began to speak. My words were calm and trembling. My talk was about school uniforms and whether I agree with them or not. As I moved forward I could feel myself starting to stumble over my words. Then I started to laugh, which I always do when I'm nervous. I could hear the other people in the room start to chuckle. I smiled and looked at my note card and continued my speech. After the theaters, I felt a great relief to be done with it. It wasn't perfect, but laughing at myself when I screwed up helped me get through it without breaking down from my nervousness. Although not everyone reacts this way, laughing can help relieve tension in certain situations. But always be careful not to laugh in situations where it's not appropriate. Constant stress is not good for you. Finding something to laugh about can be a great stress reliever. Laughing might not be the right behavior to get an A on your speech, but it helped me keep it together to get it across. Laughter is important for everyone. It's a great way to have fun with others and it makes you happy. Laughter is a great stress reliever. Your relationships will be stronger if you find things in common that you can laugh at. If you learn to laugh you are sure to have a fun and happy life, I know that.

 Laughter is a part of life that doesn't need to be taught. We are all born with the ability to laugh. Laughter and the ability to laugh have been with us from the start, so we don't really think about the importance of laughing. It gives us a feeling of relief, a feeling of joy, and it also brings people together despite barriers like origin or language. I think one of the most important things that laughter does for people is to bring them together. When you meet someone you haven't seen in a long time, or need to be in a group of people you don't know, a little laugh can break the ice and bring you closer. I want to tell about a time I visited my family at @ LOCATION2 that I hadn't seen since I was two years old. My brother and I were the only visitors to our family. So we didn't have our mother there to make us feel comfortable or to introduce people. I was quite worried about being able to communicate with my family in @ LOCATION2 because although I can understand and speak in @ CAPS1, I am not fluent. Being able to bond with the part of my family that I never knew was very important to me and I was worried that the language would prevent it. I was also worried about my brother because he doesn't speak @ CAPS1 at all. On the plane, I thought about how I should introduce myself, what topics to discuss and prepare answers to certain questions. I didn't want the language barrier to create an uncomfortable atmosphere. Finally, it was time to get to @ LOCATION2. We landed at @ ORGANIZATION1, @ LOCATION2 where many of my relatives live. My brother and I collected our luggage and went to pick up our uncles and aunts. We saw them waiting for us and @ CAPS3 waved to us enthusiastically. So naturally we responded with the same enthusiasm. When we first met them, we exchanged hugs and phrases like " Glad to meet you ". @ CAPS3 was very kind to us and welcoming, but still didn't feel like meeting my family. Things were very different and new to us. It was a lot to take for two people with jet lag. The first night we stayed in our oldest uncle and aunt's house. We had dinner together and spoke about our family's situation at @ LOCATION1. It was quite embarrassing. Communicating with elderly parents who cannot speak @ CAPS4 was much more difficult than I thought. The first night passed while I slept in the uncomfortable humidity. The next morning, our uncle and our aunt had planned that we were having dinner with our cousins and other uncle and aunt. I was delighted to meet other members of my family so early, but until then we had to spend the time exploring our new surroundings. My brother and I inspected the house and walked up and down the streets. Immediately we could see the differences from what we were used to. We had a lot of fun coming to terms with the fact that we were in a different country that we knew, but never really experienced. Finally, it was time to meet for dinner with our other parents. We went downtown to @ ORGANIZATION1 and ended up at a restaurant that overlooked the ocean because @ ORGANIZATION1 is right on the coast. I have more to do with my cousins because @ CAPS3 was younger, in CAPS3 @ I am twenty years old, and in general, I hear myself more easily with young people. We gathered in the noisy restaurant and were seated in a separate area for more privacy. As we ordered our food and took in the scenery from the window, I felt more at ease. Our food arrived and we began to eat. While we were eating my cousin started making jokes that made everyone laugh. My brother and I laughed so hard we cried. Throughout dinner there were laughs and smiles. At that point, I really started to feel like @ CAPS3 was my family. I was really grateful to my cousin who started laughing, because without all the laughter I don't think we would have bonded so quickly. It was then that I felt that laughter is very important and brought me closer to the people I love. .

 Everyone knows that when it comes to coaching @ PERSON2 sr. there will always be lots of laughs, giggles, jokes and pranks. If you don't have any of the above issues then you are absolutely lame. It all started when my lovely sister @ PERSON3 decided to go to @ CAPS1 at @ LOCATION2, @ ORGANIZATION2, of course she wasn't going to want to go alone. That's why she brought @ PERSON1, @ PERSON4 and me. We promised ourselves that we were going to make the best of memories. Nothing in the world is better than sharing emotions with those who care about each other. We had arrived at @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION1 on a beautiful morning, we were all a bit tired, but for the most part we were all hungry for sure, that's why the coach took us to @ ORGANIZATION1 so we could buy snacks. He of course ran straight to @ CAPS2.Pepper. This old man must always have one with him, no matter what. Being a cross country trainer and everything, he didn't have a very good influence on his athletes. Anyway, if you are a fan of @ LOCATION3, you know or should know that he never liked when people touched his stuff, especially his @ CAPS2.Pepper ! oh man god forbid you touch his pop. So seeing @ PERSON2 all nervous and bouncy walking down the aisle gave us girls a wonderful idea, we were going to have his @ CAPS2. Pepper, and drink it! ok maybe not drink it, but we were definitely going to get the old man's pop. It's like stealing candy from a baby. We got to the hotel and the coach told us to put our things away so we could tour the place a bit. So while Coach was collecting our room keys, we decided we were going to do a little unpacking for him as well. @ PERSON1 and I took all of his @ CAPS2.Peppers and stuffed them in our bag and acted like nothing had happened. We got our keys and he told us he would stay in bed and unpack the rest of the things we didn't want him to do as he would then realize that we had taken his pop so we immediately ran in. the rooms and threw everything on the floor so we could come back and make him forget about unpacking and we were going straight to the exoeriencing of another of those @ LOCATION3 tours. It wasn't until the night we got back to the hotel and @ PERSON2 hadn't said a single word about his @ CAPS2.Peppers. We thought we were the coolest people ever ! it was already late so we had no choice but to go up to our rooms and stay there. We all thought it was a little lame because none of us girls were tired, not even @ PERSON3, and she ran in the morning. By the way, she was the rebel among us all. The time passed and we were all still awake, we were completely bored and had nothing to do, so we decided to unbox the @ PERSON2 pop. We put them in the spotlight as if they were some precious commodity or something. We thought about drinking them, but it would have been bad. We couldn't leave our room or start a rave so we just decided to hit the sheets and close our eyes because it was going to be a great morning for us the girls and the coach. The second biggest race in @ PERSON3's life was going to take place in the morning, and ... we were still in bed! of course @ PERSON2 got up before everyone else. We were woken up by a loud bang, we thought it would be @ PERSON2 because who else would it be. We opened the door and a big bald old man stood there and said "I'm only going to say this once." I need my @ CAPS2.Pepper. It was so funny that we acted like we didn't know what he was talking about. We found it hilarious because the bald old man was turning beet red, apparently he didn't find it funny. We kind of found out that when he pulled out the @ PERSON3 no run card, we were terrified for our lives !, especially @ PERSON3, because she was the one who was going to run. We played stupid for about five minutes until he got really serious, and then we decided to play nice. Yes, we gave him back his @ CAPS2.Pepper. We learned a very valuable lesson that day : " Getting dirty with @ PERSON2 is like playing with a pig, you both are going to get dirty, but the pig likes it "

 Laughter plays a big role in my life, my family loves to laugh. We always make each other and the people around us laugh. @ CAPS8 you put two or more @ CAPS1 together, someone will start to crack. Sometimes the kids in my family have games to get started @ CAPS4. There's this one @ CAPS2 a few of us are playing; no one has ever given it a name, so we just call it theLaughing @ CAPS2. @ CAPS2 begins with one person standing in front of everyone who is playing. The purpose of @ CAPS2 is to try and get one of the other people to start @ CAPS4, and the first to laugh is to swap places with them to do the same. We really don't play that often as @ CAPS8, there's nothing else to do. One night my two nefuses and I were just sitting looking for something to do @ CAPS8 my little nefue @ PERSON2 said "@ CAPS3 is playing @ CAPS4 @ CAPS2". His older brother @ PERSON1 and I didn't really want to play but there was nothing else to do so we said we would. It all started out as always, no one really wanted to go first, but @ CAPS7 someone finally got up and left. @ CAPS7 it has started. After that everyone was @ CAPS4 and having fun. It went on like this for a while, but after about an hour it started to get bloody. @ PERSON1 and I were planning on getting rid of the board, so we were going to go out, but my little nefue didn't want us to do that. @ PERSON2 went upstairs to take his turn. @ CAPS8 @ PERSON2 got on his way too, he started out as he usually did making silly faces and funny sounds to try and make people laugh. We had seen all of his faces and collected all of his noises, so it wasn't going to work. @ CAPS7 after realizing we weren't going to laugh he started telling us a story. He started the story by saying "@ CAPS6 this guy, that's right, he had nothing but his chair and his box. He loved his chair and his box." The story was not very funny yet, but he followed it. "@ CAPS7 the guy went to bed because he was tired and everything, and @ CAPS8 he woke up, his things were gone. His chair and his box, the only two things he had in this world had disappeared. So he went to get his things. He searched all day and night, but he couldn't find anything but his chair, his box, or even a clue of where they might have gone. he refuses to go to bed and maybe they would be back in the morning as maybe it was all a dream; but @ CAPS8 he woke up he had turned into a boar. " @ CAPS8 he said @ PERSON2 started running around acting like a pig. This got us @ CAPS4 but he didn't want to stop there, he just kept telling his story. In the story, it turned out that every time the "guy" went to bed something strange changed and it just got more and more funny. My family loves to laugh and make others laugh with us. Just like my nefue @ PERSON2, he didn't want to stop telling his story because he made us fall for it. The weather was hanging around and telling a few jokes or making up a @ CAPS2 that we love to laugh about. Lauchter has a big part in my life.

@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 does it know where my wax is for my skin board ? I yelled at my @ CAPS1 as I walked out of my room. I think it's on the book shelf @ CAPS8 but why does @ CAPS2 need it ? "My dad replied. It's for @ PERSON1's birthday present, I don't have one. not @ CAPS4 money for him and I promised him something amazing this year so I'm gonna take him to @ PERSON2 @ PERSON2 and we'll canoe the giant sand dune. buy him a map at the dollar tree ? my @ CAPS1 replied with a look on his face like he was saying @ CAPS8 the dumbest kid I know. @ CAPS2 know I don't take documents @ CAPS1 I do would do @ CAPS4 to work for the money and i don't have enough time @ CAPS4 to work for that and spend time with @ PERSON1 all day long, i mean its his birthday after all and on top of that is more fun I said with a mischievous smile on my visage.Eh well agree, the canoe is already hooked to the truck, responded my @ CAPS1. ppy dog face my sister always for get what she wants. Only if @ CAPS2 stops giving me that funny face, does @ CAPS2 want to drive ? He asked me as we walked out of the door to pick up @ PERSON1. in @ PERSON1's house. As I entered, I hit the wall and two heads turned to look at me. One of my best friends @ PERSON3 a short sandy haired boy with a white face and the other was the birthday boy @ PERSON1 who like @ PERSON3 had the same hair color but had rosy cheeks. Thought i would be ok @ CAPS2 here i said. What is this @ CAPS8 adventure that takes me today, he asked ? @ CAPS2 will see soon enough, I answered now, put on some shorts and get a pair of crappy shows. So, leaving @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON1 to change, I waited outside @ PERSON1's room. Alright, said @ PERSON3, we're ready now, tell us. Not yet I responded with a mischievous smile on my face. @ PERSON1 shouted goodbye to his mom as he closed the door behind us and we walked over to the truck where my @ CAPS1 was still waiting. So @ PERSON1 said to my @ CAPS1 as he got in the backseat, does @ CAPS2 know what @ CAPS8's son is going to make us do today ? Yes, but @ CAPS2 will probably want this one to be a surprise. Well why is there a canoe on top of the truck, is @ CAPS2 going to fish @ PERSON1 ? @ PERSON3 asked as he climbed up next to @ PERSON1. HA I wish my dad laughed as I started his truck. Coming out of the alley of @ PERSON1, I walked over to the bridge and out of town, going straight towards @ PERSON2. Turning into @ PERSON2 I found a parking spot on the other side of an old car and turned off the truck, threw the keys to my @ CAPS1 saying I don't think so that @ CAPS2 will want me @ CAPS4 in my pockets. said to my father. There was only one other person there, a drunken man shaking a bottle of beer and sitting on a log. As I launched the canoe, I threw a paddle to each person and said row on the other side. As we reached the other side, we all jumped up and I pulled the canoe across the sand at the bottom of a huge sand dune. to both of them. Your stupid ones commented together, but they were sad as they started pushing the canoe up the hill. When we got to the top we turned the canoe around and started waxing the bottom in a hurry, then pushed it to a place where it could slide down and all of them jumped in, we slid towards the bottom a bit. before but we stopped. Without another word, me and @ PERSON3 jumped and pushed with running then jumping in, we flew over the sand dune and hit the water with a thud breaking the canoe in half as it hit me. was overturned on a log ten meters away as I saw @ PERSON3 flies off and hits the water with a cannonball while @ PERSON1 has just fallen on its side in the shallows. When I got out I heard the drunk man screaming from across the bank. "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 LE @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 IN @ CAPS7 OF @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 '"

 Have you ever laughed at something someone said and then started laughing louder, not at the joke, but at someone whose laughter was almost more humorous than the joke itself ? Then, were you in a good mood after the funny laugh, when right before that you could have been in the worst mood in the world ? Laughter is the cure for almost everything from a bad mood to crying because you are sad. It can also help make the mood of the room brighter or just make any awkward moment go away. On a bright day @ DATE1, @ PERSON1 called me and asked if I wanted to stay at @ PERSON2 for a long time and have lunch with her. Of course I wanted it because I'm always ready for my typical @ PERSON2 order of a chocolate and malt milkshake and croutons and ranch. I ran to his house down the block and we boarded for a long time at @ PERSON2 downtown @ CAPS1. On the way to @ PERSON2, I shared with @ PERSON1 how I hadn't had a good day so far and how I needed some comfort. She felt the same. When we arrived at @ ORGANIZATION1 we were both excited to sit down so we could catch up with each other and eat. When we walked inside we noticed how crowded it seemed that day as we waited for a table. After we were seated, we noticed an older couple sitting in the cubicle behind us, kids from our school in the cubicle in front of us, and a man and women across the aisle. @ PERSON1 ordered a strawberry milkshake and a burger with fries, and I ordered my usual. After the lady took our order and left, @ PERSON1 and I started telling each other the reasons for our bad mood. She was in a bad mood because her friend @ PERSON3 was not treating her well. I was in a bad mood because my friend @ CAPS2 was mad at me for something that never happened. We were both quite upset and frankly we weren't in the mood for laughing. When all of a sudden we heard what sounded like a mixture of goose horns and donkey bray. We turned to find it was a lady's laugh. I looked @ LOCATION1 and she looked at me and we started to laugh out loud. This lasted about @ NUM1 minutes straight. We both couldn't believe a sound like this could come out of a human's mouth and it was probably the loudest laugh I have ever heard. We also loved that this is all happening in a public place with all these people around, and the lady was getting ready to laugh. @ PERSON1 and I kept laughing at the lady for the way she laughed and it somehow started to ease our bad mood. @ PERSON1 started to smile a little more and as for me, I couldn't stop smiling and laughing. Laughter has an unusual way of putting people in a good mood or relieving them of a bad mood. It doesn't matter if laughter is a normal chuckle or an abnormal sound coming out of someone's mouth, laughter brings people together and it's a great way to turn an awkward moment into a moment to remember. Someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,” and this person knew what they were talking about.

 There are many reasons why laughter is such an important part of any relationship. In my opinion, you can't be serious about everything. Laughing is a way to let go and relieve stress. Laughter also helps to lighten the mood and make people feel more comfortable with each other. Laughter can help in more ways than that. Being serious about everything isn't always a good thing. You have to have fun in your life to stay happy. Being around people who make you laugh is always a good way to put you in a good mood. Laughing is a great way to release the pressure and not be embarrassed. Being able to have a relationship with people where you can laugh at things when they are funny is always necessary. For me, I know that being around people who can't laugh at things always feels like I have to be careful what I say. Laughing is one of the best ways to relax. Laughter also helps to lighten the mood and make people feel more comfortable with each other. If I don't feel like I can joke and laugh with the people I'm with, I usually don't feel like I can be myself. Even if you aren't comfortable with the people you are with to begin with, it may be harder for you to joke around with them. Eventually, if you let go and laugh, you'll feel closer to them. Being happy and laughing with people creates a very strong bond between people. Joking things is a way for many people to not be embarrassed. Usually, if you do something that other people find funny and you don't, then if people are laughing, you might feel uncomfortable. But if you start laughing with them it takes the pressure off you and they don't laugh at you anymore but with you now. In conclusion, there are a lot of things that laughter can do for you. It takes away from having to be serious about everything, relieves pressure and relieves stress. Laughing is one of the best things people can do together to make a connection. Either way, laughing can always put someone in a better mood.

 What is one of the most important parts of a relationship? Laughter would be one of the most important parts of a relationship on my mind. Like my relationship with @ PERSON1 and @ ORGANIZATION1. We are still laughing almost every moment we are together, someone is always making a joke. But when we're all together, the cheers are the funniest, like when our varsity cheers team went to @ LOCATION2. We were locked out of our bus and then kicked out of an @ ORGANIZATION2. Finally we had the funniest @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, that night we will never be forgotten. When we first got to @ LOCATION2 our couch left the keys on the bus after we locked everything. One of the girls noticed it when she went out to get her iPod. We have all tried to think of ways out of this. We first tried putting @ PERSON1 across the window. But unfortunately it didn't work very well because we couldn't open any of the windows. Our couch had to call someone to bring us another set of keys. After the game, our support team went to @ ORGANIZATION2. Because before the game she promised we could go get some cookie dough if we were good and didn't complain about having to sit on the stands and cheer. When I got to @ ORGANIZATION2 @ PERSON1 and got off the bus screaming as loud as I could. One of the people who worked at @ ORGANIZATION2 said we couldn't run around the building. We followed the rules and started wheeling and flaring the hallways instead. We stopped again and they didn't want to wheel or flare the hallways either. as we were walking around to find the music box we came across a baby stroller so we took turns to push ourselves into it. It turns out that this is also not allowed in @ ORGANIZATION2. We were referred to our trainer. Unfortunately for us, we stumbled upon another interesting thing, it was a short little dress on a clothes rack. @ PERSON1 and I put them on our cheer uniforms. As @ PERSON1 was about to take a picture, a girl working there came up behind us. @ PERSON1 the good friend she ran away without telling us. @ PERSON1 decides to take the photo instead, after the lady saw what we were doing we were kicked out. The last crazy event of the night was @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. For the thousands of you who don't know what it is, it's just when a bus stops at a stop light and everyone except the driver of course comes out and runs around the bus. like crazy. We were about to leave @ LOCATION1 when the light turned red. I stood by the door waiting for a light to turn red. I had to beg our couch to let us out as soon as she opened the door, I ran as fast as I could. Unfortunately, the road was all muddy, which made me fall straight on the buttocks. Two other people were behind me and they helped me up and we ran around the bus. But the light turned green as soon as I turned the corner. People behind us were passing and we were honked and not in a good way either. Honestly no body cared, we had so much fun thinking about other people. As @ CAPS7, another girl on the team rounded the corner, she fell directly into his face. Then when everyone was back on the bus, the light turned red again. we waited in the bus for it to turn green. @ CAPS7 and I were covered in mud. Everyone was removing the mud from @ CAPS7 and then I put it on their own. But as everyone was rubbing the mud, it got really dry and uncomfortable. In conclusion, laughter is an important part of a relationship. Without it, our team wouldn't have half the funny memories we have. That night was just one of the funniest of all things that happened that night was so funny. Including being locked off the bus, being kicked out of @ ORGANIZATION2, and best of all @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. That night will never be forgotten by me or by the other people who were there.

 From birth to adulthood, children are cared for by their guardians or parents. It is the responsibility of parents to impart good morals and life skills to their children and to teach them to adapt and flourish in society. @ CAPS24 raising children requires firm and strictly enforced rules. The result of this, however, is that the child leaves their parents ready to live their adult lives outside the home. My knowledge is mainly based on stories that my parents and grandparents passed on to me about their life lessons. Being "in" these small but important pieces of history is quite enjoyable for me. I have to say that while many of the "good old days" facts are great, it is the almost tangible memories that my family connects with laughter that are most important to me. My @ CAPS1 grew up in @ DATE1 living in a small but medium sized house with his @ CAPS1, @ CAPS3 and four siblings. The main subject that is at the center of the stories my @ CAPS1 tells about his childhood comes from memories made at the dinner table. It was the goal of @ CAPS5 (my @ CAPS6), for his children to learn good manners and standard etiquette. The children of @ PERSON3 were expected to practice this by being calm, courteous, and mindful of their physical actions when gathered around the dinner table. For an average, fun, causal, and not-so-dignified @ CAPS7 family, that was a lot to ask. Throughout their childhood, ma @ CAPS1 and her siblings did their best to behave and do what they were told at the table. The one common event that my @ CAPS6 particularly dislikes was when someone spilled their milk. This fateful event happened almost every night. When milk was spilled, it was either because a child was engaged in funny business or because he had gone too far to retrieve the butter dish. Whatever the reason, it was sort of hysterically funny when it happened. The only catch was that laughing at the table was frowned upon as it seemed to break the formal atmosphere the family was looking for during the evening meal. Laughing and spilling milk were two actions not encouraged at the table. Spilled milk hasn't continued to occur as often as children have grown, but that doesn't mean its presence at the table has ceased altogether. One night it wasn't my @ CAPS1 or any of his siblings spilled their milk. Instead, it was my @ CAPS6. When the initial incident happened, the whole family was in shock. In an effort to clean up the mess, everyone donated their napkins, while their @ CAPS3 maintained a controlled but unhappy demeanor. When everything was cleaned up the family continued with their meal and on my @ CAPS6's face there was a subtle but unequivocal smile. Years later, my @ CAPS1 (@ PERSON4), @ PERSON1, @ CAPS15 @ CAPS16, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON2 @ CAPS17 have grown up, married and some have even started their own families. Most of the @ CAPS1 family live at @ LOCATION2, so they enjoyed coming to visit their @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS3 (my @ CAPS21 and @ CAPS6) while on vacation or whenever they could. In these times when the whole family can come together here at @ LOCATION1, there is hardly ever a dark or serious time at the table. As my @ CAPS3 would say, "@ CAPS24 we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs." I attribute the pleasure we have together to this bond of love that binds us all together, and I think it wouldn't be as important without the element of laughter. I feel that my @ CAPS6 (who is now in Heaven with @ CAPS21), has achieved the goal of preparing his children for life. Now that they're all grown up, they can let go, enjoy each other's company, and feel free to laugh out loud even if there's a risk someone will spill their milk.

 Laughter leads to happiness. Happiness is a key to life. Laughter is a communication trigger with life, it brings you a warm feeling inside @ CAPS1 you are laughing. Think about it. For example, @ CAPS1 you are going on your first date with this wonderful guy that you are so excited but yet nervous because you have no idea how he is going to act. You have all these thoughts going through your mind, will he like what I'm wearing? Will he think I'm beautiful? What am I talking about ? and trust me, i bet you he thinks exactly the same things you do. You arrive at the restaurant and he's a gentleman, he pulls out your chair for you and comes out as gentle as he can be. The first thing it does is make you laugh. Laughing really changes things, doesn't it? makes you feel you know comfortable. Now let's take it back. You introduce yourself with a guy, he says, "hello", you sit down and he talks about the most boring topics, doesn't smile, speaks rather calmly, gets you to bring up all the topics you want to talk about. A couple of witches do you think it's more likely to move forward? The first example, isn't it? laughter lights up any smile makes people happy and comforts. laughter and smiles i know are in the same category i mean @ CAPS1 you smile you are happy. @ CAPS1 you laugh you have to smile and usually @ CAPS1 you laugh you are happy about something or someone. i like the people of @ CAPS1 make me laugh and smile, it looks like everything is going to be okay, @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1 it is not. people don't realize that part of communication is smiling and laughing, they kinda ignore it and come like, well, you know, a boring witch makes a person no fun at all. Everyone should have joy in their life, and if not, there are people who can help. Do you notice the dark people? Are people who are sad all the time afraid of life? Maye went through a lot of tough times. My God, I can't even imagine what some people are going through these days, but the smile lights their hearts anyway. Makes them feel maybe not much but better than they did. just passing a face showing that you don't know them but maybe you can feel he's not okay, or in pain. I work in a restaurant in my town here at @ LOCATION1 as a waitress. I love my job and I like making people smile and laugh, it makes them feel comfortable. This lady walked into my job and it was late afternoon. She looked around at all the other customers, but it wasn't the people who were sitting here with sisters or brothers, even children. It was the couples that she was watching, she looked very unhappy and it seemed to me that she was probably divorced or broken up, she just looked very sad. knowing me all I wanted to do was help her put a smile on her face because I care. I went to her table and set over here, remember I don't even know this lady. I looked at her and said "you know it's gonna be alright" and smiled at her. In seconds, her face lit up, it was as if the whole restaurant had lit up. She put a smile on her face. You know it's the little things in life that make everything great.

 When I think of laughter, I think back to the wonderful years. Although the memories are hazy, I still remember the times when I believed friendship had no end and laughter was the common remedy in every battle. Thinking back to @ DATE2 I was twelve years old, I remember the adventures of @ CAPS7 which took me to the sky. Free-spirited and devoid of reality, I was an unstoppable soul. I was however @ CAPS2 alone. Through adventure and exploration I have brought @ CAPS7 a trustworthy opponent. Her name was @ PERSON1 and she was @ CAPS7's best friend. @ PERSON1 lived in the country, where the grass grew tall and the land spanned acres. Through forests and streams you might find our refuge from the world; We called @ CAPS3 our wonderland. Now the little stream with a bridge is just a forgotten place. On a typical @ DATE1 @ TIME1 at @ DATE3, I drove to @ PERSON2 to @ PERSON1's house. As I walked through her front door, I automatically smelled the scones of cinnamon scones freshly drizzled with honey. The sweet smell made @ CAPS7's spine shiver. @ PERSON1 came down the stairs and greeted me with a hug. She wore her long black hair in braids and wore a white summer dress. Her shimmering brown skin glistened against the sunlight and her dark brown eyes gave me a happy look. I envied him with @ CAPS7 heart and soul. Next to her, I was just the simple, blonde girl with a blotchy complexion. In an instant, she ran to the window and stared at the perfect blue ski. "@ CAPS1 wow, finally @ DATE2 has arrived," she whispered then exploded, "@ CAPS2 another day spent with cranky, sleepless peers and no more stuffy classrooms or boring teachers. @ CAPS6 ..it's the first day of many ! ” We burst out laughing as I laughed at her poetic outburst, but we both knew every word of @ CAPS3 was true. With a sigh, I gazed at her breathtakingly, got dressed one last time, and ran to the field in her garden. @ PERSON1 grabbed a red cardigan and followed me, holding a basket in her hand as if she was Little Red Riding Hood. I scampered around the meadow as if I were a radiant fox running after his prayer. When I stopped to breathe, I encountered the wind blowing over the tall, vaporous grass in rhythmic movements around me. Running to our secret location, I only looked back once to find @ PERSON1. As I turned to the @ CAPS7 destination again, a branch encountered @ CAPS7's vision and painfully knocked me over. Blood was running down @ CAPS7's chin and leaving droplets of crimson blood in the green grass. I breathed in, choking on the salty liquid, then realized she was standing there. Like a worried hare, @ PERSON1 jumped over to @ CAPS7 and helped me get home. We made our way to the upstairs bathroom. Standing in front of his bathroom sink, I cried small tears. In the mirror, I could see a belligerent-looking girl with a bloody gash on her chin and red, foggy eyes. The pain was @ CAPS2 @ CAPS4 made me cry; @ CAPS3 was the appearance of @ CAPS7 that had put me off. People were asking for days “@ CAPS4 is on your face” and “@ CAPS5! How did that @ NUM1 come over to @ CAPS7's side and squeal,“ @ CAPS6, how are you doing? ”@'S face? CAPS7 turned into a bright shade of red in a way I could explode. I turned to @ PERSON1 and with a smooth breath I burst, "@ CAPS8 ! Marvellous! Ecstatic! Before that, I had a simple, boring look. Now I will look even worse with this terrible flaw ! I hate how beautiful you are @ PERSON1. You are exotic, distinguished and everything about you looks extremely perfect ! "@ CAPS7's friend was just standing there and listening to every word. A look of confusion spread over her face but slowly transformed into a smirk. Suddenly @ PERSON1 burst out laughing. Embarrassed, I walked to the door wanting to leave right now, but she fell silent and looked at @ CAPS7's arm. Shaking her, I continued down the stairs. " @ CAPS10 ", she yelled at me," I am @ CAPS2 agree with you anyway. @ CAPS6, you @ MONTH1 have a little cut on your chin, but you have always been beautiful and I just feel like a simple field mouse next to you. The way your thin blonde hair turns into perfect curls and the way your freckles highlight your amazing turquoise eyes. I've always been jealous of you! That's why I'm laughing! "I understood that for a second, then I burst out laughing. Running up the stairs, I came up to her with a big bear hug and laughed a little. more. Everything I had ever thought about her good looks and mine was irrelevant at all. Thinking about this, the pain of the @ CAPS7 haircut became apparent to me. Lee, her dad, m 'arranged with her sewing skills and every stitch I laughed with @ PERSON1 to get through the Seven stitches and an ugly scar remind me everyday laughter gets you through the worst while @ CAPS3 builds an eternal friendship.

 The wind picked up and fell, whipping against the side of the house with all its might. My mother said she had never seen such a severe storm in her life. It shook the house, causing it to crack in weird places, like the planks on the floor. My @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1 was sitting at the kitchen table, contemplating, worried. They had rented houses on acres surrounded by trees, the ground was so soft, so saturated with the rain and flood that had engulfed the valley. There were already hundreds of uprooted trees, there were bound to be more. The small farms that relied on @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1 including my father's were well-built, weathered farmhouses, most surrounded by hundreds and hundreds of acres of land. You would be surprised to find someone with less than @ NUM1 acres of land. These are mostly wheat fields, but you can easily find corn fields, alfalfa fields, you will find rows and rows of blueberries so big that only @ NUM2 can fit on the palm or on your hand. It is literally heaven on earth, a little slice of heaven that was thrown to earth by accident or on purpose. The sun is so bright and the sky is the clearest and sharpest blue. When the time comes in the form of clouds fluffy Giants, the sky seems spotted pieces of cotton giants. It is all spread over such flat terrain that you wonder if it could be real. I have spent so many wonderful, laughing summers there. Running barefoot through the fields, playing in the large expanse of lush green grass. Feed the goats, chickens and pigs with my siblings. On @ DATE1 my mom said she had never seen a place so beautiful become so ugly in such a short time. My mom says if she had known what was going to happen that day, she would never have let them get in that car. My daddy, @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 @ PERSON2 pulled out of the aisle. Since it was a small car, my @ CAPS2 volunteered to ride in the back. The storm had been showing its vicious temper for over two hours and she was showing no signs of easing. They had left to see what damage had been done to their acres of land, to see what needed to be fixed once this storm had moved over the mountains. There is no explanation, no one understood why my @ CAPS3 left without even a scratch on its body. No one knows how the tree fell or why it only landed in the back of the car, but it does. The hand of God had come down and caused destruction. My @ CAPS2 was killed instantly, my dad was seriously injured but alive. He spent weeks in the hospital, during those weeks the news of the accident spread like wildfire like the news in a small town. Everyone loved my @ CAPS2, it was a social butterfly that fluttered from person to person, laughing, talking, sharing tears and joy. She knew everyone, and everyone knew her. The heavens cried and howled that day, the raindrops fell so heavily that it was as if the whole world was crying, crying just for you to share your grief. It hurts to lose someone so dear to your heart. My daddy cried, he sobbed until he didn't have the strength to feel any emotion. he loved her so much, he needed her. Lightning struck the giant oak tree which stood tall and proud in my daddy's garden that day. It was the same tree that bore my grandparents' initials. Lightning split the top of the giant oak tree in two. Everyone saw it as a symbol, a sign of how my daddy and @ CAPS2 had been separated quickly and forcefully. But, a few days before my dad came home from the hospital, my dad climbed that giant oak tree and chained the cut part together. With this, my father made his own symbol, saying that you will always be together, but not physically, but that you will never be truly apart. The day my dad got home he saw the giant oak tree, and for the first time in weeks, a glimmer of understanding shone in his eyes. A little hope had settled into everything again. Her funeral was a beautiful affair, elegant, simple, beautiful, just like her. The whole town came, they remembered for hours, telling stories about my @ CAPS2 and its crazy but adorable nature. Then from across the room he came. Small at first, then stronger and stronger. To laugh. A smile, yes there were tears with that laughter, but it was laughter anyway I have never seen the saying "laughter is the best medicine" better do justice. My @ CAPS2 was a person who saw laughter, love, faith and hope as basic necessities in life. She brought joy to so many people, and now they were returning the favor to her.

 When we were little he would watch @ CAPS1. In college, it was seeing a kid squirting milk through his nose. But now that we are nearing our high school years, we stifle laughter, suppress outbursts, and laugh until we cry, for our own reasons ; and we can't hold back the inevitable urge to laugh. Some say that laughter is the best medicine, unfortunately for my sister and I it was not; laughter just got us into more trouble. No matter how many times we were lectured, someone always found their way into the other's room just because we were curious. I remember a few summers ago I saw @ PERSON1, my sister, put a bag of chocolate under her mattress. There was a possibility he was gone, but I had no doubt in my mind that he was still there. But as the mattress was lifted and I started to grab it, the bed was pushed back down, almost crushing my fingers. there was @ PERSON1 with a vindictive look in his eyes and two hands placed on his hips. What can I say? "What could I do?" An unmoved cry escaped my lips and I rushed for the door before she could unleash her anger on me. Up the stairs, around the sofa, through the kitchen, I ran; but not fast enough. Before I could lock myself in the bathroom, she grabbed my ponytail and pulled hard. I was in the game for a nine year old kid who was tearing his hair out, all @ CAPS2 beaten up. But luckily no more harm could be done because my @ CAPS4 heard my cry and came to investigate. Fighting was taboo in our house, but it never stopped us. @ CAPS4's punishments were tiny, we could kiss and make up, or stand in a corner. The anger in @ LOCATION1's eyes was already gone and a certain meaningful smile was playing on his lips. @ CAPS4 was still trying to play the strict parent, but for us the past four minutes was just a joke now. "@ CAPS3", she had said, one word, one meaning, that's all it took. We exploded into a roar of laughter and laughter. While there is no way @ CAPS4 could have known, we didn't want to be disrespectful, but we couldn't be silent. Loud laughter echoed in the hallway, so loud that @ CAPS4's words were inaudible. As we grabbed our hands and pulled us towards the living room, we were half dragged because we were shaking too hard. We stood ten feet apart, our eyes fixed on the ninety degree angle in front of our noses. But one glance at each other and sent another quiver of laughter through our tiny bodies. We could have been drunk if you hadn't done better now, but in reality we were just two rowdy kids playing. We all have our reasons to laugh. Maybe your reason is as simple as reading an email that made you laugh so much that you cried. Maybe it's because my amateur writing style is a joke for you, or maybe you've just seen a child's nose spit up chocolate milk. We all have things in our lives that make us want to roll on the ground or slap our knees; but in my experience it is extremely difficult to hold back so just let it out.

When my friend @ PERSON2 and I went out with our friends from @ LOCATION1. We knew how we would get there but we didn't know how we were going to come back but knowing each other we didn't care, we just wanted to have fun. we had a lot of fun hanging out, but then it started to get dark, we needed a ride home. Later, I decided to call my dad to see if he would come pick us up. Knowing my dad he thought it was really funny that my friend and I were stuck at @ LOCATION1 so he started to laugh. After he was laughing again I asked then can you come and get us because it is pitch dark and he said no because it is not his fault that I was stuck there. So @ PERSON2 said "why don't I call my dad to see if he would" and she did, but just like my dad he also started laughing and said no . Later, @ PERSON2 and I ran out of people to call. So we thought why not worry about him later, it's really not that dark and we can all hang around a little longer. After thinking about this throw I knew we had to start worrying because later it would get even darker than it already was and we sure wouldn't get home. So I told @ PERSON2 that we should keep trying people out while we hang out more with our friends, but she didn't really care. I called my sister @ PERSON1 to see if she would do me the favor of picking us up at @ LOCATION1. I called her and I called her but she didn't pick up her phone. An hour later and we still couldn't think of anyone but then I thought maybe my other sister @ CAPS1 was doing me a favor, called her and asked her if she could and she did said yes i would be there in @ NUM1 minuets to pick you up. So I went to tell @ PERSON2 the good news that I brought us home and we don't have to worry about it anymore. When I got back to the park she was no longer there I thought she was going to the bathroom so I went to check the bathroom for her but she wasn't there either. I thought to myself where she could go. I started to really worry about her leaving, so I walked around and looked for her. So I looked at my clock and saw my sister was going to be there in ten minutes, before I realized she was at the store buying some food and she didn't tell me. I got really mad at her for not telling me where she had gone but I thought it didn't matter so why was I going to make a big deal out of it and then I heard someone 'a beeper and it was my sister @ CAPS1 I was really happy to see her because all I thought about was coming home and sleeping all night and all day. We got in the car and my sister asked why I hadn't called my dad for a ride? I told him yes, but he wouldn't come and get me because if I could come here then why can't I come home. She started to laugh at me and thought it was the funniest thing my dad ever did. After ditching my friend @ PERSON2, we went to eat at Burger King and had two salads to go. When I got home my dad asked who brought me and I told him my sister picked me up and took me out to eat. After being stuck @ LOCATION1 so long and have had no way to get it, I just went to my room and I went to my bed because it was a very long day for me and my little porous feet. The next morning I woke up only to @ NUM2 in @ TIME1. My dad thought I had to wake up already so he went to my room and woke me up and told me I had to eat and get some fresh air. I woke up, took a shower, ate some food, and took a very short walk because my feet were still hurting from yesterday. when I went for a walk, I thought about how I should not just go @ LOCATION1 not sure I get home, but I was very grateful that my sister has done everything possible to come to me look and not get angry or even yell at me. When I got home I called my sister and told her I was really grateful that she would pick me up and my friend and even take me out to eat.

It was a normal sunny day in the hills of @ ORGANIZATION1. The sun was shining and shining on the cove that I, my twin brother and my best friend were swimming in. The cove was fantastic. It was a deep swimming hole that all the kids in the neighborhood swam in. Since all the other kids were either too old and busy to swim or too young, it was only the three of us who swam in the creek this @ DATE1. We liked it. It helped us cool off during the heat of the day. We would play games like @ PERSON1 and tag in the water. There was even a rope swinging across the little bridge that one of the bigger ones had made. The swimming hole was the perfect location for this @ DATE1. Eventually we got hungry and tired of swimming in the hole for a while. There was this trail that we used to walk home. The trail was the fastest way home. From the trail you could see farm animals grazing in the sunny fields. The day we hiked this trail was a little different than normal. All the farm animals were making noise. One of the farm workers was walking the path listening to a bell. He said one of his goats had come out. He warned us that the goat was a bit mean and if we saw her to keep our distance. So we took the warning and moved on. Once we reached the gravel road that leads to my house, @ PERSON2 said she heard the bell. My brother and I didn't believe her at all. We thought she was playing another joke on us. We walked for about @ NUM1 seconds. All of a sudden @ PERSON2 screamed to run ! My brother and I turned around and saw the white goat with the big horns chasing us ! We ran as fast as we could. I tripped on my feet and fell. I got up as fast as I could and sprinted faster. I could tell my adrenaline was going up because I was running really fast and not getting tired. We reached the hot wire fence that surrounds my house. We all stopped and wondered if we could jump over it or not. The goat was getting closer and closer, we didn't have much time to choose how much time we could or not. My brother was the first to jump. Of course he did, just like @ ORGANIZATION2. I was the last. I started to panic in my head. I backed up a bit, ran, and jumped over the fence. Thought I was going to make it but my foot grabbed the fence and I threw over the fence and the face planted it. It was super embarrassing. My friend and my brother both laughed at me. I could tell my face was red and I was crazy for falling. Again. Although I always found myself laughing. The goat had stopped at the fence and started charging it with its horns. It made me jump and run. I dove over a row boat where my brother and my friend were and said oh my lanta this was the funniest and scariest thing I had experienced at @ DATE1 . We walked over to the house laughing and talking about each other's faces as we ran and how funny it was that my face had planted it. They laughed at the face I made when the goat started to charge the fence. Even though I was embarrassed that I tripped over the fence, I still found myself laughing and making fun of myself for what had happened. I have to say it was the best day ever @ DATE1. We went up to my house and went into the kitchen to find my mom laughing so hard she was crying. We all asked her what was so funny and she said she saw it all out the window. We all started laughing to the point that we all cried. We all told the story to our parents when they all came to dinner and they laughed and laughed. All of our cheeks hurt at the end of @ TIME1. Laughing is great. He repairs the soul. Plus, it's a great abs exercise !!!!

       Laughter in a Relationship The most important thing in a relationship is laughter. Laughter is something we all need and it keeps us going with the world and the tasks we do all day because we often get frustrated. So one thing that helps us is laughter. If someone is upset, they can watch a comic movie or read a comic book about funny or humorous characters. But a lot of people like to talk to someone when they are upset and need support from them. When I was once upset with my schoolwork and not having a job. I went out for a walk after an argument with my mom at work. About my notes that were dropped. My mom was very angry and my dad was also very angry with me because they knew I was much more capable than what I was showing in my notes. My parents knew I wanted to do a job to buy things that I wanted. They didn't think it was appropriate to dwell on having a job and not worrying about my grades. When I was walking by the lake, I heard someone play the guitar and he was playing it so well that I wanted to meet this person. at once. I tried to find him but couldn't and finally I sat down and wondered who this person could be. So all of a sudden a boy came up to me with a guitar and asked me what time it was. I told him the time and asked him where he had learned to play the guitar so well. So he told me that he had been interested in playing guitar for a long time and wanted to join a band . after this meeting, we became close friends and we met every day. He knew I was pretty tense so he played guitar for me and we sang songs together. He also told me jokes and I knew he was doing it all just for me and sometimes I would just shut up and not respond to his jokes. He became more tense that I wasn't laughing or smiling. But I didn't know that by doing this, I was doing it really badly. But he never gave up on me and he kept telling me funny stories and we talked on the phone all night long just so he could make my tensions a little worse. less and make me laugh. So one day he took me to lunch at @ ORGANIZATION1 because he knew it was my favorite place and I loved going there. He took me to see a comedy about superheroes but none of them made me laugh. The whole time I was just in his arms. But after the movies he took me to the most beautiful place and it was near a beach and the whole place was decorated with colored lights and we were sitting on a swing and talking. Now he knew how he could make me happy and he told me jokes and we read comics and surprisingly I started to like his jokes and the comics we read. Every time I met him he was doing something special for me and making me laugh. He once dressed up as a clown and tried juggling balls but he couldn't do it as well and I laughed at him so much. I know it was rude to laugh at him, but I loved spending time with him. One day he came to my house and we were talking and he held my hand and offered to me. I was really happy to hear that and he brought me the most beautiful ring ever. He offered and took me for a drive and gave me some advice in a very respectful manner, not with the intention of demeaning me. But I had never seen a person like him and he told me that laughing and smiling is good for life. No matter what happens tomorrow, why should we care about it today when we have such a great life ahead of us. We have to live the way we want to and not force ourselves to change just to get serious in life. He held my hand and took my arms and said @ CAPS2 no matter how much we love each other, but laughter is important in a relationship. I looked at him and asked him why? So he replied that we should be happy and be healthy and be together. After we spent some time there he dropped me off at the house and told me to live the life because who knows if we will be alive tomorrow. From that moment I realized that he was right and I looked at life from a different perspective than that day and decided to live life in a better way so that I laughed and that I take advantage of.

 I loved hermit crabs. The cute little creatures hiding in their shells fascinated me. When I was about six my family decided to take a road trip along a coastline @ CAPS1. We were accompanied by another family with four children. Together there were @ NUM1 kids to play with, but the closest to my age was @ PERSON1. He was only a few years older than me. I loved @ PERSON1. We explored, swam, laughed and played tricks on our siblings together. Everything he did, I did. We've been to so many different beaches that I can't remember half of them, but one in particular stood out. It was a short, slender beach. On one side there was a cave. The cave was loaded with hermit crabs. Never in my life have I seen so many. There were mini hermit crabs, very big hermit crabs and even more big hermit crabs! It was as if our dreams had come true. @ PERSON1 and I have created sandcastles, prisons and water canals to contain hermit crabs. Our older brothers and sisters were not at all interested in them. It didn't matter, in our eyes it only meant more to us! When it was time to go, @ PERSON1 and I were devastated. We both knew we wouldn't stumble upon another beach like this it's the future. We finally figured out that we wouldn't be able to keep our beloved crabs. We stood on the beach near the cave for hours saying "goodbye" to each other. When my mom finally yelled across the beach saying it was time to go, we both made a quick decision. I had already seen girls stuffing seashells in their swimsuits. I thought why not? @ PERSON1 liked the idea, so we silently slipped two hermits into our swimsuits. His crab in his shorts pocket, mine in my one-piece swimsuit. He was sagging at the bottom, but I decided to ignore him and pretend nothing had happened. Guilt hung over my gaunt little body, as if I had put a ten-pound rock in my costume, not a tiny crab. My mother asked me directly if I had left all the hermit crabs on the beach. I nodded, but my voice was missing. Back on the road, my sister and I played word games. Everything was fine, the music was playing, my parents were talking. and our wheels rolled on the narrow dirt road. Every now and then I had to move around a bit because I could feel my little hermit crab checking its surroundings. We had been driving for about an hour when I let out a bloodcurdling cry. When my dad slammed on the brakes, dust swirled around the car like a hurricane. I remember my mom pivoting in her seat to look at me and ask me what was wrong. I did not answer. As the pliers gripped again, I let out another urgent cry. So I decided it was time to stop hiding my boyfriend in the bottom of my swimsuit. Letting out the last prolonged cry, I pointed my finger at my crotch. My sister's squeezed hands took off my swimsuit and quickly found the little devil. I was so embarrassed and guilty my mom just laughed. She said that I had already received my punishment for lying and that she thought I had learned my lesson. I certainly wasn't going to disagree on that. A few minutes later, our friends also stopped. When we asked if everything was ok, they said with a laugh that one of the girls got caught by @ PERSON1's hermit crab. It made us all laugh. We never stopped laughing at this story. My family loves to humiliate me in front of friends, guys I love, or adults I don't even know. Every time my mom said this crab got hooked "where it counts" we all burst out laughing. And every time I turn tomato red from embarrassment, but I guess I deserve it. @ PERSON1 and I both learned our lessons, although I think I learned a few more lessons. First of all, never put animals near your "sensitive" parts. The second lesson was not to lie, because you will likely end up getting caught and punished. The last lesson should be to learn how to enjoy something when you have it and when it's time to let go, let go of anything, and be grateful for the time you spent enjoying it. If I could have just said goodbye to my husky friends, I would never have lied or felt so much pain. They were all great lessons to learn, and I am very grateful to them. Not only because I've become a little wiser, but also because I have a great story to tell that always makes people laugh.

 Laughter is an integral part of life. Or that's what I believe and grew up with. "A day without laughter is a day wasted." The quote from @ CAPS1 has greatly influenced my life. As well as the people in my life. My mother is quite the entertainer. People told her that she should become an actress. Apparently our family stories are a lot of fun. Mainly because they involve my brother in one way or another. He is adventurous, spontaneous and not afraid of anything. Sometimes his decisions aren't the smartest. Most of the stories my mom talks about date back to when my brother was little. She loves to talk about one in particular. When my brother was younger he liked to participate in adrenaline-based activities. Like extreme rollerblading, cycling and skateboarding. He would try to do all the tricks in the book and then some. @ CAPS1's story, however, does not include that he got hurt or someone else got hurt. Which is surprising because it seemed like every day he would hurt himself or his best friend @ CAPS2. When I was about eight or nine, putting my brother at eleven or twelve, we were at one of my football games. My brother had to go to the bathroom and when he came back my mother was not happy. He went to use the port-o-pot and he had just received two new shirts; a white t-shirt to wear under a new button fastening. It was a hot afternoon, so he took off his new white t-shirt but kept the button down. Unfortunately, he dropped the white shirt. He dropped it in the rancid and disgusting excrement. If @ CAPS4 asks her, it was an accident and my mom wasn't happy about it. My mother is the laughing person in the family. I think about his words of wisdom all the time : “@ CAPS3 when it seems like nothing can get better, think about the positive aspects in your life and laugh. Because that's really all @ CAPS4 can do. @ CAPS4 embarrasses you in front of a lot of people @ CAPS4 need to laugh about it. If @ CAPS4 can laugh about it, it won't matter if someone else does. " @ CAPS4 has to be through life in one way or another. Might as well make the best of it, and laughter really is the best. It improves my mood and makes me feel right at home. There are a lot of stories about what my brother did, or how blonde I am. But ultimately, all that matters is that we can laugh about something every day. It brings us closer. "A day without laughter is a day wasted."

 Laughter is what connects me @ PERSON1 my friends. This is a very important aspect in any type of relationship. I know almost all the memories I have are of my laughing friends, @ PERSON1 we have been friends for a very long time. One of my favorite funny memories is when me @ PERSON1 two of my friends went to @ LOCATION1 @ PERSON1 stopped in @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION2 ... We had a hard time getting out. Me @ PERSON1 my friends, @ PERSON1, went to @ LOCATION1 to do a cultural performance at @ ORGANIZATION1. When we were done, we started to come home. @ PERSON1 kept complaining about having to use the toilet. Her dad told her to wait until we got to @ LOCATION2 so we could stop somewhere. @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 I suggested @ ORGANIZATION2. By the time we got there @ ORGANIZATION2 was doing the pot dance. @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 I stood in line to order ice cream cones dipped in chocolate. While we were waiting, @ PERSON1 was looking for the toilet. After about four minutes of searching, @ PERSON1 finally asked the lady who worked behind the counter where the bathroom was. She handed @ PERSON1 a key with a large bulky wreath attached @ PERSON1 told her it was outside behind the building. @ PERSON1 took the key @ PERSON1 sprinted towards what appeared to be double dorrs. @ PERSON1 didn't know that only the left door opened. She ran straight into the right door @ PERSON1 fell. we all started to laugh ... Especially @ PERSON1. She laughed so much that she didn't quite make it to the bathroom. Instead, she had an "accident" on the floor in @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION2. When you can laugh with your friends about things that might not seem like fun to others, like getting wet in public, it only strengthens your friendship. Laughter is a huge, important benefit in any kind of relationship. It strengthens the relationships you already have @ PERSON1, it also helps to create new ones.

                       My @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 was warm, @ DATE1 @ TIME1 in @ LOCATION3, @ LOCATION1. The stars were out and there wasn't a cloud to see. As usual on weekends, most of the family were there; as well as some friends. I was just a little girl who loved everything and everyone, especially laughing. Anyone could make me laugh, smile and have a good time. One person, however, could make me laugh for hours at a time. This person was my @ CAPS1. My @ CAPS1, @ PERSON1, came to spend some time with the rest of the family and friends who were at my house. He was talking, laughing and having a great time. Of course, I was only five or six at the time; but for me other than my dad my @ CAPS1 was the coolest person in the world. This @ TIME1, I was playing with my friends and not really paying attention to all the adults. All of a sudden my @ CAPS1 came up to me, gave me a big hug and started talking to me. I was so happy. Since I loved to joke and laugh, I was delighted to have all the attention. I used to call them laughter attacks. Whenever my @ CAPS1 spoke to me I would start laughing and laughing so hard I couldn't stop. This @ TIME1, I had one. My @ CAPS1 and I were joking and making fun of each other. Then, out of nowhere, I realized that I was laughing so hard that I had a stomach ache. @ CAPS2 lasted about an hour straight. It was long after my @ CAPS1 left and returned to adults. My friend, @ LOCATION2, sat down next to me and tried to stop me from laughing. She laughed too, but not as much as I did. Finally, after a long hour or so, I calmed down. The rest of @ TIME1 was great but every now and then I started laughing again. There was absolutely no way I would stop laughing until I went to bed. After a long @ TIME1 having a great time, everyone left and went home. When my @ CAPS1 came to say goodbye, I was upset that he was leaving, but I knew I would see him again. The next day, I was right to be able to stop laughing. I always smiled and hung out with my family, but I didn't laugh uncontrollably. My @ CAPS1 was and still is a big part of my life. He is always the person who can make me laugh and forget all my worries. Even though I no longer live near him, I can still talk to him on the phone, laugh and joke with him. When I go to visit him at @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS2 looks like we're picking up where it left off. We don't even think about the fact that we haven't seen each other for a very long time. When my dad passed away my @ CAPS1 was still there for me. He is the only male figure I still have in my life. After everything I've been through, I could always count on him to brighten up the mood and make me laugh, or at least smile. People really need someone like my @ CAPS1 in their life. @ CAPS2 really helps knowing that you have someone who loves you and can brighten up your day. All you have to do is talk to him. My relationship with my @ CAPS1 is very close, and the only thing that has kept @ CAPS2 like this is all the laughs we've shared over the years. Laughter is an integral part of anyone's life. I grew up around laughter and the idea of always being happy. Throughout my life, I have had to deal with pain, loss and sadness. However, after everything I've been through, I can still come out laughing. When I was eleven, my father passed away. Even younger, my parents divorced. No matter how much these things hurt me, I never stopped laughing and moving forward in my life.

                             laugh @ CAPS1 funny, normally when I drop in line, for some reason @ CAPS1 humorous to me. I laughed in my head the hole in a quick. I have caught alot of battered whales that I have kayaked, @ CAPS2 I think my day running the top stretch of white salmon could have been my worst beat down yet. I like to call this day the beaten @ CAPS5. @ CAPS4 was a really nice day and I felt like @ CAPS4 would just be a normal day on superior white salmon, @ CAPS2 oh I was wrong. The bad news started as soon as @ PERSON3, @ PERSON2 and I parked the car. @ PERSON3 had brought the wrong size spray skirt for her creek boat. I had no doubt that we could overcome this problem. the spray skirt ended up barely fitting, @ CAPS4 took the strength of the three of us to put @ CAPS4 on. After a long hike in the bed of an empty stream, we found ourselves at the entrance. This is a fairly straightforward setup, you start by finding a weak spot on a @ NUM1 foot rock slide. after finding your spot you simply glide along the boulder and drop seven feet into the water. Unfortunately @ CAPS4 was not that easy for me, I slid along the boulder and fall perfectly fine @ CAPS2 I had no idea I hadn't put on my spray skirt all the way so when I fell in the water about a gallon or so rushed into my boat. I didn't think much about @ CAPS4 because @ CAPS4 was only a gallon. I actually thought @ CAPS4 was pretty funny and it made me feel good because that day I was paddling a big boat for my size so I thought @ CAPS4 would help distribute my weight a bit . There I didn't empty my boat and we just started paddling downstream. The early rapids weren't a big deal. I dug all the holes and felt like I was doing well because @ CAPS4 had been a time scene when I had paddled this stretch. We were halfway through our run when I was starting to realize how gnarled this river was, I was riding all the rapids I could and laughing every time, @ CAPS2 I couldn't stop, there was no way out of this canyon, we had at least @ DATE1 foot walls on either side of us, the only way out was downstream ! We were nearing the end of our trip and we only had one big drop left to conquer @ CAPS2. @ CAPS5 Falls, a footfall @ NUM2 (depending on who you ask) of pure white water. this drop is not like any ordinary waterfall, in fact this drop is not really like a waterfall, you will definitely feel the free fall @ CAPS2 the hydrants of the water are nothing like a waterfall. What happens on this drop is the canyon narrows and when all that water goes over a ledge @ CAPS4 creates a hole at the bottom. @ CAPS4 is also lying at the bottom so there is tons of boiling water upstream so you get stuck in that hole @ CAPS1 like trying to paddle up the hill and there is hardly any way to paddle out of this hole. you just have to hope for the best, hold your breath, and stay calm. We were near the @ CAPS5 falls and there are only @ NUM3 whirlpools you can catch before the falls so you can spot @ CAPS4. Pretty funny when I was trying to do the second @ PERSON1 my boat got overturned by @ PERSON3's boat and that little bump ended up knocking me over and spinning me back, at this point I couldn't do big thing for the next few minutes of my life. So I dove over the falls, got entangled in a huge mess of whitewater for about a minute and a half, having only brief moments where I could possibly take a breath of fresh air. I resisted @ CAPS4 and didn't pull my spray skirt out because I didn't want to drink in the shoe (don't ask) and because if I ended up throwing myself off my boat it didn't there is no way to know what would happen to me in this monster. I fed @ CAPS4 which was only a short minute felt like a lifetime. I ended up being evacuated downstream and driving perfectly unscathed. when i rode i had the biggest smile on my face and my heart was racing. I don't think I would have done @ CAPS4 if I hadn't had a great attitude heading into this day and needed a laugh in my head when I messed up. Overall, laughing saved my life!

 I've always tried to be a happy person, and over time I've learned that laughter is a key part of my happiness. I have managed to be a happy girl most of my life. Even as a baby, I hardly ever cried; I was still laughing and laughing. Growing up, I tried to keep my mind happy. Sometimes it wasn't, but it just is. There have been many times in my life where laughter is all around me. I rely on laughter to stay close to my friends, and so far that trust has always been there, and it has worked for me. I often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness are the very essence of life. When I was born, I didn't cry. I never cried much when I was a baby. My mom reminds me of this every time I ask her about my baby years. When I was little, I wanted to be part of everything around me! I was always looking for laughs and exciting events; I didn't want to miss anything! My mom had to drive just so I could take a nap, and even then I hardly ever fell asleep. Because if I did, @ CAPS1 forbidden, I would risk missing a moment of laughter! If anyone else was laughing, I would laugh with them. Sometimes I had no idea what was going on, or wondered why what they said was so funny, but I loved the feeling of laughing with other people. I always remember my happy toddler years every time I look at my baby photos. I don't have one of those photos where I scream my eyes like you might find in most baby to child photos. In every baby photo of me, I laugh. If I'm not laughing, it's because there is a broad smile that extends from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby! As a preteen, I was always the girl you always saw laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it was like to cry because I had never felt this kind of feeling before. I was always laughing so hard that I never had time to think about the negative. Now I unfortunately know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I'm incredibly trying to go back to the time when I didn't know those feelings. Whenever I feel down, I try to find laughter in everything I do. When I try this I can still find the laughter and my spirits are uplifted. My friends are always a place where I can go and get myself. Especially @ PERSON1, who is my best friend. Whenever I'm with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @ PERSON1 and I haven't had the most stable friendship, but what always brings us together is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually she finds it, and she makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept @ LOCATION1 and myself so close for the past few years. If laughter weren't there, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now! It wasn't that long ago that I was in the car with three of my closest friends: @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS2 and @ PERSON2. We were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favorite songs. I looked at my friends and saw all of their smiley faces, and found myself smiling too. I then realized that laughter was really the reason for life. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was drawn to those I had the most fun with and laugh with the most. As you get older, that same thought is still there; I want to be with the people who make me laugh. The older I get, the more I learn what I need from a friend. My main criterion is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm around someone with a dry sense of humor, and who doesn't talk at all, then I'm going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious! Laughter is something I am extremely grateful for. This has been the key to making me happy for the fifteen years of my life! Since I was a baby, until now, laughter has always been and always will be, what my life is!

 One time where laughter made everything better was when I was with my cousin @ CAPS1, at @ LOCATION1. He will be attending @ CAPS2 soon, so spending time together was the main focus. @ CAPS1 and I have a close bond, we talk as much as possible over the phone. This trip meant a lot to @ CAPS1 and I don't know how long it will take before we see each other again. Every laugh and every smile was something we will always remember. My parents and I went to @ LOCATION1 for @ CAPS4. At @ LOCATION1 I met my cousins because my parents seemed to be busy all the time. Of course when there is a group of teenagers, well it's going to be loud. I remember - the @ @ LOCATION1- DATE1 to my cousins and I got lost in the city where we stayed. Now let me say that in this city no one can get lost, it is so small. So when we got lost we found it so funny and amazing that we got lost. Fortunately, it was during @ DATE1, it wasn't too scary. My cousins and I say that it was not our fault, we blame the taxi driver did not listen to our instructions. Because it was such a mess, we didn't stop laughing until we got to our destination. In the car, the three of us argued about where to go and which turn to take, while the taxi driver listened to us and laughed at us. It was so embarrassing that neither of us wanted to see this taxi driver again. @ CAPS1 is older and much taller than me, he was the tallest person in town. Now @ CAPS1 always says he's not afraid of anything and is so brave. Until one night this was all forgotten while @ CAPS1 was passing @ TIME1. I shared a room with my two cousins and CAPS1 @ stayed in the room next to ours with my brother. It was about @ TIME1, when we all went to bed. From nowhere we hear a strange noise outside our room. Next thing I hear is @ CAPS1 yelling in the other room, wanting to come and sleep with us. I was also afraid when my cousins and I decided to let him in. I turned on the light as @ CAPS1 and my brother entered the room. My brother @ PERSON3 came in with all the blankets and pillows, while @ CAPS1 came in with the air mattress. It was such a funny show that we all started to laugh. @ CAPS1 said "I @ MONTH1 am tall and tall but I get scared easily", that made us laugh even more. The noise turned out to be that of two cats fighting on the street. I remember that moment so well in my head as it concluded all of our family vacations. While my parents and grandparents were on the lawn with all the guests. My cousins, @ PERSON3 and I were in my room - as always the fun times were in my room - we were bored and didn't know what to do. Slowly, I began to fall asleep on a suitcase. All of a sudden my cousin @ PERSON1 has this crazy idea of how I can fit in a suitcase. I thought she was kidding, but when I looked up to see everyone's faces, I knew they were serious. So there, I open a suitcase, I take everything out while @ CAPS1 goes to look for his camera. Next thing I know is that I fit in the suitcase. I'm not an acrobat, and I'm not really flexible, so when I notice that I have no trouble fitting into the suitcase, I panic. My brother is almost peed in his pants laughing force so strong, my cousins are just baffled by what they witnessed. When it came to closing the suitcase I told them it was too far but they convinced me to zip up so they could roll me over. @ CAPS1, @ PERSON1 my brother and my third cousin @ PERSON2 all took turns riding me. They kept saying how we should get out on the lawn and surprise my parents. I got out of the suitcase - I was so dizzy - after my brother dropped the suitcase on the cement floor. We laughed and joked about how small I was and how fun it was after I felt a little better. Since then, @ CAPS1 has called me "@ CAPS13". Saying goodbye to everyone was hard, but saying goodbye to my cousin @ CAPS1 was even harder. Knowing that I won't see him for a long time is unbearable. @ CAPS1 and I have a strong bond, and I see him as a brother. During our entire trip neither of us could talk about his departure, instead we chose to have fun and ignore the pain. Laughter made that pain go away. It made our trip interesting.

 My best friend @ PERSON2 turned thirteen on a beautiful day @ DATE1. Her family had a boat and since it wasn't too hot but not so cold it was cold outside, @ PERSON2 decided to have a birthday sleepover on the deck with some of her closest friends. I was nervous about meeting his school friends since I had always been a home student and wasn't going to know any of the other people there. When I got to the boat, @ PERSON2 introduced me to his friends @ PERSON1, @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON4. I greeted them all and @ PERSON2 suggested we go @ CAPS2. I was ready to walk to the beach but @ PERSON4 said she wanted to go to @ CAPS2 right on the docks. @ CAPS2 next to the boats was not allowed and I was sure @ PERSON2 would say @ CAPS1 immediately but instead she walked over to the '@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2' sign, demolished it and threw in the harbor. His friends laughed and I laughed too. I had never seen people do this. But their disregard for rules and customs was contagious. As the day progressed, I watched how they spoke and behaved. The girls used foul language and spoke harshly. Everything they said was loud and shocking and all they did was be wild and challenge authority. They were acting so freely, but there was something about their interactions with each other that felt forced. I wondered if they were really like that or if they were just faking it. But I understood that to be part of them, I had to act like them. It was my first experience with peer pressure and I wasn't sure what to do. But the girls' attitudes were simple, so I adapted and started behaving like them. But it became clear to me that in order for there to be a band, there has to be someone who was not in the band. It was @ PERSON3. @ PERSON2's parents had made him invite @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON1 knew this. They sat close to each other so that she didn't have quite the room, they looked at her disinterestedly without laughing when she tried to make a joke. I realized that if I hadn't adapted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could always turn on me if I did something wrong. We were sitting on the deck of the boat talking about movies and @ PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about a movie she had just seen that was now her favorite. @ PERSON1 stared at her, refusing to smile. @ PERSONN4 has looked into space. @ PERSON2 looked up at me. Suddenly @ PERSON1 cut off @ PERSON3 and started talking about a horror movie she had just seen. @ PERSON3's eyes widened, then she looked at the floor. Without thinking, I laughed and reached for his arm, telling him that I wanted to know more about the movie. I'll never forget how she turned on that simple cuteness. She smiled and started to gush about how amazing it was with renewed enthusiasm. @ PERSON1 continued his story by looking at @ PERSON3 and me. @ TIME1, when we went to the movies and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I settled in with @ PERSON3 in the next row. We talked about the absurdity of drinking straws and how we would never, ever wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to him. I didn't have to remember everything I said to make sure no one liked me. Even @ TIME1 when we got back to the boat, I tried to behave the same way. I had never had to focus on myself before, but I knew that if I could, @ PERSON3 would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone has become more natural. Soon we all joked about the ridiculous things @ PERSON2 should be wishing with their birthday wish. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmallows. @ PERSON4 suggested the original @ CAPS3 from @ CAPS4. @ PERSON3 suggested that we wish everyone in America now spoke with an @ CAPS5 accent on @ PERSON2's birthday. Everyone laughed. That day I saw this kindness which is so powerful as it is cruel. Making someone an enemy or a stranger doesn't strengthen a friendship. You also don't have to worry about saying or doing something that might cause your friends to reject you. But integrity and kindness can bring people together.

                            Closer @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 In life, I think laughter is a very important part. Without it, not everything would seem so fun. Laughter can be a good thing, or it can sometimes be a little hurtful. Fortunately, my story is a laughing one. So, I'm going to tell a story from one of my laughing adventures. It all started one day when me and my cousin @ ORGANIZATION1 were at home. It was pretty much a normal day. Mom was in town and Dad was at work. @ ORGANIZATION1 and I were having a great day because it was a @ DATE1. Which meant that school only went until eleven o'clock. With mom in town, we said to ourselves that she wouldn't be back until much later. It gave us a lot of time to get it all done. The first thing we usually do when mom is gone is go get our music and go up @ CAPS3 loudly. Since there were only the two of us at the house, we didn't care how loud it was. This particular @ DATE1 surprised us, however. Because it was strange enough to look like a " natural " day . We felt very positive with a lot of energy. We were pretty much ready for anything. With the music so loud as we cleaned the kitchen, we could barely understand each other. Then @ CAPS5 for a while when the music stopped it was just a silent rush cleaning in the kitchen. @ ORGANIZATION1 and I tend to think the same way a lot. It's so weird. Sometimes I feel like she's just my sister instead of my cousin. Anyway, out of nowhere, and in complete silence, we started singing. I don't think we realized we were singing the exact same song, exactly the same time. Once we realized we were doing the exact same thing, it kind of freaked us out ! We were like ... "@ CAPS4, how can two people look so alike ?!" @ CAPS5 this happened, we continued to finish our work. '@ CAPS6 on this day, all the time, we do a lot of the same things. We are very @ CAPS2, kind of like sisters. I will miss her so much when she leaves!

 Laughter ... What is laughter? Laughter is what makes the world go round. This is what makes friendships and relationships tick. Laughter can lead to romance at marriage. Without laughing, people would be sad and depressed. They would bump their feet while walking. People would be stressed all the time. There would be a lot more wars. The world would not survive without laughing. That's what I know about laughter.

Laughter, an important part of life, the simple act of laughing is heartwarming because at that point everything is fine. Laughter brings people together and makes them laugh together, it's like a means of communication. Once you laugh at something other people start to laugh and it connects everyone to be happy. It's like telling everyone to be happy but not even talking to them. That's when people laugh with you, but when they laugh at you, well that's another story. I was frustrated, even me. I hate to be angry and I hate when people get angry, so I said something, I can't remember what but then everyone started laughing, it put everyone in a good mood. I think of laughing like fire, a candle can light @ NUM1 candles. When you hear people laughing, the first thing that comes to your mind is "something must be funny". And you want to go see what it is so you can laugh too. this is very common for most people who like to laugh. Personally, I like to laugh because it's a good weird feeling.

 Laughter between two people is one of the ways to tell if you are really good friends. The laughter between you is what cheers you up if you are having a really bad day. This is the reason why you know you have a great bond in your relationship. Laughter is the bond between my two best friends and me. That's why we've been friends for so long. One of my best friends is @ PERSON1 and the other is @ PERSON3. I have been friends with them for @ NUM1 years now. We are all very close and we do everything together. We hang out together, we play football together, we live together and we laugh together. @ PERSON1 loves camping with his family at @ DATE1. For the past @ NUM2 years she has taken @ PERSON3 and me. @ CAPS2 last trip I had sent many SMS during the trip @ CAPS3 I was the only one to have a service at the campsite. @ PERSON1's mom had yelled at me for texting so many times, which made me a little angry. @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON3 agreed with @ PERSON1's mom and yelled at me. I yelled back @ CAPS3 I didn't like the way @ CAPS1 were all ganging up on me. I said "I know, I'm hanging up. Shut up!" @ CAPS1 were both really surprised that I said that and got intimidated. We all stopped talking and things were really awkward for a little while. Then our friend @ PERSON2 who was also traveling with us fell face down while trying to do a cartwheel. @ PERSON3, @ PERSON1 and I all tried not to laugh @ CAPS3, we were mad at each other but couldn't help it, it was just too funny. So we burst out laughing together and realized that we shouldn't be mad at each other. We knew there was no way a little fight like this would keep us from being friends. We all hugged and said "I'm sorry." @ CAPS2 is why laughter is such a good thing, @ CAPS3 there is nothing better than knowing that you have friends who are there for you and can still make you laugh even when you are mad at them. It can make your bond between you stronger and can really heal any damage that has broken a relationship. In my case, laughter has solved a lot of problems like @ CAPS2 and always will.

 Laughter is the key to all the friendships I have. If a person is really nice, but I can't seem to make them laugh, or vice versa, it's hard to find common ground between us. When I see and reflect on my friendships, it brings back all the good memories over the years and months that have been filled with happy laughter. The simple things in life that make me happy make me laugh. Whenever the differences become clear in friendships, it only takes one evoked memory that made us laugh to reignite that friendship. Whenever I'm with my best friend, @ PERSON1, things that wouldn't normally be funny are. Another element implemented is that @ PERSON1 and I don't go out as often as we used to when we went to the same school @ DATE1 @ DATE1. Thus, the absence of each other makes us cherish our moments together even more than usual. Three nights ago I went for dinner with @ PERSON1 and her mom at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. We had many laughter sessions throughout dinner. Everyone around us either thinks we're very boring because we can't stop laughing or understands what it's like to have a best friend who makes your @ DATE2 brighter and thinks that we are. funny. There has never been a real fight between @ PERSON1 and me due to how close we got closer to @ DATE1 and realized how much like twins we are. Conflicts are therefore never really mentioned. However, one of my other very close friends, @ PERSON2, who attended my previous school with @ PERSON1, had problems with @ PERSON1. The most important thing for me is that they get along because they are two of the most important people in my life. I would do anything to make them friends like before, even though I probably don't have the power to. I can get closer to their hearts and stay on a level of laughter, secrets and wonderful memories. But when they don't get along, it's not that easy to bring them together. I had been with @ PERSON2 @ TIME1, so I knew how she felt as well as @ PERSON1, who I was with now. I tried to briefly touch on it and at first she rejected it. I knew @ PERSON2 meant a lot to her, and also that they had only had a little argument about something stupid. The problem was, both can be very stubborn, and in any type of argument, neither will first say they're sorry. It's because they both think they haven't done anything wrong. In this case, it was a little misunderstanding. I ended up going into more detail with @ PERSON1 about how @ PERSON2 felt, as I could totally relate. Later she started to see the other side of things, once I made her laugh. The key to my friendships is laughter. Especially when we are young. There is no way I could have made @ PERSON1 listen to my take on @ PERSON2's feelings unless they matched what she wanted to hear. So I told her what she wanted to hear. Things that made her laugh and laugh. Things that reminded us of the good times she, @ PERSON2 and I had spent. She thought about it, and even though she wasn't quite ready to run up to @ PERSON2 and hug her over and over and make peace, she was ready to consider communicating with him again. @ PERSON2. It was enough to make me feel good. The rest of @ TIME2, we put the drama aside and relaxed and enjoyed @ TIME2. We played our favorite songs and fell in love with @ TIME2 over the smallest things or mistakes we made in our speech when we talked to each other. I know as I get older I will remember my two best friends, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1, and realize how much they made my high school years so amazing. They made me a better person, someone who can enjoy life to the fullest by being in the right crowd and having innocent fun. They taught me that you can be good friends with more than one person, and even if these two don't get along, you can find a balance and end up excluding no one. Ultimately, the important thing is that you were a good friend to everyone, and you weren't selfish in the mix. Laughter brought me to this place. I find that when I laugh at really great things and don't make fun of someone or something, I become a lot less selfish and a best friend to people, because my intention is beautiful. I wouldn't have this prospect without the real friends @ CAPS3 has given me. At @ DATE2, @ PERSON2 calls me and tells me that @ PERSON1 called her and asked her to speak. Things will change very soon.

 People close to you appreciate the moment you shared with them and remembering it makes you laugh at what happened in that moment. Laughter brings people together that you have known for a long time because you had a feeling for that person and for the moment. Laughing at and enjoying the past memories with that person can bring you closer to that person and it can be important for this relationship. In fact, it has happened to me before; laughter came to me when I saw a special video from my past. That was when one of my cousins favorite was two and I was three at a family party. My cousin was very chubby and had straight hair, but that day she was very sick with a fever. I was very different because I had curly hair and I was small. We both had dresses, but the dresses were different styles. Then everyone at the party was having fun and so were we. The video came as my cousin and I were jumping up and down grabbing our dress and putting on a show for everyone at the party. At that time, we were supposed to dance. It seemed like we were having a lot of fun that day. Afterwards, my younger brother approached the place where we were dancing to see each other dancing, but he was working with him on a cup of soda. Then one of the older ones gets up from his chair and pushes him around and drops his cup of soda which has splashed my cousin and me. Our whole dress was wet, dirty and sticky from the soda. We both stopped dancing and sat down on the floor and started to cry. My aunt and mom changed us for something else, but later when we saw my brother we were so angry that we didn't respond when he asked us something or he wanted to talk to us about it. Later we had fun again and spoke to him again. Finally, the video stopped. It is important that laughter brings people closer to someone because together they have a good time laughing. My cousin and I watched the video remembering our memories made us laugh at what happened to both of us. We shared the same feelings and the innocents that we were at that age. We noticed how much we had changed right now compared to all the fun times we had together. We realized it wasn't my brothers fault for splashing soda on us. The laughter of all the moments we shared helped my cousin and I be more united. Obviously at different times in life you react differently, but laughing then or later brings people together. Sometimes over time the feelings are different, but laughing is important because you are having a happy time with someone. I remember events from my past with my family and we get closer to each other and laugh for the happy times.

I would say that laughter is something that comes from the heart. But that's really what's inside and how you really feel for the person and, how they feel for you, @ CAPS1 this person makes you laugh, you know they really love you and that she cares about you. @ CAPS1 you make someone laugh and they make you laugh so you are with the one and only real person. Laughter comes from the heart and the soul. @ CAPS1 this person says something to you that makes you laugh so it's true between the two of you. Feelings, @ CAPS2, @ CAPS3 is a lot between two people. @ CAPS3 comes from the soul and deep inside your body. like my mom would say, @ CAPS3 helps cleanse the mind and body but what i really think is @ CAPS1 someone makes you laugh they see the real side of who you really are and what you can become. you laugh at all kinds of things like jokes, funny videos, funny stories and more. But the real thing is that at least someone is making you laugh. @ CAPS1 he says this is the important part of any relationship what he is trying to say or stress is that you have to laugh in your relationships and have fun. But my thought about @ CAPS3 is you clear your mind and you have to listen to things and then @ CAPS4 it's funny so you start @ CAPS3 on it. Here's what my mom used to say to everyone, is "@ CAPS4 you didn't laugh at all today so you don't have a clear head or body". There are times in people's lives where they laugh and laugh and have a hard time stopping it, I think @ CAPS3 is just a feeling people have. You @ MONTH1 tell funny jokes that make people laugh but sometimes they don't even make them at all. You could be with a bunch of friends and at a party and you're just up and then you start @ CAPS3 because one of them decided it's too quiet and we all needed a laugh. There are times when you can play a really fun game and you have to do fun things or even do crazy things, but it all comes down to one thing and one thing that you need to laugh at once and, a. moment. I mean, doesn't everyone have to laugh I tell myself almost every day @ CAPS4 I'm not laughing so I haven't cleaned my mind or my soul. But is it really about me no it's not. @ CAPS1 you say you need to laugh, people look at you like you're crazy but you really aren't. What you're really trying to say is, can you say something funny then people will understand what you mean. I've been told funny things over the past few years, but I'm a teenager, what do you think I'll remember all of them. I am like everyone else, I will forget them over the years very easily. I'm not very smart, but after thinking about it for a few minutes, I finally got the joke. I know I'm a @ CAPS5 but I have these days where I tell people what are you talking about and then they look at me and, they just say wow ! you are really @ CAPS5 and i also have jokes on @ CAPS5 about me and I really don't mind that the folks at @ CAPS1 tell me jokes on @ CAPS5. Because I'm not affected at all, I got used to it. @ CAPS1 Heard my first joke @ CAPS5, had to stop and think for a few minutes then after about an hour I realized they were trying to tell me it was me. Then I walked up to them and I was like "@ CAPS6, I finally got that joke and then I was like a really good joke. @ CAPS1 you are laughing for the first time, this is because someone special made you laugh or they tickled you. They might even tell you a very funny story about themselves or someone related to them. @ CAPS1 you are laughing it's like you were showing your feelings and, @ CAPS2 to that person, because @ CAPS4 you are laughing then is just like wow you really got lost on what they were trying to tell you. i will always tell myself @ CAPS4 i need laughing or something to call my friends or just look in the mirror every morning. because for some weird reason I think I'm really funny. Most people think @ CAPS4 you look at yourself and do grimaces in the mirror, you will keep laughing. The reason I laugh is because I see or hear something really funny or just wanna laugh so much. @ CAPS4 I have a good day or a good weekend I laugh a lot

    Laughter is one of the many ways to share a memory. This is also a key part of storytelling, it shows that listeners appreciate what you have to say. When you share a laugh or a smile with someone, it's almost like sharing a deep secret that no one else knows. Laughter is having something in common, no matter how much money you have or how old you are, a person always has the ability to laugh out loud. Jokes inside are laughter's best friend, the second they are made at the slightest mention of them, they always make everyone smile and laugh. As a person, I think it's my job to make people laugh. An example of this would be when I was seven and was spending the night with my friend @ PERSON1. We had just finished watching @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and were super hungry for lunch. Turns out @ PERSON1 @ PERSON2's big sister was the only one in the house, and she wasn't going to have anything to do with her "little sister", so we had to fend for ourselves. Being young we didn't want a boring old sandwich @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 and @ CAPS5, we wanted to make cupcakes @ NUM1 ! It might seem like a ridiculous goal for two seven-year-old girls, but we were surprisingly ambitious and tackled it without a hitch, or so we thought. It was actually a disaster, we had no idea what a blender was so we mixed everything with our hands which worked until I pulled out the flower. From now on I will never think of the flower in the same way again, every time I open the flower pot I only think of the @ PERSON1 mess that I had made that day. Let's just say it was a disaster, enough flowers to make @ NUM1 cupcakes is approximately the entire bag. As I was about to pour this huge amount of flower into the bowl, I slipped some vegetable oil that had spilled from the measuring cup, and the flower went everywhere! @ PERSON1 started to laugh as soon as the cloud of white powder filled the room. As for me, I was still in shock, not to mention what appeared to be enough dough to feed the whole world. Now that I'm a little older, I don't think I could have taken such a mess so lightly, given that I would most definitely be the one who cleans everything up. But as a little girl, laughing was all that mattered. @ PERSON1 couldn't help but laugh as she looked at my whole body covered in white. We started playing in the flower, picking it up and throwing it in the air like it was confetti. When all of a sudden @ PERSON2 came down the stairs, took a look in the kitchen and started screaming, "@ CAPS6 and clean that up! I was upstairs for an hour and you manage to do everything that mess? be home in twenty minutes and you better get that kitchen cleaned up "@ PERSON1 and I looked at each other and back into the kitchen. It was then that I realized how much work we had to do. All of a sudden I started laughing uncontrollably, I felt like I didn't have any worries in the world. It turns out that @ PERSON1 and I completely ignored @ PERSON2 and continued to play in the flower for those short twenty minutes. We were building a fort in the kitchen surrounded by what we called "snow". I heard the front door slam as @ PERSON1's mother entered the house. It looked like paper towels ripped straight from the dispenser. Because we didn't clean anything, we actually made the kitchen much worse, we made a split second decision to go downstairs to pretend we hadn't done anything wrong. That @ MONTH1 had been our biggest mistake, as soon as @ ORGANIZATION1's mom saw the kitchen we heard a scream: "@ PERSON1! What's this ??" . Slowly, we go up the stairs to the kitchen and @ PERSON1 begins to explain. I chose to remain silent because I had never had any trouble with anyone who was not my own mother before. When @ PERSON1 has finished telling her story, her mother tells us to come down. We're both about to cry, when suddenly @ PERSON1 starts laughing again. I couldn't think of anything that could be funny as she said, "you still have flowers in your hair." From this experience, I learned that sometimes laughing is the only thing that will make you feel better. Even though I've walked away since that cupcake fiasco, I know if I ever speak to @ PERSON1 again, we'll start laughing at the mere mention of this story.

 Laughter is a big part of life, in fact it's all I wanted to see my grandfather @ PERSON1 do before his last days. I remember when I was about five years old I loved to draw no matter what it was as long as I had fun. My grandfather would give me some helpful advice on shading, texture, and the whole image itself. One of my favorite things to see was the smile on his face after figuring out how to use his techniques. We always had a good time together, he himself was an artist who painted most of the pictures in his house, as well as a few in restaurants. I spent most of my childhood at @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION3, @ ORGANIZATION2, where my grandparents lived. I don't remember the last time I was bowling @ CAPS1, but I do remember my first time. It was with my grandparents, and there was so much for a kid like me to do. Another time around @ NUM1 years ago my grandpa went to heat his coffee in the microwave and instead of putting his coffee in it he found some potatoes. He instantly made hash browns and we had a good laugh. There are a lot of things I wish I could do with my grandparents, like going fishing or even camping. Still, there are a lot of things I did with them, my grandpa painted my wooden scout derby race car as well. Whenever I had a race or a competition with boats, cars or planes, he was the one who painted them. He came to every race to see how I was, and for some strange reason I got the @ NUM2 spot most of the time. My grandparents also had a collie dog named @ ORGANIZATION1, I named him when I was young. He and I grew up as pals together, and my grandpa @ ORGANIZATION1 and I always went for walks together. My grandfather's favorite thing to do with the dog was to train him. He is the most obedient dog I have ever seen, he would go to the postman and pick up the mail to bring back, he would open and close the doors if he had a rope, he would even put my grandma's slippers in bedroom. When I lived at @ LOCATION4, @ ORGANIZATION2, every day after school my grandparents would pick me up and I would go to their house and wait to be picked up by my mom until I had the age of being alone. Grandma would always help me with my math homework and cook dinner, then Grandpa would help me draw or activate my favorite show @ CAPS2. When I was young I would go home in the morning and Grandpa would have recorded my favorite show "@ CAPS3 the @ CAPS4". Every morning it was the routine, then breakfast. Later in my life, when I became more independent, I didn't go to them as often as I used to and that's something I can't take back. A few home videos that I watched recently reminded me of a great time with them, my grandpa was recording me chasing the dog around the kitchen table and I hit my toe. Apparently it was fun for my family, everyone who laughed hysterically. Another time when I was younger my grandpa owned a barbershop and cut his hair for years at @ LOCATION2, @ ORGANIZATION2, and once home I didn't know what was a "mule", but I knew it was a hairstyle. I begged and begged until he finally gave in and gave me a mullet haircut, was amazed at what it looked like and immediately hated him. The last @ CAPS5 I spent with my grandpa, I bought a lot of gifts for him and my family. Thanks to the @ DATE1 job I had in the eastern part of the state, I was able to get an electric blanket that covered her entire bed, a few movies, and her favorite "@ CAPS6" chocolates. I can honestly say it was the happiest I have seen him in a long time which also made me happy. When the day is over and you reflect on how everything has turned out, you will notice that the best of times is just a laugh.

                                   To laugh. Laughter is a key element to have in a relationship. I knew someone who had a great relationship because of the laughter. They didn't think they would always be together if they didn't have any laughs in their relationship. Laughter is the shortest distance between you because if you can't see that person, you can laugh with that person and have a great relationship with that other person. The laughter between these two people was laughing all the time and they got closer than ever, even though they didn't see each other all the time, every day I knew their relationship wouldn't be alive if they didn't have a laugh. , it means you are happy with that person. Laughing with someone you care about also means that you can trust that person and that you are yourself with that person and don't have to act like you normally would with someone. another you don't trust! I had a boyfriend who I could laugh with all day and that's what kept our relationship together. We laughed instead of talking because it says how we feel about each other, and we could just tell we were happy with each other just by laughing. Sitting on the couch staring into each other's eyes then we just started laughing because we thought about something we had said that made us laugh out loud and just laugh like crazy even without saying a word. Even though we were arguing, we still made fun of each other and the things that made us laugh that the other said. I would be really upset and sad and he would just know what to say to make me laugh, so I'm happy because I know he's for me and cares if I'm happy or sad. A real relationship is very hard to find with a guy who can make you laugh when you are really upset or angry by smiling or saying awkward things. Even though he was mad at me, he still tried to make me laugh or smile because that's the point of my relationship. If you can't smile or be happy with that person you "love" then you shouldn't be with that person because you know you won't be happy and you will always be depressed or just planning an old anger at that person. Laughter is key, and it's something that can bring your relationship closer in a number of ways. If you laugh with that person and can be yourself, that means if you break up afterwards, if it didn't work out, it's probably a good sign that you'll be good friends afterwards. I believe that laughter is something that brings two people together and it is also the shortest distance between two people. to each other and I'm sure we were weird or something, but we didn't even care so we laughed and laughed all day every day all night. I think if you are not even in a relationship and you are just good friends like me and my friend @ CAPS1 you can just laugh at whatever you think is funny and have a good time you you don't have to be in a relationship with someone to laugh with someone. Laughter is great for the floor.

 Laughter is important in all relationships, whatever they are. If you have a friendship where you never laugh and nothing is ever funny, what's the point? I have four friends who are important to me. @ PERSON2, @ PERSON3, @ ORGANIZATION2 and @ CAPS1. @ CAPS1's real name is @ PERSON1 but we all call her @ CAPS1 because of the way she acts. @ PERSON2 and I did almost everything together. We were inseparable, we went to school together, we even ate our meals while chatting. @ PERSON2 and I can make each other laugh, whatever the situation @ MONTH1. I remember when @ PERSON2 and I didn't get along as usual. One day around 9pm my phone rang, it was @ PERSON2 I wasn't sure if I should pick up or not or just pretend to be busy so we don't both have an argument. Well I decided to drop out because it was the friendly thing to do and I knew she would have been there for me. There was obviously a reason why she called me, right? As I was about to say hello I heard @ LOCATION1 cry. I panicked, @ PERSON2 wasn't the type to cry because of something small. I asked her what was wrong and told her to tell me everything even if we were arguing, I wanted to be there for her no matter what because she was always there for me. The @ TIME1 before it was @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1, our whole group or whatever you wanted to call it got together and everything had looked good except the usual pointless arguments that always ended with a laugh. We had no idea that for the past two weeks @ CAPS3 from @ PERSON2 had been a "house keeper", he had no plans to return home to his family. Listening to @ PERSON2 tell me the news and how hurt she was, my heart sank. While she was crying, I was crying. His @ CAPS3, told him the news @ DATE1 @ TIME1 after we left for @ ORGANIZATION1. He won't go home because he hasn't been happy there for a while and he wanted a divorce. I knew exactly how @ PERSON2 felt, my parents divorced when I was very young. Even though it didn't tear me apart like she did, it still affected me. Not having a real family with one home and two loving, married parents has never been easy for anyone. @ PERSON2 had no idea that his @ CAPS3 would later marry and start a family with a woman he had seen for over a year as he returned home to his family. She kept telling me that she had to take him home, that she couldn't do that. @ PERSON2 and her @ CAPS3 were very close, she was one hundred percent daddy's girl. I remember she told me she just wanted to disappear, it was all her fault. All I could do as a friend was listen to her and tell her that everything would be fine. @ PERSON2 started to calm down and understand that things are happening and that she cannot change @ CAPS3's mind. I invited @ PERSON2 for the @ TIME1 to just hang out and maybe get rid of his thoughts for a while. It couldn't be easy staying home with her @ CAPS3 gone knowing he wasn't coming back. So @ PERSON2 came over, we played guitar hero and every time I was wrong she would laugh. Hearing @ PERSON2 again made me feel better because I knew she understood that it wasn't her fault that she left @ CAPS3. Without the laughs in this room I'm not sure @ PERSON2 and I could have been good friends again. After all, laughing at me spoiling the guitar hero brought me and her back to being good friends again. So laughing is very important in a relationship because once the laughter is gone, the friendship or whatever you know collapses. Now @ PERSON2 and I talk for hours or endless texts about anything and everything and when we're not laughing we know how to ask ourselves what's wrong.

A few years ago my mom and sister @ PERSON1 were in a sub-store for dinner. As we stood in line for our sandwiches @ PERSON1 who was several inches taller than me at the time said she was taller than me so I stood up and said I was always bigger. Then she stood up on her tiptoes (making her taller than me) and said she was too tall than me and she pulled me over, so I stood up on tiptoe ( making me taller) and I stuck my pussy out to her. Funny thing is there was this cute dude standing behind @ LOCATION1 so it looked like I was shooting him ! He had that amused look on his face like he was looking at a cute little child. I quickly put my tongue back in my mouth and returned to my normal height. I then told my mom that @ PERSON1 was going to find a place to sit. Once we found a place to sit I told her about the guy behind her and we both laughed it was really funny and we always joke about it! :)

Laughter can create this kind of bond that is difficult to break. I can tell you how I made quick, true friends just by laughing about the same things. It's an amazing thing when people laugh. It doesn't always make sense or sound so funny at the moment, but it will help anyone I think to feel better under any circumstance. I can tell you how I made quick, true friends just by laughing at things. Or how laughter can mend an argument you and a loved one have had. Well, there you have it, my story of a very true and very close to home story that helps me open my mind and have one of the best, true friends I have ever had in my life. To tell this story, I have to go back in time to about nine o'clock. When I was a young girl, my sister, @ CAPS1, or as I always called her @ PERSON2, and I hated each other. We never got along, maybe because we shared a room with an older sister, but I remember she never wanted to play with me or hang out with me. My older sister @ PERSON1 had just gone to the collage, so my sister @ PERSON2 and I got to know each other a lot more. Of course, we were still arguing and we still didn't get along very well, but we were on our way to becoming the best friends we are today. Well one day my parents went shopping my sister @ PERSON2 and I stayed home to clean the house. Well in my family when cleaning the music is explosive no matter what genre it is. As always, my big sister had to "order" me, or at least that was what I felt like I had at the time, and as always I was a stubborn little sister who never liked to entertain. the big sister's orders. Well @ PERSON2 told me i have to clean bathrooms, and i hate cleaning bathrooms i mean who does it right ? So I tell her it wouldn't clean them ... well it doesn't go so well with the big sister who is in charge while mum and dad are away. So we start to fight, and oh what a fight it was. I mean strong as strong can be. Music couldn't even be heard above the screams and screams. Like most fighting in my house, my sister and I will feed on each other so much that we barged out of this room and into our own bedrooms. While the music was still explosive and could even be heard from all over the floor. As I, and I can only assume that my sister was doing the same, I was planning my revenge on my so "wise" sister, and then the music turned into a catchy classical song which is one of the most popular songs. most popular of my house. This song was "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3", because I loved this song so much that I opened the door to my room. I guess my sister is like me because she did the same. Well, I had started singing and dancing in my room to the music, and I guess my sister heard me because she was out of her room and into mine. Of course, I didn't notice her, so I continued to sing and dance. Well, as soon as she started laughing at me, I stopped and looked at her. @ CAPS1 just laughs, I had said something on the lines too, you couldn't do better than that. So she tried and it was my turn to laugh. We ended up laughing at each other while dancing and laughing all the way up the stairs where we kissed and said how sorry and stupid we were for fighting. Then after everything that had just happened, we look around us at the work that remains to be done. We then looked at each other, laughed, and ran to do our work before mom and dad got home. We finish just in time for, as soon as my mom and dad got home, we were just doing the last cleaning. @ TIME1 after my mom and dad went to bed my sister and I spent @ TIME1 watching movies and laughing out loud. There you have it, my story of how sisters, or more like best friends, can fix and start anything while laughing and having fun together. Now my sister lives at @ LOCATION1 so I don't see her much, but whenever I can chat or call her. We spend hours laughing no matter what we laugh at. That's what laughter does, it creates that bond, a deep connection. My sister and I @ MONTH1 have had our fights in the past ... and in the future, but we have laughs that always help us stay together no matter what in life.

 "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." I think laughter is really important in any party, in any type of relationship. When people laugh, @ CAPS2 gets to understand each other better, @ CAPS6 usually people think you are a cool person when you say something funny, @ CAPS6 laughs with them when @ CAPS2 says funny things. It's more fun with people who laugh with you or make you laugh. There have been many times in my life that many issues have been solved by just telling a joke, saying something funny, or even remembering funny memories from the past. I have a lot of @ CAPS4 that I love, but of course like any other friendship we had little arguments between us. I remember one time my @ CAPS4 @ CAPS6 I went to hang out at the mall. Two of my @ CAPS4 got into a huge conflict over something really weird, which later turned into an argument. Of course we always had small conflicts, but @ CAPS7 time I guess both girls were serious @ CAPS6 angry with each other ! My other friend @ PERSON1 @ CAPS6 I was looking at them @ CAPS6 didn't know what to do. @ CAPS6 my friend @ PERSON1 was a little afraid that @ CAPS2 might get hurt. I told them “@ CAPS1 guys! Don't be like that!” @ CAPS2 looked at me @ CAPS6 stopped. So we started to walk. @ CAPS6 I remembered something funny @ CAPS6 crazy that these two girls @ CAPS6 did to us, at a camp the week before @ CAPS7, @ CAPS6 after this camp, I remember how @ CAPS2 used to say how we were going to be "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 For @ CAPS5" for our whole life @ CAPS6 that @ CAPS2 wouldn't forget how much fun we had. I started laughing as I remembered what we did this camp, @ CAPS6 @ CAPS2 looked at me like I was weird or something. So I reminded them of all those fun things we did, @ CAPS6 @ CAPS2 looked at each other @ CAPS6 started laughing really hard ! Because their conflict had little to do with this camp, which @ CAPS2 had forgotten! After that @ CAPS2 started talking to each other @ CAPS6 forgot about this conflict @ CAPS2 was having. Sometimes I remind them of the conflict, but @ CAPS2 just laughs @ CAPS6 says "We were so stupid, to create this conflict!" @ CAPS6, we all laugh at them. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." @ CAPS7 is why I think laughter really matters in any friendship. @ CAPS6 I think @ CAPS7's problem was solved by just saying some funny memories for @ CAPS2 to laugh ! @ CAPS6 reminding someone of something @ CAPS2 had forgotten.

Laughter is a key importance in life, family and relationships. Help people go through tough times and times when you just need a friend. Laughing is a big part of my life, joking and having fun, when something happens I try to cover it with laughter. People @ MONTH1 say that laughing is too much in situations, but a lot of people go through tough times. @ CAPS1 there was no laughing in the world would be boring and I think people would really have no experience of laughing and making jokes. Making others laugh makes me feel like even @ CAPS1 is a lame joke. I think because it gives me a good impression of myself, a good thing that I can do. My family has always been the type to joke, mess around and laugh about everything. There were a lot of good memories with me and my family, jokes and so on. We appreciate every little question of laughter because it's something we each cherish and it's a bond we don't want to lose. A time in my life when the laughter was really great was in embarrassing situations with people. My sports team, we go down very quickly during games and we start blaming other people which is the most common thing people do when they start to stress out in a situation like this. Causing so many mistakes, my teammates and I don't pay each other and act like a team. Right after losing so many games you really start to lose hope for yourself and your team. Our coach always tries to comfort us by saying that we did well or that we could have tried harder. Some people take this seriously or people just don't care and take action, nothing ever happened and these people are starting to kick @ CAPS2 and only care about their good friend on the team. One morning before we even started, things were tense between people. The captain noticed that two of the team members were talking about her and she confronted them saying "@ CAPS1, you are going to talk about me behind my back, tell me." @ CAPS2 was in shock nobody knew what to say so I said "Well that's just embarrassing". The whole team just started laughing because it loosened @ CAPS2, although it didn't totally fix things it just made the situation a little better. Another time in my life where laughter was a key part was during car trips. Being sucked in the car with my family going somewhere and on the way home from where we came back is a lot of bonding time. You start to talk crazy, without meaning, without being like yourself. Then it brings out the fun of messing around and then saying something or doing something if it gets really funny and it's a moment you don't want to waste. An example that happened to me during this experience was going to @ LOCATION1 and making up a lot of internal jokes about things we saw or heard. times like these that I always want to cherish because those people in your life right now won't always be theirs. To create memories, do the essentials and laugh as a family. Laugh with your friends. I think in some of these situations it might help release the tension between people and sometimes make things a little less weird between people. Just be yourself and don't change that. Having so many of these types of moments and so much more is special to me, whether they're good or bad. they help me remember things more easily. Just having little moments like these is special and it reminds me how much I really cared about this person or realized that a moment was not totally wasted, because there is had thoughts of people laughing and that's something that comforts me.

                                              @ DATE2's @ CAPS1 The hot sun of @ DATE2, pools to cool off the kids, parents who get together with friends and family for picnics and potlucks, and late-night sleepovers. Then there is my @ DATE2 @ CAPS1. The sun entered the whole window illuminating the whole room, I woke up to see the bright sunlight. I ran to my brother @ PERSON2's bedroom to make sure he was up and ready to start the day with me. He clearly was; the early bird himself. We left her room and started to smell the sweet scent of chocolate chip cookies, we booked it in the hallway in the kitchen to talk to mom about what we were going to do that day. When we got there mum turned around to show us her gigantic belly, which was holding my future little brother, we asked her what we were doing that day. Disappointed with her answer, she had nothing planned. My brother and I were disgusted but we quickly got dressed and went to the back yard where we were throwing together, the ball gently touched my cute leather glove while on my brothers it slapped the face. My mom came out and yelled at @ PERSON2 to walk over to the sliding glass door, for a second I thought I was in trouble for throwing too hard at @ PERSON2 but luckily it wasn't the case. My mother then called me also to let me know that my cousin was coming. My first thought was that @ ORGANIZATION2 is coming ! Then I started to think, my cousin @ ORGANIZATION2 is weird ... she always makes up lies, tells non-funny jokes, plays @ PERSON1 @ CAPS2 cards and plays silly weird video games. I quickly ask my mom when she's coming so I can prepare myself, for whatever I'm going to have to put up with, my mom tells me fifteen minutes. I quickly walk past her to my room where my phone is and call my neighbors @ DATE1 and @ ORGANIZATION1 to see if I can get out. Their mom responds and says I can come there as soon as the girls' housework is done, horny I tell my mom I'll be at the neighbors for a little while and @ PERSON2 should hang out with @ ORGANIZATION2 during my absence. She tells me that everything is fine as long as I leave before @ ORGANIZATION2 arrives. I am waiting for the phone call telling me that I can go to their place. Noon is approaching and they still haven't called, @ ORGANIZATION2 will be here soon and I'm sick of the wait. I decide to go out front where I can rollerblade around the block, I tell @ PERSON2 I'm going outside and he is tagging alone with me. @ PERSON2 and I put on our inline skates and we get out of the garage my mom comes out just as we are about to leave and tells us @ ORGANIZATION1 has called and we can go now we rush off and quickly try to step up the stairs in the garage at home. Sliding as we try to push each other with the inline skates, I finally get inside and start unhooking the latches. Take them off and head to the door when suddenly I hear a knock as I reach out to the door, it's @ ORGANIZATION2. I rush to the door to greet my cousin as I quickly escape to the neighbors' house. I arrive at @ ORGANIZATION1 and we decide to go play outside and run with her new puppy. We play for a little while then decide we should go inside and have a snack that we make, then the doorbell rings. @ ORGANIZATION1 runs to the door with the puppy on his heels and lets people in, I turn around from the table to see who it is and see @ ORGANIZATION2 and @ PERSON2 standing inside the door. They came to play too, I let @ DATE1 know we should watch a movie. She walked over to the film cabinet and pulled out the brand new @ CAPS3 movie ! We all sit down and start watching the movie each with a bowl of popcorn. We almost looked at everything when the doorbell rang the puppy rushed to the door and @ DATE1 got up to answer it this time my mom walked in and told @ ORGANIZATION2, @ PERSON2 and me that it was time to go. The puppy was delighted to see my mom so she peed all over the linoleum floor. @ ORGANIZATION2 didn't notice the dog was peeing on the floor so she ran to the door to put on her shoes and went flying backwards in the dog pee everyone was even laughing @ ORGANIZATION2. We said our thanks and headed back to my house to have dinner and get @ ORGANIZATION2 ready to go. The best times are with the people you love, they can make you laugh and cry. : @ CAPS4.

 It was a cloudy @ DATE1, but there's nothing to be sad about with friends. This circle of friends had just spent the whole weekend together, and they were going home. I was part of this group as a young @ CAPS6 who had known this group for three years. Three years ago I was shy, but something changed that. The group was called @ ORGANIZATION2. This @ ORGANIZATION2 was intended for teenagers and even some collage students. However, there were very few of us. It was our last year as @ ORGANIZATION2 and then we would be kicked out of the church we were meeting in. Together we made this weekend the best and the last @ ORGANIZATION1. The boys were very comfortable with the girls, so much so that they were actually going to make a deal with us. The deal was that during the car ride, if we rubbed their backs, they rubbed our feet. At @ CAPS2 the girls thought it was a crazy idea, but over time this foot massage looked really good. Three pairs were made, with a boy and a @ CAPS6 in each. The boys were seated in the second to last row of the car and the girls in the back. I rubbed @ PERSON3's back, but it's okay. Of all the girls out there besides her sister, I know the best @ PERSON3, so I was perfect for the job. This moment was a very chuckling time for the girls, and a very relaxed time for the boys. While the boys fell asleep, the girls laughed hysterically. Since we had our feet right next to the boys to rub against each other, the easiest way to wake them up was to kick them. It just caused more laughter and more alert boys. After we had had enough of the foot and back massages, we had to find something new to laugh about to make time go faster. It was @ DATE1 before @ DATE1, so our manager @ ORGANIZATION2 gave each of us a bag of candy hearts. The little messages on these candy hearts could keep us entertained for about an hour and a half. We would pick one at random from the bag and hand it to someone. I ended up donating @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON1 candy hearts that said "@ CAPS1". They were very confused, but again it caused more laughter. @ PERSON3 accidentally gave one to @ PERSON1 who said "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3". Andrew has had hearts on multiple occasions that said "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6". Once it started to get boring, we found a new way to make candy hearts entertaining. We would read the @ CAPS2 heart, then give it to someone saying it was from someone else. Kyrene gave one to @ PERSON4 saying it was from @ PERSON2 who said, "@ CAPS7 @ NUM1 @ CAPS4". Anytime we had one that said "@ CAPS9" then we would give it to @ PERSON1 saying it was from @ LOCATION1. Earlier, she had told him, "I thought you were @ CAPS10 for a while," but a lot of people thought she said, "I thought you were @ CAPS9 for a while." @ CAPS11, we are trying to catch up to @ PERSON1 for @ PERSON2 by giving him "@ CAPS9" candy hearts. We ended this @ DATE1 with hugs, goodbyes and laughs of jokes inside. A few phone numbers were exchanged, and a few that should have been were not. The trip ended well and everyone felt a little closer. We could kiss this person @ CAPS11, or we could get that person's phone number. Something in us has changed so that we can be a little closer. In my experience, I would say laughter is just one part, because in order to laugh you have to love who you laugh with. If I didn't like the people I was in the car with, I wouldn't have laughed with them. They say, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I don't believe this to be true. I think love is the shortest distance and laughter is just love shown. The claim that laughter is the shortest distance assumes that laughter is the cause, but in truth, it is the effect. Love is the cause of laughter. If laughter was the cause of love, then this world would be doomed never to know it either. Without love there can be no laughter.

                               Sound @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 someone hears something funny, said person starts to laugh. @ CAPS2 the funny thing heard was someone else was laughing, the whole room starts to laugh. This has happened to me a few times, but the one time I remember the most is @ CAPS2 where I started making weird noises. I normally make the sound @ CAPS1 and tel @ CAPS2 I'm bored and want to start a conversation, but I've never laughed and made sounds like this before. This moment changed the way I laugh today. The date was @ DATE1, it was my birthday, so I decided to host my party at @ ORGANIZATION1. I invited my two best friends, @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON3, to join me. We love to laugh and have fun. So inviting them was obvious. Immediately we decided that our favorite water slide in the park was the large and slightly oversized @ ORGANIZATION2 '@ CAPS3. It was a big funnel with flashing red lights and @ CAPS15 inside. We went on and on. Adrenaline was pumping through our veins at the end of the ride and we had jumped off the middle tube and rushed towards the stairs where the queue was standing. We talked, argued, sang, shouted and most likely annoyed everyone else in line. Then @ CAPS2 we finally got to the top of the stairs, we got in awe of the lifeguard. But not because he was beautiful. He looked like a little leprechaun! We stifled a chuckle and got on the ride. @ PERSON4 asked her to turn the intermediate tube so that she could go down the path backwards. He then started talking, and we couldn't help but smirk. He started flirting with us saying in his manly voice, “ @ CAPS4 wants me to go down with @ CAPS4 ladies ? " @ CAPS2 he said @ PERSON3 was the first to break. Then me. Then @ PERSON4. We couldn't hold back anymore. He then chuckled awkwardly and pushed the middle tube down the slide. We were laughing so hard that we didn't even pay attention to the ride. Then it hit me. "This guy looks like @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 !!" I shouted at @ PERSON3. @ CAPS2 the trip ended, we thought for a second. Then without a doubt went again. Truth be told, it @ CAPS8 looks like @ PERSON1. We started laughing again the entire way, until I made a weirdly abnormal sound. I made a noise that sounded like a pig's tail had just been pulled off. It was almost a scream, but not a scream anymore. @ CAPS6 just happened ? @ CAPS8 I seriously just ... just ... @ CAPS9 ?! Note : A best friend will always be there for @ CAPS4, especially @ CAPS2 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS8 something embarrassing. It's their job to poke fun at his weirdness. So of course @ PERSON4 was the first to say, “ @ CAPS6, was that it ? " @ CAPS7 followed by @ PERSON3's expression of" @ CAPS8 @ CAPS4 just @ CAPS9? " It was @ CAPS2 that we started laughing and then I started making even more unusual noises. I started to scream, sniff and gasp. We were still laughing at my crazy skeleton @ CAPS2 we got off the inter tube. Later, after refueling @ ORGANIZATION2 '@ CAPS3, @ PERSON4 decided to go to the wave pool. Of course @ PERSON3 and I agreed. The area speaker system started yelling the song "@ CAPS11" from @ PERSON2. @ PERSON3 is my go-to-gal @ CAPS2 it's about bursting into song. She started singing and then we all joined in. "@ CAPS12 my @ CAPS13, we should totally create our own song." @ PERSON4 said. We started to think of different lyrics we could say in our song. At first we knew exactly @ CAPS6 to say to complete the chorus, then we decided the song needed more lyrics. It was harder to imagine. But, then we decided that we should do the song about food and how we eat it. We had so much fun. Eventually we made the whole song and people were watching us as we were shouting it out to the world. Then the terrible noise happened again. @ PERSON4 started to laugh, then @ PERSON3 and I joined in harmony, then abruptly interrupted my @ CAPS9. @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON3 continued to laugh at my @ CAPS1 sound. I joined them laughing to myself. That night we went to bed humming our new song, "@ CAPS14 @ CAPS15" out loud. Now every time we go out together we start to sing our song, and sometimes even dance! People always look at us weird, but then we start laughing, and I start making @ CAPS1 sound.

                                  Comment @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 only took one @ DATE3 to change the entire function of my @ CAPS1. Two things that made my @ CAPS1 more than I thought @ CAPS3 could be ; @ CAPS4 and a girl. I realized during a single @ DATE3 that there is more to @ CAPS1 than what we see or hear. Emotions you can't describe. Something you have to experience for yourself. Thinking back to three months of changing events from @ CAPS1, I laughed at how quickly my @ CAPS1 spun around and started heading in the right direction. Also how a girl can take me to church and how @ CAPS4 can maintain a strong relationship. We are part of a movement that will last forever. She and I walk together on the perfect path to eternity. Have you ever had someone in your @ CAPS1 who made you so happy that @ CAPS3 made you change your @ CAPS1 plan forever ? I have found things on this earth that explain my whole purpose on earth. The first time I saw this girl. @ CAPS3 was like an instant shock in my body. @ CAPS3 felt like I needed her, like something was whispering in my ear, "go get her." One day I was talking to my friend about this girl that I couldn't get out of my head. I told her how I was going to talk to her @ DATE4 and there was nothing going to stop me. @ CAPS6 said "I have a class with her." @ CAPS6 thought of her and me together ; like in a relationship. With intense thought, @ CAPS6 looked at me and said, "Actually, I think you'd be perfect together." @ CAPS7 that @ CAPS6 said I said "sweet". I spoke to him that day. She was better than I expected. I needed backup though. I asked another friend to come with me to talk to her and her friends. I saw her in the hall. So we started to walk. We got to them and my friend just kept walking. Thinking in my head, "what a great friend." @ CAPS3 was me alone with seven other girls. I try to look my best. What @ CAPS7 me is, I actually removed @ CAPS3. She actually thought I was attractive. @ CAPS3 was love at first sight ? I don't know you tell me. Get closer to @ DATE3. I have my license. Looking forward to what my @ DATE3 would look like. Everything looked really good. Until I found a job in an ice cream factory. Waking up at four o'clock from @ TIME1 was not the best way to start my @ DATE3. I always wanted to impress her and be with her all @ DATE3. I met a guy named @ PERSON1. @ CAPS6 asked me if I wanted to study the Bible with him. I knew @ PERSON2 went to the same church. So I wanted to do @ CAPS3. About two months on DATE2, they went to a church at @ LOCATION1. @ PERSON2 was baptized there. Then @ DATE2; after their return. I have been baptized. We both had @ CAPS4 with us. Love was settling between us. What better way to do than date? We started dating on @ DATE1. Wonderful moments that I will never forget. That look she gave me like a fire burning in her eyes with love. Go to the beach, drive, take nice walks, pick it up and never let go. Always with the love that burns in us. I went to her house. I lost track of time and noticed I was going to be late to get home. @ CAPS3 was a rainy night. Say goodbye to his parents and give him a big hug. I ran out, got in my truck, and drove off. I couldn't see well. A corner appears out of nowhere. I started to slide on the road. A tree was heading towards me. I hit the tree. During the flight. Time has slowed down considerably. I thought it was @ CAPS3. An image came to mind. @ CAPS3 was his face. I landed with a loud scream. I got out as quickly as possible. I walked out with cuts and bruises but it was @ CAPS3. I thank @ CAPS4 for surviving my crash. I'm so lucky I wasn't dead. the main ointment is. I think I was put on this earth to be with her and that's what I'm sticking to. @ CAPS3 moments like these make you realize how amazing @ CAPS1 is. Laugh at @ CAPS3 now. How laughter can change your @ CAPS1. I finally said I love you my daughter. We are together to this day.

 My cousin @ PERSON1 and her boyfriend, @ PERSON2, had been dating for three years and they had a special date planned for their birthday. They booked at the @ ORGANIZATION2 at @ LOCATION1 and then took a stroll on the beach. For @ PERSON1 it was a small step up from a regular date, but for @ PERSON2 it was the biggest day of his life. That late night of @ DATE2 was the day he would ask @ PERSON1 to be his wife ! @ PERSON2 went to @ PERSON1 at 5 p.m. sharp. In his hands he held a bouquet of roses which was given to the most beautiful girl in @ ORGANIZATION1. She was dressed in a white and pink dress with matching pink heels and her hair was all combed fancy. @ PERSON2 was speechless when he handed her the bouquet. Once the roses were placed in the water, he escorted her to his car, @ CAPS1 number one. @ PERSON2 could not start his car. In total embarrassment, @ PERSON2 asked @ PERSON1 to drive his car for dinner. She chuckled and assured him she didn't mind. When they arrived at @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION2, they were sad to find that their booking had been doubled and the other couple had arrived moments before them. Desperate, they set off in search of something else. Everything else in @ DATE1 @ TIME1 seemed to be full, so @ PERSON1 chose @ CAPS2, their favorite restaurant. After a good forty-five minutes of waiting to be seated, they were lucky enough to get a window seat. @ PERSON2 ordered a burger and fries as he is not a fan of seafood. On the contrary, @ PERSON1 loves seafood, so she had a bowl of @ CAPS2's famous clam chowder. At the end of dinner, @ PERSON2 apologized for using the bathroom before leaving, but as he stood up he spilled his @ ORGANIZATION3 and it spilled over to @ PERSON1's new dress, creating a messy brown and sticky. @ PERSON1 cleaned up as best she could, but it was hardly helping. So far everything has been bad, but the worst was yet to come. When they came to pay the bill, @ PERSON2 started to panic. He realized he had left his wallet in his car! @ PERSON2's face turned bright red as he watched his girlfriend pay the bill. Luckily we didn't go to @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION2! he was thinking. @ PERSON1 was ready to come home but @ PERSON2 was determined to ask her so he begged her to walk on the beach and watch the sun go down. She has accepted. With step @ CAPS6, @ PERSON2's heart started to beat faster, his throat was dry, his hands were sweating and his body was shaking. They sat on the hot sand and talked for ten minutes. Finally @ PERSON1 was really ready to go, so this was his last chance. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the solitary ring. As he knelt, the ring fell into the sand. It was getting dark, so after a minute or two of frantic searching, he gave up and started to cry. @ PERSON1 was so confused and thought he was crying because she wanted to leave but as soon as @ PERSON2 calmed down he told her story and how it was supposed to be the perfect match for the perfect girl but it turned out. turned out to be the worst @ TIME1 of his life. @ PERSON1 just laughed, which made @ PERSON2 think she was laughing at him, but he continued anyway. "@ PERSON1, would you like to be my wife ?" @ CAPS4 tears of joy, she said: "@ CAPS5! As long as @ CAPS6 the day can be an adventure like tonight." @ CAPS6 times they mention this story they burst out laughing even though it wasn't funny at the time. Since then, they have had many hilarious and embarrassing stories that they can laugh at now.

It was another stuffy @ DATE1 @ TIME1, when @ LOCATION1 my best friend and I decided to go to our friend @ PERSON1. As soon as we have walked three miles to get to @ PERSON1, @ LOCATION1 realizes that he forgot his phone charger at my house. We didn't want to walk home and we didn't have a ride either because neither of us have our permits yet and @ PERSON1's parents are not at home. So @ PERSON1 and I start to think about how to get back home to get the cell phone charger from @ LOCATION1, when all of a sudden ... Cour; @ LOCATION1 and I'll check it out to see what the noise was. we open the shed and one of @ PERSON1's dirt bikes has fallen. @ PERSON1 and I take the motorbike out of the old shed infested with cobwebs. @ PERSON1 and I both have light bulbs above our heads and suddenly we are looking at each other with the same idea. not being that smart we think @ LOCATION1 can just mountain bike all the way to my house on main roads and he'll be fine. @ PERSON1 talks to @ PERSON1 about his idea and @ PERSON1 says it's a bad idea because his mom isn't home and he doesn't want us in trouble for a phone charger. @ PERSON1 repeatedly tells us to put the bikes back off road, but the next thing you know @ LOCATION1 is having the bike tested in the front around the neighbor's hood. I say to @ LOCATION1 "since there is only one mountain bike, you take it and you will follow it badly on the bike @ CAPS1 !" next thing you know me and @ PERSON1 are side by side on an all terrain motorcycle and @ CAPS1 bike on the busiest road in town and its black exterior. "@ PERSON1, you will end up there !" I scream. @ PERSON1 is taking off onto the road at about @ NUM1 mph and I'm about @ NUM1 yards behind him. Suddenly I see a white silhouette starting to come out of a driveway, I can't seem to figure out what it is ... When all of a sudden I see blinking red and blue lights ! I'm trying to warn @ LOCATION1 and yell "@ PERSON1 @ NUM3 !!!" yet it is too far away to hear me, but as it is dark outside the lights are shining on the whole street, @ LOCATION1 tries to lose it going down a side road but it is no match for a car loaded police. It's out of my hands now, so I ride my bike back to Jeremy's house and pick it up and we walk around the crime scene to see what happens. we keep our distance and act like we don't know him. the cop has @ PERSON1 handcuffed behind the cop car and the cop goes back to his car to write @ PERSON1 a ticket and I see @ LOCATION1 shadows under the lamppost throwing something in the bush .. Like it wasn't his dirt bike and he couldn't ride it, the cop calls a tow truck and makes him take the bike and the cop takes @ LOCATION1 home with @ MONEY1 in tickets .. As soon as they leave the place I will check to see what that @ LOCATION1 threw in the bush and it was a chew box because he's underage .. so I grab him. the next day @ LOCATION1 is home and his parents are at work so I bring him his gum, and he starts telling us what his mom punished him with when suddenly we heard the garage door start to to open ; her mom was coming home from work so I handed her her gum and ran into the garden and over the fence. he tells me not to tell it to a lot of people because he doesn't want everyone to know it but it is already the speech of the city ...

 It was a day like any other. I was going to the chess club to challenge the holder of the board. I had never met him piercingly since I was new to the club, but I knew if I didn't play @ CAPS7 at my best, I would lose. I walked into the room hoping to see the incumbent wasn't there, @ CAPS2 was. @ CAPS2 was wearing a blue baseball cap, a blue t-shirt, blue jeans and a pair of black shoes. Her hair was as dark as her shoes and it looked like @ CAPS2 hadn't brushed it in years, her skin was very pale. I was wondering how @ CAPS2 could get out in the sun without a way to block it. The board was set up and ready, @ CAPS1 was the clock. the clock had one hour on each side. I approached him, did not even @ CAPS2 seemed to me notice until I speak, "@ @ CAPS1 CAPS12 guna beat me quickly. I know I'm guna lose." @ CAPS2 is just sitting there looking at me like I insulted him. "@ CAPS1," @ CAPS2 scoffed, "it's your kid they think they can beat me." "I guess. I never really thought about it." I wasn't sure why it would matter, but I was playing it, @ CAPS1 I was absolutely sure it was or would be happening very soon. "@ CAPS4 please take the seat @ CAPS12 @ CAPS1 we can start the matches!" the coach shouted, "@ CAPS5, we all know the rules, black player @ MONTH1 starts white clocks @ CAPS4. Don't speak." "@ CAPS1." I said, "your name is what." "@ CAPS7's name is @ CAPS8." I hit the clock. Expecting it to be like lightning and move, I moved the part @ CAPS7. Bad move. @ CAPS2 called and pointed out that I had moved a part when it was not @ CAPS7's turn. Coach walked up to the clock and hit a few buttons, @ CAPS2 didn't even look like @ CAPS2 cared about the game and if a ten table holder could beat a one table holder. When @ CAPS2 set the clock, the clock displayed fifty to fifty-five. I was already on time and the game hadn't even really started. @ CAPS8 picked up the bishops of kings pawn and moved it one space. @ CAPS2 hit the clock like lightning. This was wired @ CAPS2 moved the weakest piece in the array. I had to stop and think for a long time or how I was feeling. I looked at the clock to see how I was on time. It was terrible to have been sitting there for about ten minutes and I hadn't even moved a single piece. @ CAPS1 I picked up the king's pawn @ CAPS7 and moved forward two spaces jumping @ CAPS2 wouldn't do anything that could hurt @ CAPS7 in the game @ CAPS13. I hit the clock @ CAPS7. We sat there for what must have been half an hour. @ CAPS1 I got up and went to the bathroom. When I came back I checked how the other @ CAPS4 were doing. Only one game was made, it was @ PERSON1 and a kid I didn't know. I asked who won, it was the kid I didn't know that strange, I had to get back to the game @ CAPS7. @ CAPS2 still hadn't moved, for a minute I thought @ CAPS2 was having trouble breathing. @ CAPS2 let out a yawn and moved his king's knight pawn two spaces and hit the clock. It was weird, @ CAPS2 just fooled around @ CAPS10. I didn't think for a minute, I picked up the queen @ CAPS7 and brought her to a square in front of her turn pawn. I said "@ CAPS9 @ CAPS10". with a strong voice. @ CAPS2 started to laugh, at first I was confused because I beat him. Then @ CAPS2 said “I'm doing @ CAPS13 with everyone I'm playing for the first time, @ CAPS13 opening.” @ CAPS2 started again laughing, @ CAPS13 when I joined him we were both laughing because I beat him. Then @ CAPS2 said: "@ CAPS12 is the first to see he could win in the top two." It surprised me, I thought @ CAPS2 was winning all the time when really @ CAPS2 had given people games and they didn't know it. We started laughing again, the coach came over and saw I won @ CAPS2 said good job and walked away. @ CAPS8 said: "@ CAPS13 is the start of a new beginning, I can quit boarding now because there is someone who can beat me." @ CAPS2 approached the coach and must have told him that @ CAPS2 wanted me on board one so far I'm on board one and @ CAPS7 new friend, @ CAPS8 is there with me on board two.

 "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." Many people say that laughter is the key to life. If you can't laugh, then you're not a fun person to be around. Many other people believe that laughter is a very important part of the relationships they have. In my opinion, I think laughter is also very important. It lightens the mood in awkward situations, and laughter also makes you and others happy. And personally, I would rather be surrounded by someone who is happy than someone who is not. A few days ago my mom, sister and I decided to go bowling at @ LOCATION1. The three of us have been invited to go, along with about @ NUM1 other women from @ ORGANIZATION1 we attend. We attend @ ORGANIZATION1. We had all made reservations at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 at @ NUM2 @ CAPS3. We got there first and sat there and waited about @ NUM3 minutes. Then finally, we saw some of our friends come in. We ran over there to greet them and show them where we were sitting. Our friends started to take their bowling shoes off the counter and then they ventured over to us. After all of our friends arrived we started to play bowling. We had a total of three @ CAPS2 for everyone. My mother, sister and I were all three on the same path, and with us there were two other friends. The first game we played a normal game. As usual, everyone received strikes except me. I was getting pretty discouraged. So our second game and we all decided to change the rules a bit. This round we couldn't bowling like we normally do. Each time it's our turn, we've found a new way and a new position to get the ball out onto the lane. After a while everyone ran out of things to try, so people started to lie down and sit on bowling balls and then throw a different ball down the lane. It was really hard. Towards the end of the second game everyone was tired. Their arms hurt and so did their fingers. My last frame, I stood up and chose the ball I wanted to use. I waited for the people from @ CAPS2 next to me to finish their turn and then I went to the bowling alley. I braced myself and brought my arm back before tossing the ball down the aisle. Just as I did, my fingers let go of the ball and I dropped it. The whole side of the bowling alley where I was laughed. I was so embarrassed. My face was beet red. It was horrible. Then on my next turn, I brought the ball back and then moved it forward and literally threw it down the other hall. I fell to the ground laughing heartily. It was so funny. That night was by far the best night I have had in a long time.

The @ CAPS1 We @ CAPS2 in @ CAPS3 Laugh is a usual @ CAPS1 used in different ways, to release tension, to enjoy a funny joke, or maybe just to express a laughing mood. I find laughter to be the key to having a close relationship with people. Maybe that's because every person who laughs is personal and every time someone laughs they don't think about how they look or what they should say next to fill the awkward silence, their guard is completely down. for a moment. Growing up with my dad proved this fact to me by having our relationship based on laughing about our issues or struggles with each other. Although I have @ CAPS2 a good relationship with my @ CAPS4, the relationship with my @ CAPS7 has always been quiet and cautious as we @ CAPS2 have failed to bring humor to the relationship. Which proves to me that laughter and humor are two very important things in creating a bond between two people. Since I was a young girl my dad and I @ CAPS2 have always been very close and I @ CAPS2 started to realize that every time I tell an adult or anyone really about him they will know him . Everyone seems to always know my @ CAPS4. Maybe it's because of his humor, or maybe because older women find him attractive, or maybe because he's nice, he's been popular his entire life anyway. Also, since I've known my @ CAPS4, he's never been a very serious guy, he'll make some kind of humorous comment or joke no matter what. It doesn't matter if I'm sad or enraged under the spell of my teenage years and my hormones, my mood will completely change and because of that she has shown me the power of laughter. The relationship between my @ CAPS7 and I, however, has always been difficult, for several reasons I'm sure, but one of them I believe is that we've never been able to laugh together. or have fun. See, it's from @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION2 and in @ LOCATION3 things are done a little bit differently. Laughing or being silly, for example, is considered disrespectful or immature, everyone should act correctly and children should respect their elders. So when my @ CAPS4 married her, I introduced her to sarcasm and jokes. I never had the reaction I was looking for, and since there was never that connection through laughter and humor, I felt watched around her. I @ CAPS2 never felt like I could express myself around her. I constantly feel judged and uncomfortable and it has allowed me to see the effects of not laughing. The laughter of a human being is emotional and personal, like crying, it immediately makes you feel happy, much like a drug. Once you make someone laugh you allow them to open up to you in a small way, and not only do they open up to you, but with the good reaction you received you start to create a connection with him. If there is no laughter in a relationship with two people, it tends to get awkward and no one can feel comfortable opening up to each other. Since being my daughter @ CAPS9, I tend to make jokes the same way he does. When there is tension, when someone is upset and I want to fix it immediately, I make them laugh. Someone once said that "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people", how I interpret this quote is that laughter is the one @ CAPS1 that everyone loves to do, it can either build or maintain relationships. This is the one @ CAPS1 that we always go @ CAPS2 in @ CAPS3. So come on guys have a laugh.

   It was not a fun day. We've all just heard some really bad news. Neither of us even came close to smiling. None of us. Even the people you see always smile, they had the most serious look on their faces. it was just a bad day. But one of our friends @ PERSON1 had the brilliant idea to go online and find something to cheer us up. It was truly an amazing idea. We spent hours on the computer sitting there looking for ridiculous videos we knew. Trying to make himself laugh. That's when our day started to get a little better. But it ebbed a bit when a few people left to go home. Only three of us were still at @ LOCATION1. @ PERSON2, @ PERSON1 and I were all sitting there watching @ LOCATION2 when a show we all loved started. Psych. It was also a new episode! what a beautiful day it turned out to be. The show is full of really puny and silly humor, but it suits all three of us. @ PERSON1 the most. We were all laughing and having a great time. @ PERSON1 was laughing after the show ended. So we asked what was so funny. He couldn't stop laughing. For five minutes, he laughs. when it finally stopped, we asked again. What was so funny. then he told us. “I was laughing my own laughter. I sound really weird.” That's when we all started laughing. how could he laugh at his own laughter. we quickly realized how difficult it was to stop. it turned out to be a good day after everything that happened. Now every time we have a bad day. we have just mentioned that day when we laughed at ourselves for ten minuets. And the day is better.

 Recently, during @ DATE2 of @ DATE1, I was fortunate enough to meet my uncle whom I never consciously met. This has been an important part of my family's learning for me because I met not only my uncle, but my legitimate actress aunt whom I have known since I can remember, and my dad at a local restaurant @ CAPS1 called @ ORGANIZATION2. These three were all siblings, and it allowed me to see what the siblings will joke about, talk about, and create a sense of nostalgia for each other. I have a stepsister of my own, but the degree of nonsense presented before me was on a far greater scale than I could ever imagine. Everyone was constantly in a state of laughter at the stories of the shenanigans my dad and brother and @ CAPS2 managed to get into. At one point, I started having trouble breathing. The stories and all the bad jokes spread made me realize that in my family there was a long line of parents who inherited a gene that forces us to tell bad jokes. Not even inappropriate jokes, but downright stupid. I realized my kids would tell bad jokes. We had dinner there for a few hours before my dad had to leave for his house at @ LOCATION3, and I needed to be brought home to my family here at @ LOCATION4. But tomorrow was scheduled for a day of exploring @ ORGANIZATION3 and lots of silly jokes to share. I woke up the next day, got dressed and prepared to laugh, I knew I was going to fall because of it. When I met my uncle and aunt as well as my uncle's girlfriend, we headed to the fish hatchery on what I believe is @ LOCATION1. All the jokes started off slow because everyone was tired and still awake for the rest of the day. We got to the hatchery and started by feeding a few fish that they have in a pond. We watched the fish swim in their concrete canals for at least twenty minutes. We then progressed through the hatchery and quickly got back to the car and made our trip to @ ORGANIZATION1. Once we parked outside @ ORGANIZATION1 we could hear the beautiful sound of rushing, so beautiful I really needed to pee. We walked along the trails and eventually climbed a marked path to get a close-up view of @ ORGANIZATION1 and were enthralled. I was tortured at the thought of using the toilet. I was able to hold it but it cut our visit to @ ORGANIZATION1 short which was a inconvenience for everyone but they had to. I will remember @ ORGANIZATION1 for its sheer natural beauty. After visiting @ ORGANIZATION1, we were heading to the very touristy town of @ CAPS2's @ ORGANIZATION3. We walked past it and I almost lost my mind when I saw the alpacas. Before doing anything at @ CAPS2, I first found a restroom and later we all agreed that we had to eat something. A theme restaurant @ CAPS4 was an obvious choice and we decided to satisfy our hunger at this beautiful establishment. They made us sit down and our host was a very nice young lady. we scanned the menu for something that looked appetizing. I had found that this restaurant had won the award for the tastiest burgers. Falling into temptation, I had to order one of these burgers. I don't regret doing this as it was one of the best burgers I have ever had the pleasure of eating. After satisfying the hunger that plagued us, our group started browsing the gift shops and the silly novelties they carried. From bookstores to art galleries to a shop that sold nuts and spices until we came across a shop @ CAPS5-cream. After walking all day @ CAPS5-cream was the best thing on our mind at the time. I had a very special flavor with berries in it. But I have yet to try a significantly better flavor. When we got our @ CAPS5 cream my uncle started sharing stories on @ LOCATION5 where he was from. Quite honestly wish I could have taken him back to @ LOCATION5, it felt like a big city with so many places to explore. Unfortunately I couldn't, but my goal now is to eventually visit him where he lives at @ LOCATION5. We finished our cream @ CAPS5 then headed to the car and drove to @ PERSON1 to eat at a really good restaurant @ CAPS9 @ NUM1o @ CAPS10's. We had dinner there and our stomachs were full of exquisite food, almost a whole day of very tasty and savory delicacies. It was my uncle's @ DATE1 day at @ LOCATION2. Now I wish he would visit me more often because of the good time we had on our little expedition through @ LOCATION2 with the plethora of bad jokes and stories that come with it.

   I was late as usual for the bus; barley having time to sit down before moving. I saw my friends sitting in seats behind one in another @ CAPS2 I pulled over and said, "@ CAPS1 guys are making @ CAPS2 hard to choose." " I sarcastically mouse. @ PERSON1 who was sitting behind @ CAPS3 motioned for me to sit with her. I gave @ PERSON1 a quick smile and told her that @ CAPS3 and I would turn around and talk with her. @ PERSON1 smiled as @ CAPS21 leaned his head against my seat. @ CAPS3 and I gave @ PERSON1 about five minutes of silence, and then we started talking with her. Around the time we got to college, we were all having a great time. So far @ CAPS3 and I were doing fine ! But as soon as the bus left the college, we burst out laughing! Everything @ CAPS21 said made me laugh and everything I said made him laugh too ! After we left college this little sixth grader came and sat down in front of us and was the boy boring ! He kept turning around, giving @ CAPS3 and I strange looks and wondering how many joints we had smoked. Of course, it cracked @ CAPS3 and I'm falling for it even more ! I was chatting about having stuff in my biology book. But I was talking about notes! The boy obviously thought I was talking about joints. Well, I for one will not smoke, try it, or let it come near me. @ CAPS2 I thought it was absolutely hilarious that he thinks I meant the joints. @ CAPS3 who was sitting to my left had her head in the seat crying because @ CAPS21 was laughing out loud @ CAPS2. Seeing this I laughed even louder @ CAPS2 as the sounds coming out of both of us were deadly silent laughter. The boy still turned around with stares and added eyebrows. As soon as we got past the fruit packing company he started taking us @ CAPS8. Now I'm trying to learn @ CAPS8, @ CAPS2 I had no idea what he was telling us. @ CAPS3 either. Of course, he didn't know what he was talking about either. He was leaning into the island talking to those native speakers @ CAPS8 who were also looking at us with big smiles on their faces. Being the comedian that I am, I decided to start talking about how he could find out more about @ CAPS8 and then about me when he was only sixth grade! He calmed down of course, but @ CAPS8's speakers were roaring with laughter. I mean I was shedding tears the moment @ CAPS3 got off the bus. After @ CAPS21 went down, I decided to register on the old @ PERSON1. @ CAPS21 looked like @ CAPS21 was trying to sleep, @ CAPS2 I gently pushed him and @ CAPS21 looked at me. I had personally forgotten @ PERSON1 in the back until @ CAPS3 got off at its stop. "@ CAPS16 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS17.k? Does @ CAPS1 need a doctor?" @ PERSON1 asked with a confused smile on his face. I tried to speak, but I was laughing between all my words, @ CAPS2 it came out like pea soup ! "@ CAPS17.k, now @ CAPS1 really scares me !" @ PERSON1 retorted with a serious face. "@ CAPS18 come on @ PERSON1 ! I'm supposed to scare @ CAPS1 ! I explained laughing in between. Still my @ CAPS19 looked like pea soup. " @ CAPS20, but @ CAPS1 still scares me personally. Don't do that! " @ CAPS21 burst out laughing. I had put my face on the seat, then lowered my head @ CAPS2 that all @ CAPS21 could see were my eyes. Then I did my eyebrow @ CAPS22 @ CAPS23 in which I move my eyebrows from one side of my forehead to the other, in a wave motion. Thought I was making her laugh! Which I was, but the explosion grew again more people watching us. I mean the attention was good. But the boy was always interrupting @ PERSON1 and I. He just blurted out "@ CAPS24 bueno? @ CAPS24 bueno? " @ PERSON1 and I would watch him again. He was of course absorbing all the attention. He then, I think, insulted my mom, which @ PERSON1 pointed out. Leave someone I didn't even know not, spoil everything. @ PERSON1 and I looked up to see her stop coming. It was really something to rethink everything we did on the bus together. The famous bus driver ride on the bus. disappear was a hilarious day @ CAPS2 was proof reading my bus ride @ CAPS19 paper. Good times. I told him that while @ CAPS21 down the bus. @ CAPS21 is started laughing and I was @ CAPS2 Finally, when the bus reached my stop, I crossed onto the road home and walked over. For fun, I decided to look back at the bus. I did and saw the boy me. watch. I lost it then.

 I met my best friend @ PERSON2 when we were in kindergarten. Back then, we were both shy and looking for comfort in each other. We had no idea that the acquaintances we made with each other would soon blossom into a wonderful friendship full of great memories and lots of laughs. The last @ DATE1, my family went to my grandparents at @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION3. My grandparents usually only used the house once a year on @ DATE2, so while they were home at @ LOCATION4 my parents decided to take advantage of the empty house. Both of my siblings are in their 20s and busy in college, so my parents invited @ PERSON2 to attend. We were so excited, as this was our first time going to @ LOCATION3 together. @ PERSON2 and I had lots of activities planned and couldn't wait to show him around @ ORGANIZATION1 (@ LOCATION1 @ PERSON1). The only downside to the trip was that we would be driving, we would be in the car for about @ NUM1 hours. I knew this since we often went to @ ORGANIZATION1 when I was little, so I brought a notebook we could draw and write in. By the time we got to @ ORGANIZATION1, this notebook had been filled from cover to cover with funny designs and sayings that @ PERSON2 and I had quoted each other for. @ PERSON2 and I have a funny sense of humor, we think everything is funny when we were together. It can be the most ridiculous thing and we will burst out laughing and no one will know why. Finally a good @ NUM1 hours later we got to @ LOCATION2 it was late though and we had to unpack so I wouldn't show @ PERSON2 until the next day. That did not mean that our night was not exciting, in the back yard of the house there is a pool house, and in order to keep someone at home when there is no one my grandparents rent the pool house. My parents knew that a man named @ CAPS1 lived in the pool house. None of us had met him, only heard stories from when my brother lived in the main house when he was attending college from @ ORGANIZATION1. That night my mom asked me to pick up my dad from the back yard because dinner was ready it was dark outside so I brought @ PERSON2 with me. When we got out we saw that my dad had introduced himself to @ CAPS1. @ CAPS1 looked exactly as I imagined him, he was wearing red shorts, no shoes and a peach colored t-shirt. He had sandy blond hair and was quite scruffy, he looked like a big beach tramp. @ CAPS1 quickly walked over to me and @ PERSON2 and introduced themselves. He was quite nice and very clumsy. Throughout our conversation, @ PERSON2 and I couldn't help but look unmoved. @ CAPS1 said he has to go, so he wanted to teach us a handshake he made up. He reached out and curled his index finger, ring finger, and middle finger so they were towards his palm and the only remaining fingers were his pinky and thumb. He motioned for us to do the same. We all did as he told us and put our hands in the center of where we were standing and he tapped his pinky finger and thumb against our little fingers and thumbs, he said goodnight and said ran to the pool house. It was very strange, but so funny that my dad, @ PERSON2 and I still do it on occasion. The next day I took @ PERSON2 downtown and showed him around. When we were on our way home we pulled into a craft store, neither I nor @ PERSON2 had ever been to. When we walked in it looked like any other average craft store, but upon exploring a little more we noticed that there was a huge section of armor and helmets the soldiers at @ CAPS3 wore. . As big morons we decided we had to put them on, so we put on the helmets and the armor and stood by the windows of the front store and waved at people. The ladies who worked in the craft store laughed at us and that also made us laugh at ourselves. We fell down laughing so hard, at this point the people who were working were no longer laughing, they were crazy that we fell wearing the armor. They came and told us to take it off and we had to go. We did what they told us to do. By the end of the trip we had made so many memories and couldn't wait to go back the next year. In my opinion, laughter is very important in relationships, it's healthy and it means that sometimes you don't need words to express how you are feeling. This @ DATE1 @ PERSON2 and I will be returning to @ LOCATION1 @ PERSON1 and we look forward to many new memories and laughs that we will share.

 At @ DATE1 of the month of @ DATE2, I had the opportunity to laugh on a large scale. If I remember correctly, the event started on the day of @ CAPS1 when my family gathered for a celebration. The day started off normally like any @ CAPS1, when everyone was busy trying to get ready for a feast, and I was lobbying, carefree and oblivious to the world around me. Still, I am able to work with my parents and complete the preparations for that day. It was a sudden burst of joy that finally let me in. A burst of laughter and joy came to me for no reason or reason, I just enjoyed it. The people, my family, looked at me with confused eyes, bewildered by my actions and expressions, kept their distance from me. Although I continued, I still felt a sense of worry, because if I had lost my mind, they too would lose confidence in my social prowess. That day, I noticed a different side of me, a side that I wished it had disappeared from my being. Never again will I look at myself in a mirror and for myself, I will not see the sane person I used to recognize. The day after the bizarre and nasty gesture I had made among my peers, I tried to apologize for my actions. Although the first attempt seemed to startle them, apparently due to the nature of my conversations and the apologies made during the short interviews. So I continued with my life, again oblivious to my surroundings, but it was different in my previous life. I felt a benevolent and gentle side of myself freeing itself, an incessant stress lifted from my shoulders and allowed me to continue in my daily life. It was then that I noticed that another person had buried itself in my soul, my alter ego revealing itself and possessing my body. This other being, this alter-ego, I gave the name of @ PERSON1, and with these new emotions that came with it I accomplished great feats. Even today it sometimes comes out at times when I have accomplished feats of knowledge or endurance. He gives me strength, promising me and all the peers around me to laugh. I see him as not another person so to speak, but another part of my being. Never before this day has this other side of me come out so clearly and with such promise. I believe we all have this person, this personality within us that empowers us to move forward and never look back.

                   Laughter is the Shortest Distance Between Two People One thing we have done since birth is to laugh. Laughter is something amazing in the world of human existence, it is something that relieves embarrassing situations, brings people together and makes life a little easier. Laughter is something that everyone shares. Some people find laughter in things different from others, but we can still laugh together. Many times in my life, laughter has helped me get through difficult situations, brought me closer to someone, and made my life more enjoyable. I remember a time when I was trying for a volleyball team. It was the first day of practice and I was really nervous because I didn't know anyone. I had never even heard of these people and now I was going to be competing against them. There was one thing I did know about them though. It was that we all shared a common goal: to be part of the team and be successful. The trials started and I felt like they were wondering why I was even there, but I ignored them and kept working hard. Practice went well for the rest of the week, but something was still wrong. I always felt like I didn't belong there. It was the last day of practice and the girls had warmed up a bit, but I still felt a bit uncomfortable. After the last practice, it was time to announce the teams. I was really nervous because what if I couldn't? Or if I did, but everyone hated me on the team ? He announced the names and I was starting to lose hope when he said my name. I was so excited, but the girls seemed annoyed that my name was called. When I got home I told my parents and they were thrilled for me. I then told them that I didn't really know anyone and that I kind of felt like a stranger. They asked me if I had tried talking to someone, and I said no, not really, they didn't try to talk to me so I thought why should I? My mother then told me that I could only get to know them if I spoke out. I thought about it and realized it really wasn't. I ignored them as much as they ignored me. I wasn't myself either, because I'm a really cool person and it's fun to be with me, for some reason I crawled in a shell this time. I decided the next day in training that I would go there. The next workout, I introduced myself and got paired with a girl named @ PERSON1. It was so awkward and at first we were just quiet passing the ball from side to side. Then I started talking to her and making jokes, she laughed and I laughed and we had a great time. The rest of the training went very well. The awkward moments faded into laughter. We all worked hard and joked with each other, laughed and I really felt like we bonded. Their laughter brought us closer together. All the while it was like we were so far away and so different and really it wasn't like that at all. Having fun and laughing together showed us how much we have in common and that we are all the same. I believe that day that laugh brought our team together. I will never forget this day. It was the day I learned how important laughter is in a relationship, getting to know someone, and how it brings people together. This volleyball season I have made a lot of new friends. I also learned a valuable lesson that an embarrassing situation can always be turned around with laughter. Today I still talk to these girls on the team and even today we all laugh together, just because you've known someone for a while doesn't mean the fun and the laughter have to fade. , because I think he should get stronger. Whenever I meet new people I always try to break the ice and lighten the mood with something fun, because I think that an important point in our lives is to be happy, to s 'have fun and laugh all together. This is exactly what I plan to do.

 Day after day people laugh. For many different reasons, only those who laugh @ MONTH1 know. There were times in everyone's life when they just needed a laugh. Maybe because we're upset, or to make a situation more comfortable, to get to know someone better, even just to strike up a conversation. I was @ NUM1, I finally got hired for a job. I am now employed for @ ORGANIZATION1. Being the youngest @ CAPS1 of the crew, I had to make a good impression. I didn't know @ CAPS11 to do. My first few days were awkward and silent. I was so nervous I kept telling myself “@ CAPS11 I do, I don't belong here. I don't know anyone, I don't know what I'm doing.” @ CAPS1 one of the days hottest of the year we had finished our day's work and everyone @ CAPS1 the crew were heading to the river. I hadn't planned on going to @ CAPS1, until @ CAPS2, one of the guys I'll be going to school with also came up to me and said "Hey @ CAPS3 @ CAPS21 need a ride to the river ? " and @ CAPS6 laughed. “@ CAPS4 could @ CAPS21 drive me over to my house to grab some shorts ? ” I replied. “@ CAPS5 I'm going to lend @ CAPS21 a pair.” @ CAPS6 said. “I don't think so. not that @ CAPS21 will have a pair that will fit my fat ass. " I replied. " @ CAPS7 @ CAPS7 @ CAPS17 I let go. " @ CAPS6 said @ CAPS2, and I walked over to his truck and went to his house. I noticed something as soon as I got into his truck, a bottle with @ CAPS11 in it that I thought was coffee in it . I asked him. "@ CAPS10 does @ CAPS21 need coffee in the morning ?" I said "@ CAPS11 talking about @ CAPS21 ?" @ CAPS6 replied "The bottle." I said " @ CAPS7 @ CAPS7 @ CAPS21 idiot, it's not coffee that chews saliva. " @ CAPS6 replied that I was left there. We got to his house, walked into the garage and there was the cutest dog I have ever seen, her name was @ ORGANIZATION3. She followed us. around the house and @ CAPS6 showed me around. Then handed me a pair of shorts and we went @ CAPS1 our way. We all got together at work and left from there. It was the first time as I was going to the river with them, saw so much of the property that I had never seen before. We drove past our hay barn and took a gravel road. to this gate that led to the river. Never seen the gate, I roll into the bed of @ CAPS2's truck, bouncing. The road has so many ruts. Once we reach the river, everyone starts to change. The girl of my boss is there and our team leader's girlfriend.And I take a look at them once over there dressed and my boss team, @ PERSON1, looks at me and says "@ CAPS16". and so I turn around and @ CAPS6 throws the cooler at me. I try and @ CAPS16 the cooler but it throws me in my butt. Everyone laughs, even me, @ CAPS6 comes to help me and says, "This is to look at my cousin and my girlfriend." . Everyone laughed, and that's how we started our day at the river. In a good mood. We sit and listen to music talking and having fun. Then, @ CAPS2 and @ PERSON1, start to float on the river. So we're all going, we're all trying to @ CAPS16 up. We finally make all of us sore from the rocks @ CAPS1 our backs. There is this log that I see, sitting in the river. I climb to the top and try a back flip. Only to show off of course. kinda how @ CAPS19 perfectly in the river. We're all starting to jump and have a good old time. It's getting dark, and we get to the bank, start to go inside. everyone is going a different way because we all know the best way back. And go up to the house @ CAPS6, once we reach the house they decide that we are going to eat out. Once we get to @ ORGANIZATION2 the whole order, @ PERSON1 tells me "@ CAPS20 o, @ CAPS21 know we were all a little worried about @ CAPS21, @ CAPS21 never spoke." "I had nothing to say "I replied. @ CAPS6 said "I know, but I can't help myself". I answered. I looked at his cousin and winked at him. "@ CAPS21 has balls, but I'm happy with @ CAPS21 @ CAPS1 the crew." @ CAPS6 said. It was then that I knew, I was finally welcomed. That night I stayed at @ CAPS2, and we sat down watching @ CAPS24 and joking around. Now after looking back I see that a good sense of humor can go a long way. creates a good relationship. Now for me @ CAPS2 is an older one for me.

 Laughter is how my friends and I connect most of the time, and that's how I became friends with a lot of them. You know when you're in a new class and you don't know anyone in there, so it's a little awkward because you feel like a loner. I try to make the best of a situation and make new friends, but I'm not always the best, so when I get the chance I make them laugh. First we take baby steps and the more we laugh together, it seems the closer we are to each other. At the end of the semester, you don't really like the class, but you don't want it to end because you've made such a good friend. The next semester, you find out that you have a class with this person but they don't like the class, so they move out. Then you realize that you break up a bit because you never see each other and if you never talk to each other it gets a bit awkward. The way we started our friendship was really by accident, but I didn't know a lot of people in the class and the people I knew weren't really my friends. We sat next to each other, and after such a long awkward silence between the two of us, she made a joke and I started to laugh. The next thing we know is a week away and we were talking and pretty soon we had some time together. Around halfway through the semester we were in trouble in class because we talked too much and we started to realize that we were starting to be best friends. The semester continued and we hung out more and more and she was the only one I hung out with sometimes. By the time the semester was almost over, we didn't know what our classes were, so we figured we would be separated. The day we got our schedules, we talked to each other and saw what our classes were. We saw that we were having a class together and we were excited. On the first day of the second semester, we went to the art class we had together and we laughed the whole time. At the end of the period, she told me that she didn't want to be in that class because she's not an artistic person. I went to my sixth period and was wondering if she was actually going to change like she said or not. At the end of the sixth period, I saw her and she told me that she had been disconnected and had gone to a class that she wanted. I still know people in this class but it's not the same because I knew we were going to lose our friendship because we would never see each other. It's been a few weeks since we are in the last semester and we hardly ever speak, sometimes it gets awkward just to be with her because it's not like before. Laughter is how I and she became friends and classes are what kept us apart.

The mood was mellow and the room was wormy with most of my family and friends. except for my brother and at the time I only had @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 ? Hell, I don't really remember, so I'm just going to guess the age. Regardless of the return to story, so I'm looking all over our story house @ NUM1 to try and find my brother, but for some reason this time it just seems impossible. And all I can hear in the background is my family laughing as this little @ NUM1 or @ NUM2 year-old runs full speed through the hallways and opens and closes the doors of rooms he doesn't have. has never been. And also shouting out loud "@ CAPS1 where you are, I haven't found you". And with one more door to open, it's at the start of the hallway where everyone is sitting or standing. This little boy comes running down the hall in a panic and can't find his brother. And open the door and take out @ PERSON1 his brother who wears the creepy monster mask and says "I'll have you tonight if you don't eat all your dinner". So know what I did as he told me to do. I ate my dinner so quickly that I ended up throwing up because he was so scared he would come after me that night! And the funny thing is, it happened on the @ DATE1 of my life, so that's the funny thing.

 @ CAPS1 Is it important to laugh ? In my opinion, laughter is very important! How could laughter affect someone's life? If there was or not? Also, is @ CAPS1 important to me to laugh ? Laughter is important for so many reasons. As a couple, in everyday life, and with those you have in your life. What would the world be like if there was no laughter in this world? It would be very dry and dull. It helps to connect people with each other, if they have the same sense of humor. Having a good sense of humor is very important these days. A lot of people use sarcasm that is not "laughter", but for some people it might be or some might feel hurt by it. However, most people who feel hurt by it don't have a sense of humor in any way. Most people have heard the saying " it takes more muscles to frown than to smile ", this is a very true and factual fact ! Having a glorious relationship is the best thing with my significant other. The affection that he can be in sharing our laughs together brings us closer to a point where we couldn't be at all if it weren't for laughter and communication. Having a sense of humor is an important thing in a relationship for most people. @ CAPS1 would you like to be with someone who bores you? Who @ CAPS2 doesn't make you laugh when you're sad? I certainly wouldn't want that. Laughter brings out great communication skills, laughing with someone shows your type of opinion on the topic you are talking about. In a relationship, could you imagine if there wasn't a laugh in it? Would you feel the same with the person you are with if it weren't for the laughter ? How would you feel knowing that the person you love isn't very “humorous” and that @ CAPS2 doesn't like to laugh often ? I couldn't handle it. I would like to love someone who is very funny with a great sense of humor. Laughter is important to me for so many reasons. I would rather be surrounded by very ecstatic people than someone who puts me down! I consider laughter to be one of the most important things in my life and in my relationship with my significant other. It brings us closer. People ask, " @ CAPS2, does it never get old to be happy all the time ?" " " Of course not! " I would say in defense. @ CAPS1 Would anyone think of it this way? Being in a phenomenal mood all the time would be the most amazing place I would like to be in my life and with my partner. In my opinion, I think almost everyone would feel close to what I say. However, people have their own opinions on laughter and how and @ CAPS1 it matters, there are titles for their opinion. I know a few people who don't like to be in a very happy mood, who would rather be sad all the time and don't care. Laughter might lift you up from that!

 When I think of a day when laughter was the element, I think of @ DATE1. It was one of the worst days of my life. I had planned to break up with my girlfriend. That morning my decision was final, and I was going to do it. For some reason when I woke up I felt sick. That day, everything collapsed. Towards @ NUM1 @ CAPS1, I went to my girlfriend's house and broke up with her. The next day I couldn't smile to save my life. All day long, my friends made me smile and showed me that they cared about me. The next day I felt so much better. I smiled and laughed like nothing had happened. All day long my friends were telling me jokes and being really stupid. They made me laugh so much. Over the next few weeks, I met another girl. I couldn't be positive about my life anymore. All I do now is just smile and laugh. I don't need to live my life in sadness. All I can do is be positive and smile. Laughter is very important. No one should go a day without it. Let's just let our lives live to the fullest and leave the past behind. Just think on the bright side and smile.

 My high school @ CAPS1 basketball team is not the best team, but the only thing we have, is the ability to make each other laugh . At the start of @ DATE1 the school held the try outs and the teams were decided. After graduating seniors and some players do not come out, or the team was brand new. Complete with all different ages of players. we were all civilians to each other at practices but we weren't all best friends who wanted to hang out outside of practice. The @ CAPS1 team decided to take a beach retreat and stay @ CAPS2 for a weekend. When we went from to the beach our phones were taken and we had assigned seats in the cars. This trip seemed like it was going to be long with my phone. We arrived at the house @ TIME1. As we all found a place to relax, shower or sleep myself and most of the team ended up in the living room conversing with the coaches. we are all sitting on the floor recalling stories about this @ TIME1's playing or funny stories from our past. By the time we finished telling stories he had reached @ TIME2 and everyone in the house was either tired or hungry. As we sat on the floor complaining of fatigue or hunger we all started to pay our attention to @ LOCATION1. @ PERSON1 was starting to fret about how hungry she was. In her opinion, she thought the house we were in should have already been fed with food for us when we arrived @ CAPS2, but @ CAPS2 had no food. As she continued on her rant she became more and more insane which made us laugh harder and harder. Finally, she reached her point of view . “@ CAPS2 ain't no steak or chicken in those freak- moms in the cupboards. » @ PERSON1 proclaimed. At this point the coaches and players started laughing uncontrollably. @ PERSON1 didn't understand why he was so funny, but we kept laughing and laughing at the fact that she just said that @ CAPS2 should be steak and chicken in the cupboards. The laughter continued for the next five to ten minutes. When we finally started to calm down @ PERSON2 came down the stairs. She had missed everything that had happened and we went to fill her @ LOCATION1 to stop us. “@ PERSON2 @ CAPS4 on the counter and look in the cupboard,” @ said PERSON1. @ PERSON2 hesitantly stood up on the counter and slowly began to open the cabinet. When she opened the wardrobe she looked inside and all she could see was chips. She turned and looked at @ LOCATION1. "@ CAPS3?" @ PERSON2 asked. As she turned to @ LOCATION1, @ PERSON1 just sat @ CAPS2 smiling. Then she finally answered the question. "@ CAPS4 me these chips right @ CAPS2!" » @ Said PERSON1. Everyone in the room started laughing as @ PERSON2 was so confused as to why she asked @ CAPS4 on a counter just if she could @ CAPS4 @ PERSON1 tokens, who was sitting next to the counter the whole @ TIME1 . The basketball team all started to laugh. @ PERSON2 got down the counter, but with no chips in hand. We all continued to laugh and kept talking @ CAPS3 had just happened for the next few minutes @ num1. As all the world has finally begun to settle in their beds for the @ @ TIME1 CAPS2 were still those moments of "@ CAPS5 when it was said" and "@ CAPS5 when she did this." That first @ TIME1 we spent at the beach did more for us, so we did. In going to the beach and making memories together, we were brought together by two common things. The love for basketball , and most importantly the ability to be able to come together as a team all because of the memories we shared as @ TIME1 in the kitchen. Today we still have @ CAPS4 on each other's nerves and sometimes we lose our temper with one another but, we'll always be laughing at the crazy things that happened on the trip, but the thing we laugh at the most is @ CAPS3 happened as @ TIME1 in the kitchen.

 It was a normal day at @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION1. That day, we were supposed to start our state writing tests. I wasn't necessarily worried about this due to the fact that I've always done well on condition tests and never failed condition tests. @ CAPS22 It was about a normal day for @ PERSON1. But I didn't know that @ CAPS18 was waiting for me in the computer lab ..... Thanks to the new @ ORGANIZATION1 state testing laws, we have to pass the write test on the computer. The only place in the school that had enough computers for the whole class was either the @ ORGANIZATION1 computer lab or the old computer lab (I'm not sure why we used the @ ORGANIZATION1 computer lab, but we did) 'Have done). @ CAPS22, I was already in a high mood because @ CAPS1's sense of humor normally lifts my spirits and puts me in a high mood. @ CAPS22, as we walked towards the computer lab, me and @ CAPS1 started making jokes on @ PERSON3 mainly because everyone else is doing it, @ CAPS22 we are just adding to the effect. @ CAPS19 we reached the computer lab, but the door was locked. @ CAPS22 while we waited for @ PERSON2 to lock their door and go down to the computer lab, me and @ CAPS1 made a few more jokes on @ PERSON3, but had no idea that real humor was waiting for me in the computer lab. When @ PERSON2 got to the door and unlocked it, I was the @ ORGANIZATION1 to come in and sit in the seat I wanted. @ PERSON4 was following next to me, and @ CAPS4 next to him. I remember a trick with the computer when you press @ CAPS5 @ CAPS19 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS19 @ CAPS7 and when it goes to a different screen you press @ CAPS8 and the computer will go to sleep. I tried it a few times while he was watching and he was still pushing my hand away. After a while, I decided the best way to get this trick out was to make him forget, @ CAPS19 was doing it when he least expected it. @ CAPS22 about @ NUM1 minutes later after planning my tour I tried it again. I caught him looking away to @ CAPS4. @ CAPS22 I pushed @ CAPS5 @ CAPS19 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS19 @ CAPS7. @ CAPS19 it went to a different screen and I pushed @ CAPS8. My plan had worked. @ CAPS19 @ PERSON4 turned right as soon as the computer went to sleep and panicked. He started to swear and hit me. I thought it was slightly funny @ CAPS22 I had a few laughs about it, but nothing could have prepared me for @ CAPS18 was about to happen. After @ PERSON4 woke up his computer and started his test, @ CAPS4 asked @ CAPS18 which I was laughing at. I told him: "@ CAPS15, you should have seen it. I put @ PERSON4's computer to sleep and he cracked on me." @ CAPS4 laughed and went back to his test. Two minutes passed and @ CAPS4 tapped my shoulder. I looked at it and asked, "@ CAPS18, kid ?" @ CAPS19 @ CAPS4 said, "@ CAPS21 this." @ CAPS22 I sat up straight and looked at him. @ CAPS19, he asked @ PERSON4, "Did @ CAPS18 make @ PERSON1 on your computer? This?" and he held down the power button and shut down the computer in the middle of testing @ PERSON4. I thought I was going to cry. It was @ CAPS22 funny to me and @ CAPS4 started laughing as hard as he could. @ PERSON2, of course, was not happy with that. @ CAPS22 she told me and @ CAPS4 to calm down. But it didn't matter. A little scolding couldn't compare to how funny it was. @ CAPS22 we ended up going back to our own tests. Hope I am doing some good about it. I really need the grade to be successful.

 Has @ CAPS3 ever been in this mood where @ CAPS3 just can't stop laughing, and no matter what, @ CAPS3 just can't stop ? That's the problem my good friend, @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 and I have it when we are together. Most of the time we just talk about random stuff and we both find it hilarious. Fortunately, for teachers, we only have two classes together. In these two classes, we sit next to each other. The teachers weren't too lucky. The other day in @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 we were allowed to move our seats and this to be our new place in the class. The girl who was sitting next to me moved around and sat next to @ PERSON1. Now @ ORGANIZATION1 doesn't like this girl very much, so I spoke up and said “@ PERSON1, @ CAPS3 can sit next to me !”. @ PERSON1 grabbed his things unusually fast and came over to sit next to me. Funny thing is when she sat down she said "@ CAPS3 saved my life". For some reason @ PERSON1 and I just started laughing all the time. We couldn't control it. To be honest, it wasn't that funny. Guess it was right in the way she said I saved her life. I'm glad @ PERSON1 is sitting next to me in @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. Without it, it would be so boring. In @ CAPS6, we sit next to each other and have a great time. Our @ CAPS6 course is at the end of the day, so we're ready to be home by then. @ PERSON1 and I are sitting next to each other and when we are taking notes, @ PERSON1 and I are exchanging notes. She and I talk about everything from the tough situations a teenage girl faces in high school, to boys and parents. I can tell him pretty much anything, and he's a good friend. Over the years @ PERSON1 and I have become closer and closer friends. Last year she and I had at least three or four classes together. So we've been to class together before. @ PERSON1 and I have become more familiar and open to things. I tell her everything and she tells me everything. One of the reasons I think we've become great friends is that she and I find the same things funny. We have the same interests in things. She's a good friend and I'm glad she's my friend. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I will definitely be okay with that.

 Hello, my name is @ CAPS1. I'm just a regular girl with a story like every other girl. I am writing this because this story means something to me and I would like to share @ CAPS2. Honestly, I count on a good laugh during my day. Without laughing, life would never be the same for me. Laughter brought me to who I am today. Not only has @ CAPS2 made me who I am, @ CAPS2 has made me meet all of my friends and the people I love. For example, I use laughter between me and my boyfriend @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 and I are like any other couple. We have fun, we do things together and we argue. The worst is when you fight. like everyone else, we have a hard time and we have a good time. Our hard times all start when we wake up. When I wake up, it's still very dark outside. The smell of fresh air @ TIME1 refreshes me. I still feel like the happiest girl in the world. Shortly after I wake up I text @ PERSON1 well at @ TIME1 and we are still talking during @ TIME1. Sometimes he comes to see me or I just see him at school. When I see him I'm happy and my toes are curved. We will go for a walk and talk about anything and everything, just about life. At this point, he thinks it's time to say something funny. So he does it, he doesn't care what I look like, what I wear and what I say. He doesn't find @ CAPS2 offensive but for me @ CAPS2 is. Many times I might even say something mean back that doesn't help @ CAPS2 only makes @ CAPS2 worse. Little time goes by, maybe a few seconds and we start to fight. He doesn't understand that he hurt me or he doesn't care. @ PERSON1 tells me he hasn't done anything wrong. So I try to explain @ CAPS2 and he doesn't listen. I just stop trying and if he realizes how badly he hurt me or what happened that bothered me that's fine but I'm not going to fight anymore so I stop to explain things. I've thought enough about it so I cry, and he gives me a stupid look. It only makes things worse, so of course our fight breaks out and gets even worse. There is screaming and screaming with tears and mean and rotten words being thrown all over the place, it's a mess. I used to storm @ CAPS2 because I can't take it anymore. Finally time flies and we haven't talked all day. We have nothing to say to each other. Eventually someone has the nerve to talk or say something to another. Always all of us on our nerves, so I say something silly or funny to lighten the mood. I will do anything to see a smile on her face, even though we got it wrong, I still love her and can't stand @ CAPS2 being like this anymore. Of course he smiles, just what I was looking for, it makes me happy and makes me laugh. @ PERSON1 will then ask for a hug and so he hugs me even if I don't answer or say no, @ CAPS2 doesn't matter to him. He apologizes and explains several things to me. I feel bad because I hate stress and fights so we work @ CAPS2. Now you can see if I didn't have to laugh I might be depressed. Without laughing, things would be more difficult and more complicated. But a good laugh or a simple joke can make things easier and much better in life. I just want people to understand what a little laughter can do for your day. If @ CAPS2 can change your day in such a big way that @ CAPS2 can change your life in a big way. Things @ MONTH1 seem hard or rough. When I look back on my life and see what @ CAPS2 has done to me and for me, I realize that I have laughed at something each of these days even though I was done and @ CAPS2 m 'brought back again.

It's true @ CAPS8 they say, time flies when you're having fun. By a particularly warm @ DATE1 @ TIME1, a rehearsal was underway for the wonderful production of "The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2" and I was bringing my best friend, @ PERSON2 some cheap but delicious food. We talked and ate for a while, but finally it was time for me to go. @ CAPS3, we went down the stairs to get to the back doors of the building. I asked if they needed help with the room. "@ CAPS3 we actually do !" @ CAPS7 said with enthusiasm. “We need a @ CAPS4 women's suit.” I had absolutely no idea what @ CAPS8 meant, but felt the position had potential. "@ CAPS5, I can do it. Just a question ..." I said a little confused. "@ CAPS6?" @ CAPS7 replied, slightly amused. "@ CAPS8 exactly am I going to @ CAPS12 do?" I asked him. We changed course and headed to the costume room so that @ CAPS7 could introduce me, @ PERSON1 who would be @ CAPS12 my boss for the next two weeks. We arrived to find that @ CAPS7 had already gone home for the night. A little exasperated, @ PERSON2 explained to me the basic idea of the job. "Basically @ CAPS9 @ CAPS8 is going to happen is you go to @ CAPS12 in charge of changing rooms and costume changes on stage." @ CAPS7 said quickly. "@ CAPS11 okay, I can do that." I responded with confidence. @ CAPS3 I started talking to him more about @ CAPS8. "@ CAPS12 here at @ NUM1 tomorrow morning and you will learn everything you need to know !" @ CAPS7 said hurriedly. @ CAPS3 @ CAPS7 rushed into the theater, I could hear the start of the play begin its lines. “During my younger and more vulnerable years my dad gave me some advice…” I left happier and more excited than I have been in months. The next morning I went to the theater which is in the school I attended before. It was strange to go back but at the same time quite normal. I was even more comforted knowing that I could see my friends every day. I could hug them and laugh with them, I could have social interactions! Something I missed because of online school. I walked into the theater and @ CAPS3 soon @ CAPS3 I was bombarded with excited people asking me why I was there while hugging me tight. “ I'm helping with the costumes ! " I said @ @ CAPS3 CAPS3 excited they were. I split up with the group of people and found @ PERSON2 who was on stage leading the scouts. We chatted for a while then @ CAPS7 took me to the costume room where @ PERSON1 was waiting for me. @ PERSON1, was an elegant woman. @ CAPS7 wore a light gray cardigan and colorful top with corduroy pants and suitable shoes. Immediately @ CAPS7 started telling me @ CAPS8 my duties were and @ CAPS8 I was going to @ CAPS12 to do that day. going on. " @ CAPS7 handed me a pen and a pad of paper." @ CAPS15 notes on the location of lighting issues and that sort of thing. " @ CAPS7 said. I walked out and wondered in the auditorium and took a seat in the second row of seats. The lights were lowered and the rehearsal began. “In my younger and more vulnerable years my dad gave me advice…” @ CAPS16 I knew the end of the day had come and I was in no rush to leave. The cast and crew were doing an amazing job with the play, but I knew I had my work cut out for me. In the end everything went really well, we had some great shows and shows @ CAPS1 but the most important part of this experience was the time I was able to spend with the people that I have. love. I will miss them so much when I'm sitting in my room all alone doing the schoolwork that consumes my happiness and laughter on the internet. on the other hand, I'm ready to help with the next two productions going on in my old school.

 In life @ CAPS13 share many of your moments laughing and enjoying the sweet, sweet sound of the chorus that @ CAPS13 and the people in your life are sharing. Laughter can instantly bring pleasure to @ CAPS13, no matter how unbearable the struggles of your @ MONTH1 life are. I have had many moments in my life that have become enjoyable because of the laughs and smiles. But one moment overtakes the others. This moment is @ CAPS1 before my grandfather passed away. This @ CAPS1 was the best of all. It was a white @ CAPS1 and for once the snow wasn't the only thing glistening. That day everyone in my family was smiling, we were all grateful that my grandfather had survived his sudden heart attack the week before and we all knew his time was near. We had to make his last @ CAPS1 a great time to end. My grandpa was the cutest old man he could always make @ CAPS13 smile no matter how sad @ CAPS13 was. He was a man who loved the laughter of his grandchildren and he made sure to make an impact in our lives. This @ CAPS1 was, however, where our laughter had the most impact. On @ DATE1, all of the family on my dad's side walked through the hills to their destination ; My house. The house was covered in @ CAPS1 decor and shone with the happiness that each of us had in him. My grandfather was the first to enter. I hugged her and told her "I love @ CAPS13 grandpa with all my heart! Happy @ CAPS1 !" @ CAPS8 he smiled and started tickling me like he always has since I was little. He grabbed my hands and started to spin me around, humming his favorite song. As we whirled to the tune of her favorite song, my laughter broke out. When this happened, I looked straight into my grandfather's eyes and saw the love he had. He has always said that "the laughter of a young child can always bring joy to anyone, even the most cruel of people." @ CAPS9 we were still shooting, all the other members of my family came into the house. They were smiling at us and laughing at us, but we didn't care. This was going to be a great @ CAPS1, nothing could spoil it for us. When everyone entered the house we all sat down in the living room sharing stories about all the good and old times we shared. We all knew this was what my grandfather needed, and in his eyes we could all see that he was happy to have a family, who could forget all the hardships we were going through and allow ourselves to be. sit as a family and enjoy each other. Everyone was laughing now, remembering the stories that made our family what it is. My aunt @ PERSON2 was the one who knew them all by heart, she could even play them. My grandfather sat there and laughed. He was filled with pleasure watching his only daughter do what she did best. When dinner was almost ready, my grandfather and I sat alone at the table. We started playing the game we've always played. I got under the table and hopped on random seats acting like a cat. My grandfather would always say "@ CAPS11 down @ PERSON1, this food is not for @ CAPS13." then I would sit next to him and meow next to him, and we would just laugh. No one else understood the bond that my grandfather and I had. But it didn't matter, every holiday we were the ones who always laughed; we enjoyed life and we never left anything to us @ CAPS11. He was the only one in my family who understood pleasure and he helped me live my life that way. Dinner was served and we all took our usual seats. My mom's food looked amazing as usual. My grandfather and I were sitting across from each other as we always would and we made the most unusual faces for each other. Our laughs filled the room and made this @ CAPS1 even better. As we all finished our dinner, my grandfather stood up and walked to the door, looking outside at the beautiful landscape covered with a white blanket. I walked over to him and looked at him. He smiled at me and said "@ CAPS13 never realizes the finer things in life, until your life fades away. The finest thing for me is your laughter. It always brings joy. in my heart. If only I could hear one more sound it would be your laugh @ PERSON1, and if I could only see one more thing it would be your smile. I am happy to be your grandfather and I am happy to have been able to live and see @ CAPS13 grow up to be such a beautiful and sweet girl. Always remember, enjoy every moment. Especially the moments with those @ CAPS13 adores. "

 A lot of people say that laughter is a big part of any relationship, and I agree that a lot of people don't always laugh and in every relationship, laughter is an important part in making someone the happiest day. he ever had. There is always someone having a bad time at school or at home or any other place and when you see someone like that you should always cheer them up by saying something nice or even saying something like i hope you have a good day @ DATE3 give them a smile so that can put a bad thing in it which is to keep them from laughing aside and you just made the day by sharing your smile and laugh with them. Many people need someone to turn to when going through a very difficult situation or problem that they cannot go through on their own at home or even at school and they need someone. who to talk to and share their feelings with a shoulder they can cry on and it always makes someone feel good leaving all of this pain and their inner self to others we all need to make someone smile and laugh who is going through a difficult time and it is always a very healthy thing in a relationship and it is a way of offering healing to that person who is in pain or who is sad. It reminds me of a true story that I know because I was there. Once there was a girl I had in my elementary school, she was a very happy girl, she shared her laughter and happiness with others. cutest girl in school, everyone loved her and she tended to always show love and respect to others, it always seemed like her life was so perfect that she didn't of worries, she was just full of joy and she was the only child in her family so of course her parents always gave her what she wanted or at least that's what we all thought. It had been a @ DATE1 and we had become @ DATE2 and we were all in school except this girl, she never missed a day of school so it was very strange for her not to be there, but like all the other people she must have been sick, that's what we thought, except she missed another day, then another, and another, so I was starting to think she had moved and that she would probably never come back but the next week she arrived I was very happy to see her I had missed this girl except there was something very different about her she was not the same she no longer laughed or smiled; she had lost that glow that made her so different. I was like "what's wrong with her?" i finally found out she was gone because her mom had passed i was so sad i didn't know what to say she was just so happy and overnight she didn't have her mom i thought Having both of my parents and she shouldn't be sharing the happiness she shared with me and others and being there for her now that she was going through the most difficult time of her life. This is why being happy and sharing your happiness with others is always the best thing you can do for someone because you never know what kind of things are going on and they need someone for them. make you smile and laugh.

 Building the @ CAPS1 with the @ CAPS2 laugh at a very young age, my uncle would bring the funniest cards to my siblings' birthdays, just to see our reaction. Then when my uncle moved to the west coast near us, we got on our nerves just to see each other's reaction. We've always known when the other is having a bad day and when to pick them up when they're down. When my family and I returned to @ CAPS3 at an early age, we always celebrated our birthdays with our uncle. He would bring the funniest cards to give us and we would just sit there and laugh about it for hours. Then when he moved to @ LOCATION1, my older brother, @ PERSON1, and I started giving him some fun cards to see who had the best. We got ourselves cards that ranged from sexual humor to crass humor. We would come to everyone's birthdays with a smile, @ CAPS2 ear to ear, waiting for the person to open the card. One year, for her birthday, I gave her a card with older women on it and some sexual humor. Let's just say no one has beaten this card. My uncle and I work in the same building but do very different jobs. He is the sales manager and I assemble the items for him to sell. When I go to work, I always walk by him to see how he's doing. For the most part, he laughs or gets angry about something in his day. On the days he's upset and goes out to label @ ORGANIZATION1, I start laughing at him right away. Sometimes he gets even angrier. But when he does, he always seems to laugh after the fact, or come back to me with a rude remark. It happens every day and it always seems to brighten our days. We purchased two season passes at @ CAPS4.Hood this year. At first I was not very good at skiing and I was always falling. When I fell he would cling to me laughing and I was very pissed off. We were laughing on the way home talking about how I would always fall. But over time I slowly got better than him and would be waiting for him at the bottom of the race. Once when we got on he couldn't seem to stay on his board and was falling nonstop. This was the moment when I could finally get him back for all the times he laughed at me for not being able to stay on my skis. I've never laughed so much in my life on this ride home. Getting down and remarking her about not being able to stay on her board was one of the warmest things I have ever felt. It was not comforting for me to make rude remarks. It warmed my heart to see that he couldn't say anything back, because his time had finally come to be laughed at. My uncle and I have the relationship we have today, because of its impact on me from a young age. The fact that he was able to make me laugh at his jokes and know when to brighten up my day was one of the best things that has happened to me to date. Change my life for the better and change my personality for the better. These experiences of laughter transformed our “uncle-nephew” relationship into a relationship of friendship. My life is full of laughs and will be full of laughs for my life because of one person.

 When I was in what I believe was sixth grade I went to @ ORGANIZATION1. This year, I felt like I was old enough to ride the "big kid" rides that I had never done before. I remember walking to the hotel entrance @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 with my mother, my older sister @ PERSON1, @ ORGANIZATION1 little sister @ CAPS3. We had to go because it was the fastest way to get into the park. There were giant stained-glass windows that led to the hotel lobby. The door was magnificent. They had an exterior seen on them there were bears, fish, trees, rivers @ ORGANIZATION1 mountains. We all entered the hotel. The ceilings must have been twenty feet high. We walk the whole way although hall @ ORGANIZATION1 follows the signs until we get to the park entrance. There was a man-made mountain in the middle shaped like a grizzly bear around which one of the rides was built. It was early in the morning so the heat in @ LOCATION1 had not yet fully set in. We started with the smaller @ ORGANIZATION1 side attractions like it's hard to be a bug @ NUM1 shopping the parades in the park @ ORGANIZATION1. My mom was dissuaded from coming back in time to see @ LOCATION2 on stage but we never got back in time. It was around noon @ ORGANIZATION1 the sun was hot. We were heading for the pier. the song @ ORGANIZATION3 from @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 was playing in the background. There were old sunscreen advertisements painted on the fence that surrounded this end of the park. across the pier was a man-made ocean that was so blue from all the dye it was amazing. It looked a bit like toilet water when you put the blue cleaner in it. The air smelled of frying @ ORGANIZATION1 popcorn, it made me @ LOCATION3. We kept walking until we got to the roller coaster @ ORGANIZATION2 '. There was a fifteen minute wait time for the trip, which wasn't long. my older sister @ ORGANIZATION1 i stood in line @ ORGANIZATION1 started to wait. I had never been on such a big roller coaster before so I didn't know what to expect. I had a butterfly in my stomach, I was getting nervous but I didn't want to back down. finally we came to the first row. the man standing there working the ride asked "how much?" my sister held up two fingers @ ORGANIZATION1 the man pointed to the floor next to him @ ORGANIZATION1 said "row eight". The next set of cars arrived at @ ORGANIZATION1, they got us into the eighth car in the row. I lowered the security bar. The journey has started. The roller coaster cars pulled around the corner @ ORGANIZATION1 have stopped. There were speakers on both sides of my head that I didn't notice until the sound started coming out. It was a man's voice @ ORGANIZATION1 background music. the voice counted ten @ ORGANIZATION1 the "take off" shouted @ ORGANIZATION1 the ride was at high speed. It was going so fast that my face was pushed back into a smile. The ride then slowly climbed to the top of a giant hill @ ORGANIZATION1 dropped to the bottom. There were so many twists and turns that @ ORGANIZATION1 turns the carousel even upside down ! when the time came to take the photo at the end i was crying i was laughing so hard. my sister @ ORGANIZATION1 I left the ride @ ORGANIZATION1 walked over to the booth where they were showing the photos they had taken of the people on the ride. Our two faces were priceless. We then made the trip five more times before heading back to the hotel for dinner. Since that day I was addicted to roller coasters, @ ORGANIZATION1 has ridden a lot since then.

It was @ DATE2 around @ NUM1 degrees west @ LOCATION1 me and a couple of friends were really bored and hot all we really had to do was stay home and play video games . So I ended up getting the idea to go out and maybe cycle to the store, grab some ice cream and water, and then go up to burger hill and possibly myself. sit in the shade. Everyone agreed to the plan, so all my friends left, we all had showers at our house and met me around the corner, then we rode our bikes to the store. We got all the items and as we walked up the hill the big kids that were in middle school came and jumped on us all and stole all of our food supplies. Now these guys always harassed us for some reason and to this day @ CAPS1 still never understood why maybe it was because we didn't like what they were doing or can. -being that they hate us because my friend @ PERSON3 stole one of the children's girlfriends but that's another story. So after they finished hammering our faces in the dirt they got on their bikes and drove off at sunset like they were proud of themselves for beating @ NUM2 years old our day was ruined , I had a black eye, @ PERSON3 threw up standing, @ PERSON2 walked limp and poor little @ PERSON1 had a little scratch on his tiny little head. After the brutal beatings the next day, I called a group reunion in our treehouse to be true, I was fed up with them constantly beating us by stealing our food and giving us ultra corners that we needed to take a stand against our oppressors for too long this was going on so I devised a plan a perfect plan to make sure they never hurt us again and the plan went like this, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 would talk to all the kids who were abused by them and get them to join our revolt, then we would get all the water balloon eggs and rotten food we could. One of the kids knew they always left their homes and got on their bikes at @ NUM3 pm so at @ NUM4 at night me and @ PERSON3 were digging out a few of their tires, every thing that came to my mind was just genius so after a day of planning and hard work and pleading with our parents for money the plan was finally made, and so we waited and just like the kid said they all went out to @ NUM3 once they noticed their tires had been punctured some of the kids jumped off the bushes and started throwing food at them then me and a few kids walked past them on our bikes and threw water balloons at them they all separated those whose bikes had not been cut they chased us they were going pretty fast and almost caught up with us when I gave the signal @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 pulled the rope and the big children flew from their bikes and face planted like in the movies and it really looked like the plan was going pretty well and it looked like we were winning the w ar but as usual some things are too good to be true it looks like we forgot the other big kids in the neighborhood and when they saw it all hell broke loose shortly after their reinforcements arrived they supercharged us like a lion on a gazelle beating all of us like we had stolen something but luckily I was smart and I told my parents and my friends the parents of the kids and earlier our parents came yelling at them and told them what was going on and like a god in the end they were grounded for the rest of them @ DATE1 and finally we all played in peace with no fear whatsoever.

      Have you ever laughed so hard that you peed? This @ MONTH1 or @ MONTH1 has not happened to me. In my story, I'm going to talk about the funniest moment I ever had with my best friend @ CAPS1. How it all started was that it was my best friend's birthday and she was going to spend the night with her grandmother. She only invited me to come with her so I couldn't say no. @ CAPS1's grandmother had an @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. She was old and was in a club @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. I don't know about you but it always seems to me that old people have to be in some kind of club. So anyway, in her club, what she was doing was going on a trip. @ CAPS1 and I thought it would be fun to go on a trip. So we wanted to tell everyone at @ ORGANIZATION1. @ CAPS1's grandmother let us into the store to buy drinks for this trip. I wanted @ CAPS4. The bottle was really cool. There was a top like a water bottle would have. I have the red type because it's the best. We have drinks and @ CAPS1's grandma said to go to the car while talking to the adults about the trip. So here's the fun part of the story. I got in the car first. I was pretty thirsty so I decided to unscrew the cap he opened to put the paper back on sale. I put the cap back on and had a drink. Meanwhile, @ CAPS1 got in the car and closed the door behind her because her grandmother was talking to adults. As she closed it, she caught her hair in the door. She was laughing and yelling at me to come help her. I was laughing too hard to come and help him. I had my glass between my legs and the stopper was open and I remember it is like a water bottle stopper. I laughed so hard I squeezed my legs together and my juice went straight to the front seat. He didn't come in and was just in his grandmother's seat. It was like a rocket, it was so funny. @ CAPS1 with his head still stuck in the door asked what was that advice on the seat. I told him it was my juice. Then the two laughed. I don't know why but @ CAPS1 just shot his head and his head was no longer stuck. It was as if ten pieces of her hair were stuck in the car door. She looked at the seat and said we had to talk to her grandmother about it. I didn't want her to be mad at me because her seats were white. I thought it would stain. But we ended up telling him. She told us to get towels from the bathroom. The whole time we went to the bathroom, me and @ CAPS1 were laughing so hard. We cleaned up the mess and I didn't have any problems. Guess I never peed my pants laughing but I almost did that day. After that day my best friend @ CAPS1 and I are still laughing about this story. I'm so glad we did a seniors club trip @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3.

 For a year and two months, I had dedicated my life to horses, school and @ CAPS1. We started as friends at the @ CAPS2 level, and it grew into a relationship at the @ LOCATION1 level. We ended up breaking up later that year, but we continued to be “ friends ”. Obviously I still cared about @ CAPS1, but I didn't think he felt the same. But apparently I was wrong, we started a new relationship on @ DATE1 at @ NUM1 pm. It was the perfect start to our "perfect relationship". He and I were inseparable from the start, we literally did everything together. I was @ PERCENT1 irrevocably in love with @ CAPS1. Between the two of us, we shared some crazy memories and jokes inside. I could probably write a bestselling novel of all the memories we had, and I honestly believed that @ CAPS1 and I were going to be together forever. I thought everything was fine, until he had to expose it, he loved someone else. At that time, I had no idea where our relationship (or me) was. I didn't want to know. I couldn't keep opening my heart if it needed to be stepped on, but I loved @ CAPS1 and would do anything to make it work. I spent the night with @ CAPS1, and we spoke up to @ NUM2. He and I decided to try and get it to work, but there was no guarantee it would. The next day everything seemed fine. I was still extremely irritated that he liked another girl, but I used all my power to make the most of what we had. We decided to take her dog @ CAPS3 for a walk. We were holding hands as we walked, but it was too quiet. Why? He was texting @ CAPS4. At that point, I decided it was the last straw. I felt like I was embarrassing so I felt the only choice I had left was to quit @ CAPS1. I walked through the door an hour later, absolutely devastated. I cried until I felt I couldn't cry anymore, and then I cried more. At the time, I really felt like the world was ending right before me. My life was over. My days became long and depressing, and I felt all I could do was give up. My heart broke every time I saw @ CAPS1, and it got even worse when people kept asking me what had happened. I couldn't tell them, it wasn't a moment that I would want to relive. I couldn't stop thinking about @ CAPS1 and all the memories we had shared. This year and these two months has been the greatest time of my life. Almost every time I thought about @ CAPS1 I would cry. I couldn't stand the thought of not having @ CAPS1, and thinking about @ CAPS1 all the time made me a walking zombie. I couldn't eat, couldn't drink, and was throwing up from stress. But as I sat alone thinking about the memories, a miracle happened: I laughed. I was shocked, but it made me realize that I had to go on living. I don't regret any of the time I spent with @ CAPS1, it has changed my life. He taught me so much about loving someone. I knew from that chuckle that things were going to get better. A ray of hope, I would be happy again.

 The word (laughs) @ MONTH1 means a smile or something nice that happened to someone or even a thank you, but for a lot of people it means the action or the sound of laughing. For many people, the feeling they get inside when they laugh is a feeling of happiness. The sense of feeling good on the inside is the sense that you should be happy in life; have a balance in your life. To me the word (laugh) means to be happy and to feel like I'm doing something right in life. For example, when a couple gets married, they need a laugh in their life to be able to enjoy their company. It was @ DATE1, @ NUM1, @ NUM2 early in the morning, I was extremely excited to be leaving because it was the day I was going to visit my grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, uncle and cousins I had not seen for about eight years. I remember that morning I felt both a feeling of happiness and sadness. I was about to leave for two and a half months, I was going to miss my family and friends, but at the same time, I felt happy and excited to be going. . That morning we arrived at the airport; I was about to board my very first plane. As I tried to find my place through the large line of people who also found their place; I sat down and strapped into the seat and looked out the window and around. My stomach was spinning in circles and I had the fall of a roller coaster about to take off very quickly. The next thing I knew the plane was moving, I got a little scared, but at the same time I was excited. During the flight, I felt a laughter in my soul; memories of a childhood at @ LOCATION2 turned my emotions into laughter and tears that made me feel good that I had never felt. The thought of seeing all my family and friends captured my heart and my emotions. As we arrived at the airport @ LOCATION1; my emotions were going in circles. We only had two flights left to reach our destinations. I was starting to get tired and sleepy, my legs and arms ached so much that they felt like taking care of two big bags of potatoes on either side of my leg and arms. We decided to go eat somewhere as we were walking around to see what we could find to eat, we found pizza huts. Next thing I knew was we only had an hour until the next flight, so we agreed to head to our next flight. When we got to the gate, people were already entering the hallway to get on the plane, so we hurried. Three hours after the purchase and we had landed at @ LOCATION3, @ LOCATION2 which was our destination. I felt a laugh inside me as we waited for our return home; the feeling I had was like someone had taken something from me and returned it to me. I started to cry then, but at the same time I was laughing. We arrived in the late afternoon at my grandparents' place, as I looked at them, I felt happy inside, they were happy too. we decided to spend the @ TIME1 at my grandparents' house, that @ TIME1 nobody fell asleep, everyone was too busy talking to each other and catching up. The next day everyone was tired and sleepy, but they were all happy and full of laughter inside. We had passed a mouth in half with family members that I hadn't seen in a while, we all felt happy and with a sense of laughter inside. Everyone had an amazing time reuniting with family and friends. We couldn't do everything we wanted, but the best part was the time I spent with my family and friends. The word laugh means to me the best thing that has happened to you and makes you feel good inside, or even the memories you think of when you are alone and sad, these are the memories that will make you laugh and feel good. in your skin. Other people @ MONTH1 say that laughter is the feeling you get when you laugh, but laughter is the best feeling in the world when you are happy. In this part of my life, laughter was a big part of my whole life and it is still a big part of my life. Over the generations, people have used the benefits of laughter in their lives, for example many famous and not famous people, important people and not. A lot of people say that when you are not happy you will die without knowing what happiness is. People really enjoy these moments that they spend with that special someone.

 There will always be times in your life when your emotions take control and motivate you. whether you are happy, sad, angry or frustrated. At times like this, I use my gift, the gift of laughter. My best friend, @ PERSON1 looked at me with her big blue eyes, they were swollen with tears. We had just finished packing the rest of her clothes and we knew it was time to say goodbye. It hurt a lot to see her leave after five years of friendship, but we had put off that moment long enough. There the boxes were waiting, each with its own label, they had all of our memories inside. We were never very serious, we liked to joke a lot and she always knew how to make me smile, today it would be hard though. After putting @ PERSON1's things in the moving van, I noticed that his dog, @ PERSON2 was not outside as he normally is. When I entered, I discovered that he hadn't been hiding there either. It was weird because @ PERSON2 was the type of dog who liked to have a lot of attention so he was always near you. When I told @ PERSON1 that @ PERSON2 was missing, we went to find him. It was @ DATE1 time, my favorite time of year and the sun was hot against my skin. I remember that moment very clearly, it was a memory I was sure I wanted to savor. As we walked along @ PERSON1 and talked about all kinds of stuff, it almost made me forget that she was going to have to leave in a few hours. Just then I noticed a shiny silver object lying in the ground from where I was standing, I couldn't quite read what the engraving said but I could see the only letter that said it all , the letter @ CAPS1. It was @ PERSON2's red and blue collar, I leaned over and picked it up, thought it must be somewhere near. Fate had to be with us that day because as soon as we looked up the road we saw @ PERSON2 driving in the back of someone's old @ ORGANIZATION1 truck. We started chasing this truck as fast as we could and we were screaming, "@ CAPS2 ! Finally the truck pulled up in front of our local store, the guy got out and he looked annoyed with us." It is my dog. "@ PERSON1 said, and I just shook my head in agreement. The strange man looked at us in wonder, then looked at @ LOCATION1. His face turned red with embarrassment when he also realized that the dog in the back didn't belong to him. This whole situation was funny and all we could do was laugh. With @ PERSON2 next to us we started walking home, taking our time, dreading what would happen when we got back to @ LOCATION2. That night I lay awake thinking about @ PERSON1 and @ LOCATION1, I was very happy with this dog for running away so we could spend more than time together. Plus I thought maybe he had a reason to leave, maybe he knew we weren't ready to say goodbye and we just had to have one last fling, one last. laugh. When we last laughed together that day, I knew we would be truly friends to always, no matter whether she lives near or far.

  In the year of @ DATE1 my brother had the worst birthday headache ever. We lived in a nice big brown house. with great to loving parents. we had a nice big back yard, my brother and I loved it the most. @ CAPS1 were stars making school lunches for my brother and me. It was my brothers first day of school and he was so happy. I mean, it's his birthday and he's also starting school on the same day, that's great. @ CAPS1 let my brother go to school with me, it was only on the road. The school my brother and I attended is called @ LOCATION1. When we got to school I could tell my brother was worried. School didn't seem so bad to me, but it wasn't me who was caught eating glue ether. Yes, my brother was caught eating glue during crafts before lunch. When I went to the office, I said it through the window. He turned his head and smiled, I could see all the glue still wet and it was all over the place. My brother and I have always had a great relationship, we both laughed at each other the whole time. If my brother and I weren't making fun of each other, we probably wouldn't be talking to each other. Laughter is a very important part of any kind of relationship to me. It allows powerful people to share their emotions in a positive way. It also helps people see what kind of humor you have. As we approached the house, we saw @ CAPS1 sitting on the porch and waiting for us. After we got home, my brother went straight to his room to clean up for his birthday. @ CAPS1 asked my brother to do the dishes and I vacuum the living room. She always wanted the house cleaned even if people didn't come. @ CAPS1 said the whole family is coming. My brother and I were so happy we both have a new grandma arriving. When everyone arrived we were both very happy. Grandmother arrived shortly after dad. @ CAPS1 was in such a rush that she wanted to see my brother's face when he saw his birthday cake. When grandma comes, she always brings gifts for both of us on birthdays. When my brother was at the table, @ CAPS1 brought the cake. I always see my brother happy, but not like this. I could tell that nothing could make her day happier. After the birthday cake and the presents, my brother and I went to the back yard to play kickball. My brother didn't want to use his new soccer ball, we were stuck with a basketball to play. @ CAPS1 and grandma were watching us play, we were both having fun. We laughed every time I kicked the ball badly, or if he missed when he tried to kick the ball. As we were kicking the ball, I got an idea. I put my leg back and as the ball approached I kicked it. I kicked the ball so hard and so fast that instead of the ball going to his feet, it went to his head. When the ball connected to his head, he did a back flip from the ground. @ CAPS1 and grandmother were in aw, I was still frozen. When he got up he looked me straight in the eye and laughed. @ CAPS1 started to laugh, just like grandma, I was still frozen. I finally got there and by the time I started I couldn't stop. it was so funny he got picked up off the ground and hit his head with a bullet and he's still laughing. When it was time for everyone to go @ CAPS1 said goodbye, then it was the grandmothers' turn. Grandma gave my brother the first kiss on the forehead that I did. As Grandma was leaving my brother and I sat on Mom's lap and gave her a big hug and said "I love you @ CAPS1". @ CAPS1 was putting us to bed and about to leave when my brother said "@ CAPS1 I have a headache". I love my family and even today we look back and laugh. It has been a joy to write, I hope you think so. Short story by @ ORGANIZATION1 @ NUM1

 Laughter, what is the meaning ; show mirth, joy or contempt with a giggle or explosive vocal sound. Laughing people in their lives go through stages of depression or feel a sadness inside of them; they never seem to be able to find the light at the end of the tunnel, "the light being happiness". @ MONTH1 days turn into months or even years, life seems to have come to a standstill. When you feel that there is no happiness, you start to have doubts about your decisions in life; the choices you have made in life all seem bad. This is what my life was like when the world turned around and I found out my best friend had just overturned her car. I was traumatized, in shock; I had no idea that so many things could rush through your head at that time. I immediately started asking a million questions to see if she was okay. All they could share with me at the time was that she was rushed to the hospital. All I could do when I got home was lie in my bed and think; what could I have done to prevent her from being in that car - all I felt was guilt! That night has been miserable, my mind kept thinking about all the times my best friend and I had together, the laughs we shared among ourselves, the stupid fights and all the stupid pranks. What gnawed at me the most was that we had fought shortly before she was wrecked; the worst was that it was for the dumbest thing. I had gotten mad at her for constantly giving up on our plans we had together to hang out with her boyfriend. Come to think of it, all I felt was jealousy. If only I could take it all back, then maybe she wouldn't have been distracted while she was driving and missed her turn. The next morning her mom called me and said "she asks you, you @ MOIS1 come to the hospital and see her please." I was ecstatic, I prepared myself faster than ever before; in a few minutes I was ready and in my pickup I was on my way to the hospital @ LOCATION1. It only took me thirty-five minutes to get there, when it should take you about forty-five. I immediately jumped out of my truck, rushed to the hospital, and went to the check-in counter to see which room she would be in. They told me she was in room @ NUM1 just down the hall on the left. I got to room @ NUM1, there was a crack in the door so I took a look before trying to open the door the rest of the way; I finally had the confidence to open the door and go talk to him. She immediately had a smile on her face when she saw me, I pulled up a chair and sat down right next to her. We talked for about an hour about random things; including the wreck. She told me she had a few broken tears and a minor concussion so she should be able to go out that afternoon. When she told me that, I was one of the happiest people at the time. All I could do was laugh when she told me everything was fine; almost like a laugh of relief. It wasn't long before we both started laughing, mostly out of excitement and nothing more to say; except the beautiful sound of laughter that comes out of our mouths. I have to say it was good to be next to my friends again and to be able to share happy moments with each other. So what is the meaning of laughter for me ; you will ask? It is the most meaningful thing anyone can do. Laughter is showing signs of happiness, a giggle or a fit of anger; share unforgettable moments with a loved one, without laughing your life cannot be complete, make jokes, just laugh so that life has meaning again. Don't spend your life being @ PERSON2, be @ PERSON1 instead. Go ahead, test it and see what laughter can do for you in your life!

 @ CAPS4 all my life I have been a child of laughter, the one who did everything @ CAPS5 could to find the joy of existing. As I grew older, @ CAPS4's thirst for fun has not ceased, and when I fell through a metal roof a few years ago, @ CAPS4's joyful obsession remained. . The woman who gave me life is an only child. @ CAPS5 has a few step-siblings, but it's a crew we never see. When I think of those close to @ CAPS4, these people never think of @ CAPS4. In fact, I don't even remember them. This fact makes @ CAPS4's childhood seem empty or vacant (given that @ CAPS4's father passed away when I was a toddler), but there's no need to feel any sympathy for me. I mean, sure, growing up in a low income household, with a single mom and two young kids was a tough thing to deal with, but I managed to get through it. Have you ever had a best friend that you considered part of your family in some way? That's all mom @ CAPS4 had. Unlike me, her only savior in life was her closest confidant, @ PERSON1. @ CAPS5 and @ CAPS4 mom were best friends since before high school - even before anyone thought of me. @ PERSON1 has always been there for us. @ CAPS5 was even alongside @ CAPS4's mom when I was born. I'm sure as a teenager having babies was something strange, but just two years after @ CAPS4 arrived, @ PERSON1 found herself giving birth to her own beautiful daughter, @ PERSON2. Since then, they have been part of the @ CAPS4 family ; @ CAPS4 aunt and cousin. Throughout @ CAPS4's childhood, I grew up in a house. Throughout the years that I have resided there, @ PERSON1 and her daughter have taken advantage of several opportunities to join us. I used to share a room with @ PERSON2, and we fought like rivals, but we loved each other like sisters. @ CAPS4's brother was born five years after me and three years after @ PERSON2. @ CAPS6 was always too small for us to play with, so having other girls in the house was handy. Both of them served as a family that I never had ... but it wasn't always such a dandy thing. @ PERSON2 and I have done a lot of cruel fights in our day, but I never once thought that our fights might make them leave us. One @ DATE1 @ TIME1, on a hot bare day I woke up to find these missing @ CAPS4 people in life. They were gone. About a year has passed and we haven't seen them. @ PERSON1 is not passed. @ CAPS5 did not send a letter. It was as if they were falling from @ LOCATION1's face. @ CAPS4's heart was injured, but it was quickly healed. Our landline started ringing one evening, and to our surprise, @ PERSON1 was on the other line : "We just moved in. You have to come and see our new place." @ CAPS1, it was like nothing between the two adults was going wrong. When we arrived to visit them in their new adobe, @ PERSON2 took me to a friend's house to climb their shed. I didn't object, I wanted to be friends again ... but if I had known what to expect, I wouldn't have left. As we walked from the crime scene and along the mile road, the most you could hear from our direction was @ sobbing CAPS4. A young boy who didn't look much older than me turned the corner in front of us. When @ CAPS6 saw what a mess I was, @ CAPS6 laughed. "@ CAPS2 is no fun !" I cried. His expression turned serious, "@ CAPS3, I ... what happened?" @ CAPS4's face was too buried in @ CAPS4's hands for me to speak, so @ PERSON2 took over, "@ CAPS5 fell through a metal roof !" We were both thinking about it, but neither of us said a word, "Asshole!" @ CAPS6 got on well and offered a helping hand, but I pushed him away. The more @ PERSON2 and I paced the cement stump, the more tolerable the injuries to @ CAPS4's body became. "@ CAPS7", glancing at @ PERSON2, I smiled, "@ CAPS6 was really cute", I rocked @ CAPS4's face in embarrassment. @ PERSON2 blushed, agreeing with @ CAPS4's opinion. "And that sucks because I'm crying, dirty, limping, and there's a huge bloody mess ... and the world still works the @ CAPS2 way ! Of course I would run into a guy cute that looks like @ CAPS2 ! " @ CAPS4's cousin laughed ; @ CAPS5 thoroughly, amused by me. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but something that happened in the situation tickled @ CAPS4's inner stomach, and I laughed as @ CAPS3. We both spent the rest of the distance laughing at the incident and sharing stories similar to our problem. Thinking back to all of @ CAPS2, I would like to think that being a young, unintelligent, naive teenager brought cousin @ CAPS4 and myself to common ground, but then I would be lying. In all fairness, that was our laughter. Even in the most frightening and tense situations around the world, laughing for any reason makes a person feel better. Laughter heals feelings, arouses thoughts and brings people together.

Hot @ CAPS1 Laughs @ MONTH1 is the best medicine, but it's also @ MONTH1 the best glue. When we laugh, especially with the other, it brings a feeling of relaxation and happiness. Laughter is a release of fun, and it literally means “not to think”. Right now, people are opening up and it brings a warm feeling of the heart that is shared among them. Without that connection or the ability to joke, people start to overthink and become overly critical of relationships. Flirting is making fun or alleviating a situation, the goal is to put people at ease so that they @ MONTH1 open up. Flirting can consist of several things, such as joking, impressing, or complimenting; this usually leads to excessive laughter or chuckling. When this warm connection begins, so does the bond between people, as was the case with my own girlfriend. I had just come out of a painful experience with another girl, so I became hard of heart. I was a little nervous, so when she started to be nice and nice to me, I started to come out of my shell and laugh with her. Our first date was to see a silly yo-yo that had come to their church. It was a great way to start what we've been building for two years now, as well as a comfortable setting to meet the parents. Sometimes the key to opening up, or connecting, is to make a fool of yourself. It's hard to laugh with someone who is proud or overly analytical; laughter is a crucial mental break from routine thinking. Being an asshole @ MONTH1 is just the best way to be in a healthy relationship. My relationship is very well balanced between mutual support, being critical and being silly. I make sacrifices to make her laugh, and she does the same for me, but most of the time it causes us both to be abundantly happy and laugh together. Being a man isn't the same as being stubborn or powerful, I think it's more about being open and compassionate. In order to be open enough to have someone to laugh with, you have to be able to laugh at themselves. Laughter is a @ CAPS2, a device for social transformation, and it spreads quickly. The same goes for a simple social gathering. Does anyone become the “party life” without laughing at themselves? Usually they are the ones who go out of their way to be ridiculous to everyone, because once it starts it spreads exponentially. Being comfortable is the basis for having a good time, otherwise people get paranoid, refuse to participate, and seem downright cold. The lively tone of laughter is a good way to make people feel comfortable and relaxed. Think of people like @ CAPS1. @ CAPS1 is difficult to pour and spread in cold weather, it is thick and condensed. You can't do much with cold @ CAPS1, so you have to heat it up. You can't heat @ CAPS1 in the blink of an eye, otherwise it might get tasteless, but once it is gradually heated, it becomes easy to spread and very useful. This warm @ CAPS1 quickly mixes up with just about anything and sticks to things just the same. My relationship has been sticky, sweet and warm beyond comparison, but nothing without a little work or a little laughter.

         The @ CAPS1 and the benefits of @ CAPS2 are truly an important thing in life. Laughter brightens the mood and makes you happier. If people laugh more often, their days are happier, lighter, and much shorter. Small children are the ones who laugh the most. Making adults laugh is not very easy because they are more serious. There are a lot of stories where laughter is the main element. Laughter can connect with many other pleasurable elements, such as being happy or happy. I once read a story about a little girl named @ CAPS3 who loved to make people happy. And out of joy, we made people laugh more often. And through laughter, the sick became healthier and stopped being sick. Laughter is made up of many different factors. For example, being happy leads to laughing more, to being happy and of course to smiling more. When you fall to the ground and a stranger, for example, is smiling at you, you feel happier and maybe your mood will clear up. The morning has risen to be gray and rainy. The people of the house woke up irritable and cranky. Everything was going backwards. No one was smiling. Breakfast was very monotonous, as no one wanted to talk. It looked like the day was going to end like this. @ CAPS4 was also very cranky that day. She didn't want to go to school at all. She was mad at everyone and everything. She was mad about the rain. The rain was her worst enemy because then she couldn't go out for a walk with her friends. She was angry with her maid for forgetting to fill her jug with lukewarm water, as she always did. She was angry with her little sister for taking her blue hair ribbons. To tell the truth, she was mad at everyone, and she didn't even think that if she had been happier today, then everything would look good. Okay, so she still had to go to school, whether she wanted to or not. At school, the little teacher was happy as usual. She wasn't cranky at all, although it was a rainy and dreary day. Some of the students had the same mood as the teacher, but there were very few of them. Schoolwork seemed endless at @ CAPS4, especially his math. But that all changed after the professor told everyone it was story time. The story was about an orphan little girl who had to go live with her wicked parents. But she was not at all affected by their moods. She was very simple and always happy. Over time, the people she visited (especially the sick and the elderly) began to be happy, just like her. And when she had to leave this village, everyone was sad to see her go. With lightness and happiness, the young girl left the most precious gift, to be always happy, which made her laugh more often. Even when she was gone, a passing stranger could still hear happiness and laughter. And it was even nice to stay in this place for a bit before continuing your trip. Because passers-by have always felt much healthier from laughing. After the teacher finished the story, @ CAPS4 thought, why wouldn't she try to cheer up her family ? Even though it was raining, that didn't mean everyone had to be dark. So after school was over @ CAPS4 ran home to cheer everyone up. In @ TIME1, when everyone had finished their chores for the day and relaxed, laughter could be heard through the windows. Looks like @ CAPS4 also found a way to make their household laugh. The story she heard earlier today has helped her today and throughout her long life. She remembered this special rule of happiness at home. And always in his house there was happiness and laughter, even on really dark and gloomy days. We can see that this little factor, which doesn't seem like big to us @ CAPS1, made @ CAPS4's life happier. Hope this little factor can help you too.

 It was the first day of the second year. I had just moved into @ LOCATION1 during @ DATE1 so I was nervous about the new school like any kid would be. I walked into the school and checked the surroundings of @ CAPS4. Everything seemed pretty normal until I saw it. Near the middle of the sea of tables in the cafeteria, there were about four tables with about @ NUM1 people each, but it was @ CAPS5 the fact that they were there that caught @ CAPS4's attention. what they were doing. They were fighting with cards @ CAPS1- @ CAPS2- @ CAPS3 right in the middle of the cafeteria where everyone could see! I was baffled, I mean I used to fight when I was younger in elementary school when the game was newer, but I had to quit because everyone in the @ CAPS4 school has stopped fighting, and here I am looking at least @ NUM2 high school kids just dueling one way. What surprised me the most was that they were there, out in the open, where everyone could see, and worse than anything to judge. I moved to a table near them and started watching a kid named @ PERSON1 (who later became one of @ CAPS4's best friends.) Mop the floor with his opponent. I quickly picked up most of the rules and came home that day thinking "I'm going to get back to the game!" So I bought a deck and continued the @ CAPS4 table scouting, the @ CAPS4 deck sitting in front of me waiting for someone to challenge their master. A few days passed as I continued the silent observation of the @ CAPS4 duelists. Finally, a duelist named @ CAPS5.J (another from @ CAPS4 now good friends) challenged me. I accepted and I started. He then kicked @ CAPS4 hard in the space of what appeared to be five laps into the game. @ PERSON1 then taught me how to play better and we became best friends. He's a really funny guy, and to this day I can't hang out with him without laughing. Thanks to him, I have met tons of good friends. Even now I wonder what life in high school @ CAPS4 would be like if they didn't @ CAPS5 attended the new school @ CAPS4.

JJ @ NUM1 Laughs @ CAPS1 people @ MONTH1 say that laughter is not important in a relationship, but I think it is. Laughter can always lighten the mood no matter what it is, @ MONTH1 laughter only lasts a few seconds but it's okay as long as it's there. Maybe you're laughing at something funny, or just because you're tired. My cousin and I laugh for both of these reasons every time we are together. There are a lot of stories I could tell you about laughing with my cousin. @ CAPS1 of the best to arrive in @ ORGANIZATION1 ! We have @ CAPS1 having a pretty fun time in there. Like the other day, we went to @ ORGANIZATION1 with a friend of ours. Our friend went to get some candy @ CAPS1 and, as she was leaving us, my cousin and I ran away. As we were running away and hiding or as we call it "being ninjas", we couldn't stop laughing the gap time. She tried to call and find us, but we didn't answer and didn't let her see us. Then my cousin and I saw her walking the other way, so we ran behind her and scared her. It was one of the many times that laughter was part of my life.

One day I woke up @ CAPS6 looking out my window and listening to the birds chirping out my window. I usually leave my window open to sleep with fresh air because I hate breathing in my own breath it's hot anyway when I wake up @ CAPS6 I walked out and ate crispy rice with my sisters @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON3. As I was about to finish, I realized I was late for school. I was only in @ NUM1 grade so I ran, got dressed and told my sisters to @ CAPS5 and get ready, but you don't know how girls can put @ CAPS4 out there do - @ CAPS6 and do the hair there. My sister @ PERSON2 was in @ NUM2 grade and my other sister was in @ NUM3 grade our schools were right next to each other so they finally got ready and we were @ CAPS4 our way to school ready for an awesome day with my teacher @ PERSON4hawk. She wasn't the nicest teacher in the world but I only loved her because when we were cleaning our office she gave us shaving cream and me and my friend @ PERSON1 would have so much fun playing in the cream. We started the day with a book and the book was from "@ CAPS1 fault" I can't remember the name but I remember the cover was gold and it was about ghouls and monsters as she read it. was like we were there this book was so intense even though i really didn't understand it. Then she would give us a math worksheet that I was familiar with in math @ NUM1 but I was really smart in math and she would always choose me @ CAPS4 and give me math more difficult than others and when I asked her why I was getting harder in math then the other kids she told me I was different. I knew I was smarter than some kids, but not all of them, so I never knew if it was an add-on or an insult, but I really didn't care. So now that we've got that sorted out we can move on to the fun part where all the laughs are so school is over and I'm trying to find my sister to take me home, after @ NUM5 min looking for me Find her walking to the crosswalk, I shout her name "@ CAPS2". She looks and I run to her and her friends because no she didn't want to be seen with an annoying little brother so she ran across the street. My dad was waiting in the car and my sister got to the car before me and I was in a @ CAPS5 to get to the car and had to wait for the cross guard lady to make me @ CAPS3. Finally, she finally noticed me, I was @ CAPS4 hurriedly walking to the car because I had gathered my dad up shouting "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6" so I walked more and more. faster and as I was walking, I remotely rounded up a car driving down the street, but what I hadn't noticed was that it was heading straight for me. The car came flying around the corner and almost hit the lady of the cross guard, the car had hit the crossing stick without me being hit while flying and driving down the street. I got hit and bruised every time my panicked dad got out of the car yelling at the lady who hit me and getting her license plate number. As I was laying @ CAPS4 on the floor my dad came up to me and was trying to get me @ CAPS6 he pulled my pants down to see the damage and I remember I had my scooby-doo underwear on @ CAPS4 and everyone was looking at me I was more embarrassed than hurt I only felt the pain the next day so everything was fine I couldn't walk so my dad ran put me in the car and everyone got away laughed at me because they saw my @ CAPS4 underwear and my daddy rushed me home then called the ambulance. they told my dad that I would be able to walk again but would have a hard time playing sports because I have a broken hip. I was living the dream of my sisters spoiling me by giving me candy and my dad by giving me ice cream and @ CAPS4 on top of that I couldn't feel the pain. But the firefighter said I should be able to go to school the next day and I did and my mean old teacher saw me and I was limping and what she said made me angry, she told me to stop pretending. I told my mom and she got so crazy you wouldn't want to be that teacher so let's say it wasn't pretty. You're probably wondering what happened to the lady who hit me, she's paying my doctor bills.

 My knees were weak and my hands were shaking slightly as my rapid heart rate increased the speed and timing of my breathing. I wanted to end it, but at the same time, I had no intention of starting a conversation, yet alone, @ CAPS3 him. It had been quite a @ DATE1 since I had seen my dad and I wasn't sure whether to expect a relaxed and laid back man or a tense and cranky man. So, I closed my eyes, took some deep breaths and decided to hand this over to @ CAPS1. It was obvious that once I saw my dad it would be a natural thing to talk to him, but I was suspicious of his mood and if it would affect mine! If for some reason this happened for the worst, we probably wouldn't be best friends in the world for a few weeks. He would then continue to pull the "@ CAPS2 now thinks @ CAPS2 is a teenager, can @ CAPS2 do and act like @ CAPS2 wants?" Or the, "I'm your father, I deserve more respect!" @ CAPS3, the funny thing is I never start any of these things. He chooses to start them when he's bored, I guess. Then he continues to make me feel bad for his wrongdoing. When my mom, sister and I got to the airport, (I'm not going to lie) I wanted to come home. My sister was making a few jokes here and there and my mom would let her mind shine on me; even in the haze of it all, they could only give me a little chuckle because I was letting my nerves get the better of me. I didn't want my last three months of @ DATE1 to be ruined by his coming home. But once I looked back at everything I had done: two weeks at @ LOCATION1, rafting etc, I realized I missed him and wanted him to come back. Don't get me wrong my dad is a super nice, funny and hardworking guy, it's just hard to work with him sometimes. My father's flight had landed, and after a good hour of waiting, he got off the plane. We could @ CAPS3 his eyes frantically roam the airport for us, and when he found us he put the warmest, friendliest smile I have ever seen on his face. Tears came to his eyes as my sister ran towards him and my mother quickly walked behind him. My legs carried me towards him and I quickly discovered that my sister and I were competing to be the first to kiss him! A hundred feet has never been so close and yet so far. Panting, we reached him with heavy legs and full hearts, now that we were with him. The good thing is that an awkward moment never appeared. He knocked, but we didn't let him through the door; instead, laughter has come in its place. All my troubles and worries were gone when he opened his mouth, and those soothing waves of laughter came out and were welcomed into our ears. My heart rose and my smile lit up. I knew my dad couldn't be gone any longer. I love it! Laughter soothes the soul and brings joy in any situation. He is kind and does not regret anything. The only mistake is not to risk laughing in the first place. Laughter is one of the many things that keep me so close to my dad today. Our sense of humor when we're together is never boring and is unforgettable. I entrust my life to him and since I was born he has found a way to make the most of every situation through laughter. @ CAPS2 can count on their laughter to make anyone smile and it is without a doubt the most contagious thing @ CAPS2 will ever hear. “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,” including my dad and me.

 The first day I met her I knew @ CAPS4 was the right dog for me. His black and white fur was as soft as cotton, and his eyes as brown as the bark of a tree. @ CAPS4 had an authentic personality that no other dog could have. Which was something I could say right away @ CAPS4 was the dog for me. Over the next two months our friendship developed, as I taught him to talk, smile, stand on two legs and dance with me. A black lab, @ PERSON1, instantly became his best friend, as the two ran around the property barking and playing. Every night the two snuggle up next to each other and sleep. The times @ CAPS1 (my new dog) would lay on his side and relax, I called him an oreo. Her average belly was white and her sides were black, making her look like a deep breathing oreo @ CAPS1. @ CAPS5 where its name came from. The seventh month had gone by quickly, but it was nice everyday with my @ CAPS1 by my side. @ CAPS4 gave me the best comfort when I needed it, always giving me a smile when the day was rainy, or sleep next to me when I wasn't feeling the best. It was like @ CAPS4 was my own special dose of medicine, his presence made me feel good again. Her love had become deeply rooted in all of our hearts in this house and @ CAPS4 was one of a kind, but something started to change about her over the days. Her food bowl was almost full every time we fed her, @ CAPS4 would no longer work with @ PERSON1, @ CAPS4 would no longer speak, and @ CAPS4 would no longer smile. I knew something was wrong. We didn't know @ CAPS4 was sick until it was too late. On the first day, @ CAPS4 had vomited blood. It was then that concerns started between my boyfriend, his mother and me. We wanted to find a vet to help him, but neither of us had the money to do so. On the second day of @ TIME1, I couldn't find @ CAPS1 anywhere on the property. I thought @ CAPS4 might have just wandered around the outskirts of the house, until she hit @ NUM1 pm and there was still no sign of her. The panic spread throughout my body and I gave up looking for it and turned to @ PERSON1. "@ PERSON1", I looked her straight in the eye, "I know you can hear me." @ CAPS4 looked at me with big brown eyes and wagged his tail. "@ CAPS5 is @ CAPS1, @ PERSON1 ?" I knew @ CAPS4 caught me as @ CAPS4 started sniffing around the property and suddenly, as if @ CAPS4 had picked up a trail, followed a scent line to an old opal car. @ PERSON1 wagged its tail, looked at me and turned around under the car. There @ CAPS1 looked sick. So I took her back to the property for my boyfriend's mom to look at. We didn't know if it was poisoning or something. So we called an animal expert and asked him. @ CAPS4 said that most likely looked like parvo, since we had not yet @ CAPS1 gotten his parvo shot. So overnight, to help her feel better, my boyfriend and I stayed awake pouring water into her dehydrated body and spinach juice on her hoping that would help, but all that @ CAPS4 wanted to do was sleep. So we left her alone in peace and decided to watch her in @ TIME1. In @ TIME1 my boyfriend had to go to work and I was left alone with @ CAPS1 to take care of her. I sang songs to him as @ CAPS4 was lying on the porch looking sad and desperate I patted his head telling him how @ CAPS4 was my best friend and favorite dog that meant so much to me , and I told him that I loved him. I tried to get her to eat but @ CAPS4 would only throw it up. Finally, after a day of crying next to her, I noticed that @ CAPS4 was still walking towards the pond behind the house and sitting there. It made me want to check her butt. As I pulled his tail up, I noticed a large bloody hole with flies coming out of @ CAPS5. @ CAPS4 was rotting from the inside out. I cried. It was time to decide whether to put her down or not, and me, my boyfriend and his dad just watched her watching her in pain. It was time. As soon as we got to the vet's office they took her inside and laid her down on a table @ CAPS5 I was told to hold her while they overdosed her with anesthesia. it was only a few seconds before @ CAPS4 disappeared and everyone in the room was silent and i cried over her limp body which was no longer smiling. We dug a hole and buried it under the tree that @ CAPS4 was playing under. "@ CAPS1 my mom bear. @ NUM2 @ CAPS11 @ CAPS12 you are in heaven."

Fishing Trip Gone Wrong @ CAPS1 introduces me to what I'm going to tell you about today, fishing. Fishing has been an integral part of @ CAPS7's life since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with @ CAPS7's dad and brother to go fishing. @ CAPS7 dad loved to take us fishing in the lake. I fished all the lakes around these parts. When I was five I got a brand new @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 fishing rod it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing reel. There was even some chrome going up on the handle so when the sun just hit it it was casting a bright beam of light @ CAPS18 on the ground. Well, as I got older the @ CAPS7 fishing rod did the same. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to. When I shot @ MONEY1 @ CAPS7 the pole was broken and just didn't work for @ CAPS7's fishing needs. So @ CAPS18 on the 10th anniversary of @ CAPS7, @ CAPS7 family and friends gave me money. I told them I wanted to buy a new fishing rod @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. So after @ CAPS7's birthday, I had acquired one hundred and @ MONEY1. I thought I was the richest man in the whole world. Later that night, Dad @ CAPS7 came to me and told me that the marriage of cousins of @ @ DATE1 CAPS7 was this and that we might have time to fish after @ CAPS15 a bit. I went into the garage and packed the tackle box @ CAPS7 with pliers, hooks, spinners, and all the fishing gear I would need. After marriage cousins of @ CAPS7's father said CAPS7 @ "@ CAPS6 goes fishing." @ CAPS7 dad and I put on our fishing clothes and off we went but remembered I needed a fishing rod so I asked "@ CAPS8 dad we need to stop quickly at @ ORGANIZATION1 ". It turned out that there was an @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS18 on the way. We pulled into the parking lot of @ ORGANIZATION1 and I walked in. I ran over to the sporting goods and found the last fishing rod @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 on the shelf @ CAPS18, so I took it down and looked at it. It was the pole for me, the only downside was the price which was seventy @ MONEY1. I bought it anyway. I walked out of the store with @ CAPS7 the new @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 fishing rod feeling like I was a million dollars. Arriving at our fishing spot, I noticed that we were not near a lake but a large river. @ CAPS7 dad explained that I have to be safe around the river because you can get swept away if you fall in it. I got out of our car and the wind was strong. It was cold to the bones. I took out a new rod and tackle box @ CAPS7 and started installing the @ CAPS7 rod for river fishing. I put @ CAPS18 a big weight and a big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought so. I then reached into the big red tackle box @ CAPS7 and pulled out a big worm. "I think the fish will love this." I say aloud to @ CAPS7 daddy. Watch the fast flowing water and cast the @ CAPS7 bait fishing line offshore. A big splash of water then ripples, @ CAPS7 dad and I are smiling in satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried in the embankment. Lowering the @ CAPS7 post fairly gently, I watch daddy @ CAPS7 as he pulls a fish. Well @ CAPS18 our way down to the river, there was this dependency @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14. I needed to use the toilet, I turned to @ CAPS7 on the right and said to @ CAPS7 daddy "@ CAPS15 don't lose the fishing rod @ CAPS7 I don't want him to fly into the river if I get a big fish @ CAPS18. " @ CAPS7 dad replies" @ CAPS17, @ CAPS17 is already going to the bathroom. " @ CAPS18 @ CAPS7 walk to the bathroom Didn't see the big @ CAPS19 that landed near the @ CAPS7 fishing line. @ CAPS7 dad saw them getting closer and closer to the @ CAPS7 line, so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I step out of the bathroom, daddy @ CAPS7 runs and waves his arms at @ CAPS19. They all fly up in the air, but something drags behind one of them weighs them down. What did you ask @ MONTH1 ? This was the brand new fishing rod from @ CAPS7 ! It was at least @ NUM1 maybe @ NUM2 feet in the air. As soon as the @ CAPS7 pole took off, it started to fall. It didn't land on the bank @ CAPS18 but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. @ CAPS7 dad looks at me and says with a smile "This is the first fishing rod I have ever seen fly." I laugh uncontrollably, then @ CAPS7's daddy starts to crack. After the laugh, @ CAPS7 dad looked @ CAPS18 shore for something with @ CAPS7 pole, but to @ CAPS7's surprise he found it @ CAPS18 shore down river.Will @ CAPS20

 @ DATE1 my birthday my boyfriend @ PERSON2 took me to @ LOCATION1 at @ ORGANIZATION2. I had never been there, it was exciting and a new dining experience for me. My dad had promised me he would take me because it was my birthday @ NUM1 and he wasn't there for my birthday @ NUM2. But he forgot, so my dad's girlfriend called the restaurant and told the manager it was my birthday and give me whatever I wanted and just charge it to his credit card. This is where the adventure of mine and @ PERSON2 began. The start of our adventure. Drive on the old secondary roads of @ CAPS1 in the old @ ORGANIZATION1 in the direction of @ LOCATION1. Just @ PERSON2 and I, the roads were wet with the mid-afternoon dew, the trees with their beautiful leaves all different colors of red, green and orange. Bounce in the hollows of the old road. @ NUM3 bumpin 'on the stereo, singing only the parts we know. When we got to @ CAPS2 we got lost because we took the wrong exit and ended up at @ LOCATION2 on the other side of where we were supposed to be. Being lost in a city much bigger than @ PERSON1 or @ CAPS1 was not good, we had no idea where we were. The first place we went was a mall which had a big party store. we go inside and their @ CAPS4 decorations as far as the eye can see. Monsters, Whitches and Goblins. We were caught off guard by all the scary things that I realized I had to use the bathroom for. While I was going to the bathroom, @ PERSON2 asked one of the store clerks where we could find this @ CAPS5. The guy tells us he's never heard of a place like this. So we went into @ ORGANIZATION1, there was a lady getting out of her car so we asked her. She said yes, it's just a few streets away. As we drove on the freeway, we couldn't find it anywhere. Somehow we're lost again, so we find another alliance store on top of that really big hill. we didn't think little @ ORGANIZATION1 could make such a big hill. We got to the top, walked inside and asked the clerk to search his phone for where we needed to go. While we waited all I could think of was how much my feet hurt in these shoes. We got the address and set off again for our research. About twenty minutes later we still had no luck finding this restaurant and to top it off we had a reservation so we couldn't be late. We find another alliance store and @ PERSON2 ran to ask. The receptionist told us to take the highway back. I was like no, no, stay on that road. We followed the deserted road and just around the corner it was @ CAPS5. We were glad we finally found it and we weren't even late. All @ PERSON2 and I could do was laugh because we were so frustrated finding this stupid place it was so funny you couldn't help but laugh. It brought @ PERSON2 closer together and I got closer as we overcame this laughing instead of fighting. And that we have our funny adventure story.

Since I was born laughter has been a big part of my life without it, I would be a very boring and cranky person. Even though I have experienced many moments full of laughter, a specific moment always comes to mind. About a year ago my mom and I took a trip to @ LOCATION1 to visit family. It was the first time we had been there in over twelve years as my mother and I could not visit them due to immigration issues. After all the difficult years, my mother and I were able to obtain our legal residency in the United States. As soon as we got the residence, we were free and could go and visit his family without having to come back illegally. When my mom and I got to the airport from @ LOCATION1 my mom started crying because she was full of emotions, for the first time in twelve years she was going to see her mom, dad, brothers and sisters. As soon as we went through all the airport security and baggage claim formalities, we headed for the exit where my grandfather had agreed to pick us up. When we got outside the airport, a little red @ ORGANIZATION1 started moving closer and closer to my mom and me. The car was no further than 40 feet away when my mom suddenly dropped her luggage and started running towards the little red car I had. no idea who the elderly person was driving the car. When the car pulled up an elderly man got out of the vehicle and gave my mom one of the longest, most heartwarming hugs I have ever known in my life, they must have kissed for at least fifteen minutes crying on each other's shoulders. When they are done hugging, my mom calls my name and I start walking towards her. When I was face to face with my mom and the older man my mom told me the man was my grandfather then she looks at her dad and tells him to meet her grandson. For the first time in a very long time I had a grandfather, I was in shock for a while and so did he. He was amazed at how much I had changed and how much I had changed in the twelve long, difficult years he had gone without seeing me or having contact with me. When I reached out to give him a hug, he hugged me tight and didn't let go, he told me that today had been the happiest day of his life. My grandfather and I started to load the luggage into his car so that we could go home to meet the rest of my family. When we finished loading everything into the car, we drove home. The long drive back home was a bit strange and uncomfortable as there wasn't much chatting in the car. It was about a fifty minute ride back when we reached our destination in a small town outside of @ LOCATION1 called texcoco. It was a nice, clean little town with lots of little shops and lots of middle class two story houses, the streets full of cars and people walking or cycling very different from what I was used to in the States- United. When we got to our house there was a group of about 20 people who were family and friends outside the door waiting for us. When we were done with our seedlings and finished meeting all of our parents, we got together and had dinner as a family. One of my uncles really stood out because he was really funny and always acted like a clown, he was the one who set the mood in the house or wherever he went. As the days went by, I got more and more comfortable with the people around me and started to have fun. About two weeks ago my uncle @ CAPS1 invited me to one of his comedy shows. that day i experienced more laughter than ever before his jokes were original and true. In cunclusion, laughter is one of the elements of life without me being able to be happy.

 It's my sophomore year and some of my friends were going to try softball. After some thought, I joined and fell in love with this sport. I'm not that good, but as they say practice makes perfect. We all laugh and have a great time and everyone loves everyone and it's fun to be part of a team that always laughs and has a great time together. It's about a time my friends and I started laughing so hard we almost started crying and now it's one of our little jokes between all of us girls. Once my friends and I were catching pop flies and it was my turn to go catch the ball. I went there jumping and just being my normal weird self. They hit the ball and it started coming towards me and I ran towards it and I slipped and fell right on my butt. Everyone including me started to laugh because I fell in the mud and got dirty. About ten minutes later we were all standing there talking about how funny it was when I fell and how it made everyone's day. Then I saw mud on the ground and wanted to roll in it but didn't want to just lay down and start rolling in the mud. So I asked my friend @ PERSON1 to push me through the mud so I could fall and roll in. After she pushed me through the mud, I stood up and started laughing out loud. My knees were covered in mud, as were my buttocks and legs. They all started saying who turned away from you because we're not out loud to swear, so we did something else to replace it. Now when I walk down the halls and see someone from the softball team we both start laughing and saying who has walked away from you in the middle of what we're doing right now- the. This is my first year playing sports in high school and I'm glad I did because I'm having so much fun. When this ends in a few months, I'm going to be really upset. All of these girls and I have become so close over the past @ NUM1 weeks that they are like family to me now. Most of us just knew each other and weren't really friends and never spoke at all, but now we all do. We like to do silly things like random singing in the locker room or making the silliest jokes possible. But we all have fun and we don't care. We had a lot of laughs and more to come this season. Like when we have matches on the buses or even in training. We have an amazing sofa that makes us laugh and make jokes every day. This season should be interesting for all of us because we all love to laugh and joke and sing and have a good time with each other and that's all that matters to make a good softball team and a good season.

The benefits of laughter Laughter has always occupied an important place in my life. Most of the relationships I have with my friends are great because I can make them laugh and cheer them up when they're feeling down. When a person laughs it makes them completely forget everything that brought them down, and now they only focus on what made them laugh and feel that joy and happiness. When you laugh, the only thing you think about is the thing that made you laugh, nothing else. laughter in many cases has brought people from low self esteem to high self esteem in a very short time. One example where laughter was very beneficial to one person was with a friend of mine. A good friend of mine seemed really depressed and didn't want to talk about what was going on with anyone. With him not telling anyone what was wrong, that leaves you guessing, what could have happened? After about a week of isolating himself from others, he was ready to talk and spend time with some of his close friends, including me. Me and two other people who were friends with me and him decided to go golfing which was a new hobby for us. It was on this day that he told us how his mother had been cheating on his father for over a year and that she also hid alcohol in all kinds of places. and drank too much. By just being with his friends, laughing and having fun, he found himself focusing on things other than what was wrong in his life. Even laughing at yourself can be a great way to deal with your problems. even when it seems like nothing is going well in your life, something will always be right, you just need to give it time. The moral of the story I just told is that no matter how sad you feel, laughing can always help ease the pain. Even laughing at a bad situation can make you feel better.

 Laughter is an integral part of everyone's life. It is used to express many different emotions. It is used to bridge the gap between people and to break down the awkward barrier. People laugh at their own mistakes, which shows others that they too are making mistakes. Some people can communicate through laughter and know how the other is feeling. For example, once when I was on a long drive and was very bored and about to fall asleep. So out of nowhere I started laughing with my friend and laughing in different ways and had a whole conversation just laughing. Laughter can bring others together by sharing common interests; everybody laughs. I laugh more than the others I'm sure. Laughter is a huge part of my life, honestly without it my life would be boring and depressing. I laugh so much sometimes that my side and my stomach hurt so much. I also make a lot of mistakes and I am very clumsy so people make fun of me a lot. My family is a very close and hilarious family, we make a lot of mistakes constantly every day. For my great-grandmother's @ DATE1, we were planning a surprise party. While we were making it my grandma kept getting suspicious and asking what we were doing. So we kept telling her we were going to find her a stripper for her @ DATE1. So we were able to convince my uncle Bobby to become a stripper and get out of a club and that's what he did and it ended up scaring my grandma. Until this day, we still talk about that day and laugh about it all the time. Every day my aunt acts in a silly and funny way and so most of the time I laugh at her. She always dances to music in commercials or sings operas. My great-grandmother always eats foods that make her gas, and it's hilarious because sometimes she doesn't even realize she's doing it. My great-grandmother also loves dancing and it's also hilarious because the dance moves she knows are so different from today. I believe that without laughing my family would not be as close as we are. Without laughing, I wouldn't be so close to my friends. You can bond through laughter, sometimes it forces you to ask questions and get to know people in other ways than you would. It makes you feel comfortable around people and allows you to share things and act silly without worrying about your appearance. Laughter can also change your emotion from crazy to happy in one case. For example, I was riding off-road motorbikes with my young cousin and he decided he wanted to cross this swamp with his bike. I told him it was not very wise because I knew that it was not possible for him to go through it without getting stuck and yet he tried it anyway. So, since I assumed he had stuck the bike and since I was the only one with him, I had to help him take the bike off. It took us forever to get the bike out. As soon as we did he tried to cross again and got stuck another time. I was very angry with my cousin but as I was about to scream and leave him he fell head first in the mud and it instantly changed my mood. Even today, I laugh about it even though I didn't think it was very funny back then. Even though laughter is good, it can also be bad; @ CAPS1 mocking others when they are hurt and cry, or mock stupid ignorant pranks, or even mock people when they make bad decisions. Decisions @ CAPS1 drink, drunk people are funny, but being drunk or drinking at all is not. You can actually influence people to make bad decisions by making fun of them. Making fun of them makes them think it's @ CAPS2 to do what they're doing because it makes other people laugh. Laughter is therefore healthy, but it is also unhealthy in a way.

So my friends and I had a heated discussion about how we should keep things to ourselves because a friend of mine told people personal things about us. He caused us a lot of trouble in school and in the city, @ CAPS1 he started lying to us, one of my other friends lost him and chased him and tackled him telling him to lie enough . The moment he let him get up and we all got back into the seats he started telling us his guts, he told us that some rumors he started about us and other things that he had done, we all lost him a bit. So we calmed down a bit then we took turns talking to him, after my two friends had spoken, it was my turn to talk to him and he kept interrupting me, finally I got into anger and I grabbed something on the floor to throw at him. Don't do me wrong for not hurting myself to prevent him from interrupting me. I bent down, grabbed something soft without looking, picked it up and threatened to throw it at him and he started pointing and laughing, I stopped turning my head to see what I had in my hand. Now remember it was an intense conversation, you could cut the tension with a nife, just for him to laugh and everyone to join in, I didn't want to know. But I turned my head, looked and fell down laughing, it was a plush fairy that I picked up from his floor, I made it through him, but in a playful way. We all finally stopped laughing and sat down. I think that calmed us down enough to explain and improve things for him and for all of us. the moral of the story is that even if your crazy something will always make you smile and make your day better.

 Every fiber of my being prompted me to talk to him, but my instincts swelled with anxiety every time I mustered the courage to do @ CAPS6. Then she glanced at me. Just a second, but enough to gather information on me. Enough to say that I wasn't just looking around the room, but focused on her dark brown eyes, and hers only. I looked away sheepishly, promptly advising me, why did you keep looking at her? You knew she was going to notice it! But somehow I knew I wanted her to do it. I wanted her to look at me. I couldn't feel his gaze on me anymore, even though it was only a second before our eye contact. I darted my eyes in her direction again. This time she was looking at me first and I fell in her line of sight. I didn't know what to do about it, I've never been in this situation before. @ CAPS5 girl already beat me at first glance. She smiled, a cute little smile, I noticed you noticed me, I don't see why you should hide it. I have my eye on you. All I could do was focus so I didn't look like a jerk. I tried to smile, but only slightly, enough to let her know I had seen her smile, and it was towards me! There was @ PERSON1, who was smiling at me, giving me a chance to show her what makes me a guy for her. Then @ DATE1 came. @ LOCATION1's ice rink was about @ NUM1 minutes away, which seemed short because of @ NUM2's friends yelling and chatting shit behind their backs. We arrived and parked next to the ice rink. As we got out of my mom's van, we could all hear the commotion of the kids putting on their rental skates and awkwardly walking towards the thick glass doors that lead to the oval arena of dry freezing air accompanied by a thick bed of cut ice. Our group of friends all exchanged our money and received our own pair of worn out ice skates, probably never cleaned. Absently, we slip on the uncomfortable slatted shoes and waddle towards the glass doors. One by one, each of us carefully walked the ice, making sure we didn't look silly as we glided forward and did the lunges in front of everyone around us. When we finally took on this challenge, we continued to slide with the current of skaters flowing counterclockwise around the rink. Every once in a while we would race against each other for a lap, but on top of that we just talked about @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2: @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 and various other games we're interested in. But as usual, that conversation turned into a debate about “ supercharged classes ”. One side complaining that they can never win against this class, the other saying that it is very easy to "destroy" them with a simple turn. I started to get dizzy out of the fight, looking around the rink, watching people stumble along their way or glide gracefully through the awkward skating participants. Then I saw her again. Her hair was the first thing that caught my eye, it served as a blanket to hang from a clothesline in the breeze of a @ DATE2. Then, as she circled the end of the rink, her face began to reveal itself, just as beautiful as before. She didn't have the hardest time skating, but every now and then she slipped a skate too far to one side, lost her balance, but was able to regain her composure in a second or two. I smiled as she looked around, checking to see if anyone had seen her little mishap. “@ CAPS5 the sniper is @ CAPS6 @ LOCATION2 you don't know what you're talking about!” My friends laughed at each other. I had @ CAPS5 in my interest to be involved in this argument. As I walked away from my friends and made my way through the crowds, I made my way to @ PERSON2. As I approached her, I ran lines through my head to use as an icebreaker with her. I noticed her feet were sliding outward on both sides of her, and I smiled at what I could do to be able to engage her. As she started to stumble, I had to perfectly time my driveway to look like a random passerby right there to help her back up, rather than an anxious boy trying to find a way to speak to her. Just as she was about to fall, I accelerated and placed my hand on her back and gave her a little push upward. But she had gone too far. She fell on top of me as we fell on the hard ice. As the commotion set in, she quickly jumped up and apologized for her awkwardness. But all she noticed was my hysterical laughter. All she could do was laugh.

                  Laughs I have a lot of friends. My friends and I always do silly things to have a good time and pass the time. We laugh all the time. There isn't a day we're together and we don't laugh. My friends and I believe that laughter is an essential part of life. One day, blazing, @ DATE1 my friends, @ PERSON2, @ LOCATION3, @ PERSON1, @ LOCATION1 and @ PERSON3, all came to my house. We were all bored and hot so we wanted to decide on something exciting to do. @ LOCATION3 said: "@ CAPS1 aren't we going swimming at your place?" We all agreed. My friends and I couldn't agree on where to go for a swim. We couldn't go to the swimming pool near my house because it was too crowded. We also couldn't go to the lake because it was too far away and we had no way to get there. My mother was working, so she couldn't drive us. @ CAPS6 then said, "I know you guys! @ CAPS1 aren't we just having a water balloon fight here at @ CAPS2's house?" We all replied : "@ CAPS3, let's go !" Shortly after, the @ CAPS4 went to the nearest store, which was @ ORGANIZATION1, to purchase water balloons, and water guns. Once back they started filling them right away. While we ladies put on our swimsuits. After that, we all decided who was going to be on which team. The first team was @ PERSON2, @ PERSON3 and @ LOCATION1. The second and best team was @ LOCATION3, @ PERSON1 and me. The two teams were all ready to go. Each team had buckets full of water balloons and water guns. The teams were from different sides of my mother's green suburb. We were going to start throwing water balloons at number three, but the opposing team cheated and threw a water balloon forward. Oh, but they didn't realize we had the hose on our side. @ PERSON4 chased @ PERSON1 across the yard. She caught up with her and drenched her with her water pistol, but @ PERSON1 threw a huge water balloon at her. It exploded directly in his face. We all started to laugh. Then @ PERSON2 and I started tossing water balloons at each other. We ran out, so we started using our water guns. These also ended up missing. @ PERSON2 was running out of resources. I grabbed the hose and put it on full power. @ PERSON2 tried to run but slipped and fell. I watered it completely. My team won the first @ CAPS5. It was time for @ CAPS5 two now. We had filled more water balloons, filled our water guns, and went to our side. We all counted: “One! Of them ! Three ! @ CAPS5 two had started. @ LOCATION3 has started chasing @ PERSON3. They circled the suburbs at least five times before he caught up with her. He caught up with her on the grass. The grass was really slippery since I wet @ CAPS6 so they slipped and fell. @ PERSON3 slipped first, but took @ LOCATION3 with her when she tried to get up. We all started throwing water balloons at them, which kept them from getting up. @ PERSON3 managed to get up, she went to the side where her team was. They started throwing everything they had at us. They absorbed us. We had lost the second @ CAPS5. It was now time for the final @ CAPS5. The @ CAPS5 who decided who won and who lost. We have double the water balloons and double the water guns. No one got the tip this time. We thought it wasn't fair. The two teams lined up on different sides of my front yard. My team was on the right side and the opposing team was on the left side. We were against those who were lined up in front of us. I threw the first water balloon at @ LOCATION1. Then @ LOCATION3 started @ PERSON2, and after @ PERSON3 to @ LOCATION2. Who has never moved from the lost line. @ PERSON1 was the first to lose. @ PERSON3 threw a big water balloon at him which knocked him off the line. We have gone one step further. It was now three against two. @ LOCATION3 then the water sprayed @ CAPS6 downwards. We have gone one step further. @ PERSON4 and I were going back and forth, but @ PERSON4 ran out of water balloons after a while and her water gun was empty, so I beat her. We have gone one step further. @ LOCATION3, and I easily soaked @ PERSON3. My team had won! We all clapped, then went back inside to dry off and have an ice cream to celebrate the success of my teams. That day we proved that anyone can have a great time with great friends, imagination and lots of laughs. I believe everyone should laugh regularly. There is no need for sadness or anger in life.

 Well it all started the day he got to the airport. I hardly ever miss being able to see him or having him return your phone calls like a brother @ CAPS2 but it's always a blessing to see him and have him for the holidays it's amazing how he found it time during the @ DATE1 to come and visit us. it was very lucky because now I didn't have to hear her cry all the time because it was too cold and humid in here. So that was pretty good, but because it was the @ DATE1 it was normally the time I go out and hang out with my friends and daughters and now I started talking to this really beautiful girl who live just around the corner from my house i was dying to go out and be with her but as time was really short with him i had to put my brother @ CAPS2 first. she was so beautiful, so funny, she was perfect for me, it was crazy as a dream. I talked to my brother about her all the time. He always told me that even though she was real, it was impossible for a girl to be like that. It was the first day he spent the night, everyone was so happy in the house from the moment we came in from the airport until we came home talking jokingly that 'he had changed the way his clothes were tight. It was good, we even stopped at Burger-vile for a few burgers because the fat boy was so hungry all the time nonstop. We quickly got home and the look on my little brother and sisters face was priceless there with their mouths so wide open as if they were just seeing God. As they ran towards he wasn't as prepared for this he slowly put his bags down by the door he got dumped and ruined by a @ NUM1 year old girl and @ NUM2 year old boy, it was funny to see them so happy and excited it was a surprise to them we were only supposed to get gas ha ha ha. Then we sat and talked all night when we rented movies earlier in the day to watch them, as a family, but like my family nothing ever happens as a result or on time. You know when you are having fun and laughing you don't want it to end and forget everything, just let the time pass and keep doing what you are doing. But as time catches up with you, your ad runs on low power because you've been excited all day to see your brother @ CAPS2 and share stories, tell jokes and laugh while having fun, you are sleepy and you really need to rest like sleeping your bed in the covers and with the lights off, in silence. Oh good times having sweet dreams of food and girls. Most of the time he gathers in one hole dream after dream ha ha ha. Then we woke up and had a great time sharing laughs in the morning while making a nonstop joke. Speaking of hanging out I had to take my brother @ CAPS2 to one of my parties which really scared my parents but it was funny at the same time because before I left my mom was like d 'okay we let you out don't get into any shit @ CAPS1 not doing well your dads are going to come get you so don't act stupid take care of your brother okay and right after i said yeah, okay i bet. I questioned it and it was like what? why should I take care of my brother @ CAPS2, he should take care of me. but I guess that's what made him funny. since then we've had a great time and that's where this story ends with me saying goodbye to him at the airport. hoping that one day soon I will see him again soon.

 My Laughter Story @ CAPS1 do you know that laughing really adds time to your life? Well, you do it now. Laughter is a good thing to have, because without laughter our world would be boring and useless. On a daily basis, you should laugh every day. Laughing can really get you through a tough time. Me, @ PERSON3, @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON4 were hanging out just one day at @ ORGANIZATION4 and @ PERSON4 was really funny, we were all laughing hysterically at what @ was saying PERSON4, then suddenly @ PERSON2 calls us and wants to go out and we come to @ LOCATION1, but she said only @ NUM1 of us can go. So we all debated who was going to go. We made a decision and @ PERSON4 was the one to stay behind, but @ PERSON1 gave him something to keep him occupied. So @ PERSON1, @ PERSON3 and I were harassing the bus to @ LOCATION1 @ LOCATION1. There was a tweaker on the bus and he made us laugh so much, but he didn't even try. So we arrived at @ ORGANIZATION1. We were all hungry so we decided to buy some @ ORGANIZATION2. When we got to @ ORGANIZATION2 we all got a dollar burger that were scams so we all kept our pickles that were on the burger so when we left we could stick them on the windows. We @ CAPS1 and it made us laugh so hard we could run away. When we got to @ ORGANIZATION3's apartment, we knocked on their door, no one answered, so we knocked again, no response. We were about to call her when she came out of another apartment and we all started laughing because we knocked on someone else's door. When we walked in there was a party so we were nice. When we got there we all had a few beers. We were having such a great time we were all laughing and having a great time. The next morning we woke up to @ NUM2 am because we had to take the bus back to @ LOCATION2 early as it was @ DATE1 and the buses only run for a little while. When we got on the bus the bus driver was making faces like he was constipated or something, but he made me laugh a lot. When we got back to @ LOCATION2 we called @ PERSON4 to see what he was doing he was just hanging out in town so we went and hit him with him for the rest of the day and later we all got home at home. It was a good weekend.

 laughter is the best medicine, well that's what some say. I think laughter is good for you and if you are in a relationship, laughing is really good for that. @ CAPS1 here are some of the ways laughing is good for you. Laughing in a relationship is good because if you can't laugh together, you probably won't be together. If you can't laugh with your boyfriend / girlfriend, you won't have a great relationship with him / her. @ CAPS1 don't be afraid to laugh a little with your boyfriend or your girlfriend. I think and think most people will say the same thing that if you want a good relationship you have to laugh. Laughing is good when you are sad because you can be told a joke and if it is a good joke it can make you feel better. It works in school for you to laugh with your friends and all your stress will be gone. we will all get along better and not argue at school, @ CAPS1 wouldn't have many people in jail or in person, @ CAPS1 that's why I think laughter is the best medicine for sad people, stressed and in a relationship. But you think what you want, but that's what I think is good to laugh about.

 Have you ever laughed so hard that you started to cry? Were you alone Most of the time, when you laugh at something, you are with someone else. I believe laughter brings two people together because it's something that both of you share, a time that you and that other person can think about and imagine over and over again in the future. Even if this person is miles away. I remember it like it happened a few weeks ago. I had just finished a conversation with @ CAPS3 mom. I went to room @ CAPS3 and unplugged the little black phone @ CAPS3 from the charger. I opened it and a blinking light flashed saying "@ NUM1 missed calls from @ PERSON1". I called her back to apologize for missing her phone call. I heard someone pick up the phone, but no one was speaking on the other end of the phone. "@ CAPS1, @ PERSON1 are you there?" I asked, hoping to get an answer from him. Of course, I got an answer that wasn't the one I wanted. She started to scream. Trying to catch his breath, the words barely escaping his mouth. "@ CAPS2, @ CAPS3 grandfather just died." @ CAPS3's heart sank into @ CAPS3's stomach. @ CAPS3's eyes started to get wet and @ CAPS3's throat started to close, making it harder to breathe. @ CAPS3's voice was all shaky and rough. I said, "I'm sorry @ PERSON1." and I started to cry. We both weren't helping anytime soon. She then explained to me that he had had a heart attack and asked me how something could happen to someone who did not deserve it. I had no answer for him, however. I had never been in the position she was in. Who was I to know what to say or do to help her? So I thought about what to say to him to clear his mind a little. @ CAPS3's brain started to ache when I finally found something from my heart to tell him, something that I would like to hear if @ CAPS3's grandfather passed away. I said in a low, soothing voice, “I can't tell you much because I don't know from experience, but your family needs you right now as much as you need them. good times you had. with your grandpa @ CAPS4. The laughs you enjoyed together. I heard a small laugh under her snort. She started telling me a story about how her family every year was going for a weekend to the beach. How it was a time for her family to bond and how much she would miss it. When she told me this story @ CAPS3 the heart warmed and the corners of @ CAPS3's mouth lifted a little. I was proud of myself for staying in there and being strong for @ CAPS3's friend. Even though @ PERSON1 will never see his grand- father @ CAPS4, she will always have him with her, through memories, with in her heart and through laughter.

 Laughter is one of the most amazing things the human body can do. The sound of laughter is as unique as the sound of crying. There are a lot of things that can make people laugh. And once you start laughing, you can't stop. Laughter is caused by something that is humorous, so it is mainly the cause of the laughter that makes it so much more fun. And it usually depends on who you are with, where you are and what situation you find yourself in before you can actually start laughing. Kind of like when I was at @ LOCATION2 baking a pie with my @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 ..... It was a nice warm evening at @ LOCATION2, and I was baking a pie with my @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. We had all the ingredients we needed to bake the pie until my @ CAPS1 told me that the sugar was gone. She tells me to get on the covers and grab a jar of sugar. So I went, and there were two jars when I opened the lids, I asked him which of the two jars was the sugar because they had no labels on it. “I think it's the pot on the left,” she said. I grab the pot on the left side without another word. Later, while everyone was sitting chatting, my @ CAPS1 and I went to get the pie to serve to the family. They all stared at the pie in wonder as we pulled it out and started slicing it. After everyone had been served they all had a bite to eat. Immediately, within seconds, everyone starts spitting it out like it's the worst thing they've ever put in their mouth. ” Suddenly my @ LOCATION1 makes a comment saying the pie is too salty ... not exactly the kind of comment I expected. Then my @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 will check to see the pot that I had grabbed from the blankets. She puts her finger in the jar and tastes it. Fortunately, it was the salt pot. Then, out of nowhere, everyone laughs to tears at the thought of what just happened. It was the most fun I had that night, no one could stop laughing. Obviously, the situation with the pie was something I will surely never forget, and it probably will never happen again. And after everything that happened with the pie ended up being the kind of situation that made you laugh. This shows that the three causes of laughter are real. First, I was with my @ CAPS1. Second, I was in my @ LOCATION1's house where there must be at least one funny thing going on there. And also what happened with the salt and sugar was a completely unexpected situation that turned out to be unmistakably hilarious. And to think that this event happened because of the three main causes of laughter. Laughter is one of the most amazing things the human body can do. Laughter will always be one of those things in life that can never be destroyed. If you are a person who says they never laughed, then you are a liar and a hypocrite. Being able to laugh is good for you and your health. It gives you extra oxygen in your lungs to help you breathe better and it's great fun. So if you ever notice that you haven't laughed, stop immediately and take the time to laugh.

 Laughter - as we all know @ CAPS4 - is a visual expression of happiness, or an inner feeling of joy. @ CAPS4 @ MONTH1 makes sure to tell a joke, get tickled or any other random stimuli. @ CAPS4 is in most cases a very pleasant feeling. Thus, laughter has a huge impact on all of us throughout our daily life. Laughter tends to light up our emotions by expressing them in many good, joyful and finally positive ways. However, @ CAPS4 has been proven that laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle or sneeze. When laughter is shared, @ CAPS4 binds people together and increases intimacy and happiness. Around @ TIME1 - which happens to be exactly at the start of my third period class, I was supposed to be in my @ CAPS1 class at the time, but hopefully - I wasn't. You're probably thinking, "@ CAPS2, if she's not in her third period class, then where is she ?" I actually ended up in the computer lab, starting my report writing test again. I certainly wasn't very excited about taking the writing test again, but in my heart I knew deep down that I could take the state writing test this time without any ifs, and , or but, which are also known as the worst things ever - excuses. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that I was going to walk out of the room, realizing that I could have done better - that's for sure. My self-confidence was set at an extremely high level, with no negative thoughts to think about. I was ready to face the test - once again. As soon as I entered the computer lab, I almost sat up as fast as a fly trying to dodge a fly swatter. I took a huge, deep breath, as usual, and started to log into the computer. In the meantime I was waiting for my computer to plug in, I just sat there looking around the room, doing nothing more, and then visualizing what I was going to type my state writing test on. Once the teacher approved my connection, I started typing all of my personal information into the empty boxes, so that I could begin my next steps. In seconds, I was ready to start my test. On the screen appeared several topics listed below to choose from, but there was only one that I felt most satisfied with and felt I could score extremely high. . The topic was, "We all understand the benefits of laughing. For example, someone said," Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. “A lot of other people think that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Tell a true story in which laughter was about an item or a part.” At the time I picked this topic, I didn't have it. honestly no idea what I was going to write because during my childhood I had a lot of laughs, and almost every story I could remember had to be more than @ NUM1 words. So I just set there quietly thinking - how good I knew I would be. During the moment, I heard this very irritating sound, which came from the many tapping of the child's keyboards and the many annoying clicks of the computer mice. @ CAPS4 was very evident that the students understood their subject fairly @ CAPS2 - unlike me. The minutes had passed so quickly, and yet still nothing. Not a single story to share about laughter. At that point, I was very angry with myself, because if you really think of @ CAPS4, who doesn't have a story to write about laughter ? I knew I had some kind of story to share, @ CAPS4 was just harder for me to summarize one and type in about @ CAPS4. Just then, as I was about to start my essay, a young student (who had taken a state reading test) shouted out loud, "@ CAPS3!" The little kid didn't just grab myself but the rest of the class as @ CAPS2. Honestly, I swear @ CAPS4 was a "had to be there time". @ CAPS4 wasn't just because he said @ CAPS3 extremely loud, but the expression that was on his face and the way he announced @ CAPS4 to everyone in the computer lab - @ CAPS4 almost killed me inside. The little boy was so delighted and proud of himself that he had passed away. Obviously he was very keen to let the whole class know - which I probably would have done as @ CAPS2. Almost as quickly as he announced @ CAPS4 I knew it was a laughing moment not only to remember but to share with others as @ CAPS2. In fact, truth be told, this news turned out not only to make my day, but it had made my writing assessment subject much less stressful for me. As you can see, laughter indeed seems to have a huge impact on all of us throughout our daily lives, and sometimes those moments are meant to be shared.

 For me, there are so many times in my life that involve laughter. Having fun and laughing are the main things I do in my life. When I laugh I feel happy so whenever I'm sad or angry people can always tell a joke or something to make me laugh and I'm happy again. I like to make people laugh. Sometimes when I try to make people laugh I tell a joke but I'm not that funny. When I'm just myself, people laugh. I guess I can be funny without even trying. I have amazing friends i mean absolutely amazing even though we have our tough days i still love them and thank @ CAPS1 for them everyday. My friends and I are always planning a way to have fun, and whenever we find something to do @ CAPS2 always turns out to be fun. Even the little things, like facial expressions, the way we pronounce a word, or even the way we eat our food make us laugh. @ CAPS2 is actually pretty ridiculous. When my friends and I try to tell others about our hilariously hilarious adventures, they all stare at us as we laugh out loud. @ CAPS2 people might not think @ CAPS2 is funny because they weren't there. This year my family has an exchange student named @ PERSON1. She is from @ LOCATION2. She is very shy and calm. @ PERSON1 never seemed to make me laugh, @ CAPS5 boy was I wrong. She might be the funniest thing to browse @ LOCATION4. I think she's funny, anyway. Sometimes she is so oblivious that @ CAPS2 is just hard not to laugh at her. I have a best friend named @ PERSON2. We have so many fun memories together. She is amazing and funny. She's so small, people call her a dwarf, she quickly responds, "I'm not a dwarf!" I'm @ NUM1 '@ NUM2' ', you have to be @ NUM1' @ NUM4 '' to be a dwarf! " @ CAPS2 is so cute when she does that. I recently returned from living with my grandparents at @ LOCATION1. While I was living there I was informed (over the phone I might add) that there had a daughter living in my old room. "@ CAPS2 is an overseas student from @ LOCATION2" my family told me. I returned to @ LOCATION3 for @ CAPS4 with my family. When I got here I got met @ PERSON1. She seemed so calm and sweet. @ CAPS2 was late when we got home, so I immediately fell asleep. The next day I woke up, called my grandma, then I called @ PERSON2 and asked her to come spend time with me. She came and met @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 told us she wanted to give my mom a birthday present and I replied: “@ CAPS5, it's tomorrow, let's go to town.” The three of us went to town and went to @ ORGANIZATION1 for @ CAPS6. When we were ar riveted there we all searched for something we thought she might like. Somehow we ended up in the underwear aisle. @ PERSON2 picked out a small pair of underwear and shouted, "@ CAPS7 @ PERSON1, what about these ?" @ PERSON1 looked at her with the funniest facial expression and yelled back, "@ CAPS8, I don't think my thighs would go through this!" @ PERSON2 and I literally fell to the floor and laughed so hard our faces were bright red. Based on our first impression, we thought she was a quiet, "kept to herself" girl, so we just thought @ CAPS2 was hilarious. We tease @ PERSON1 about this quite often and she teases us about other fun things that we have encountered. I have grown to love @ PERSON1 and I love being with her and making fun of any situation.

 As the hot @ DATE1 days turned into cold winter nights, the girls (@ PERSON3, @ PERSON5, @ PERSON2, @ CAPS1 and @ PERSON4) and I were wondering what we should do to add some spice. to our life. No one knew what was going to happen or the laughter we were going to experience. It was one of the biggest games of the season @ ORGANIZATION1. It was a question of whether or not they were going to the playoffs to compete for @ CAPS2. @ CAPS1 is the biggest fan of @ ORGANIZATION1 known to man. She was rude, all dressed up in the @ CAPS3 outfit. We watched the game, had a few shots of apple juice, and enjoyed @ ORGANIZATION2. Halftime was just around the corner and to say the least, the halftime show wasn't going to be all that and a bag of crisps. I took my camera out of my bag looking like @ PERSON1 and hit save. As I walked around in circles trying to get everyone in the video @ PERSON3 was having a little too much fun on a red exercise ball. She was bouncing up and down at least @ NUM1 or three inches in the @ CAPS7. A light bulb went on in my head. I handed the camera over to @ PERSON4 and slowly moved to where @ PERSON3 was bouncing. Just as @ PERSON3 shouted, "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7!" I pulled the exercise ball out from under her and when she came back down she was straight on her back! @ PERSON3 was too busy laughing and trying to breathe to tell @ CAPS5 how stupid I was. I was on the floor curled up trying really hard not to pee in my pants when suddenly I hear that banging sound. I look up and the camera was lying on the floor next to @ PERSON4, @ PERSON5 and @ PERSON2 who were laughing with @ CAPS5. @ PERSON3 has finally had the strength to stand up. She came over and hit @ CAPS5 on the head and said, "@ CAPS8 never do that again." I would say we had a better halftime show than @ ORGANIZATION1 did. At the end of the game the weather changed and it started to snow. As everyone rushed to find their shoes, bumping into each other, I grabbed the camera without worrying if I was getting sick or not. We spent the last hour doing two of my favorite things; take photos and create memories. We got inside and slowly fell asleep after drinking a little too much hot chocolate and apple juice. @ PERSON3 has always been an early bird. I felt this sharp pain in my back and pulled straight out. Only to quickly realize that it was only his fist. Soon after, everyone rose from their warm blankets. Everyone @ CAPS9 @ CAPS1. We let her sleep and wondered outside again. It snowed. A @ CAPS11. We came up with a plan and started collecting all the snow into one giant pile. @ CAPS1 is a heavy sleeper, so we picked her up, opened the door to the backyard, and dropped her in the center of the stack. @ CAPS1's eyes went wide and wide. His mouth followed doing the same. She used every swear word she could think of, including some in @ CAPS12 that even she didn't know the meaning of. Soon we were all in the snow laughing so hard we couldn't even @ CAPS6 our breaths to apologize. @ CAPS1 realized this was an exceptionally good joke and started laughing with the rest of us. In the end, we all had a good laugh and a cold to share that night. Laughter is the most important element in any relationship. It strengthens the bond between you and others. Whoever said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people," was right @ PERCENT1.

There are a lot of times when laughter was the biggest part of our friendship. But @ CAPS3 doesn't know if we just think it was funny or if people think it was funny. My two best @ CAPS2 are @ LOCATION2 and @ PERSON2. I've known them both since we were little. It was pretty much in second year when we became @ CAPS2. Although we were never really close until about sixth grade. These days @ closest CAPS3 @ CAPS1 @ LOCATION2, so I'm at @ LOCATION1. I remember when @ LOCATION2 and I tossed little pieces of eraser across the room, almost missing our teacher. Perhaps the first memory I remember @ CAPS1 @ PERSON2 was when we were in third grade. We'd be fooling around and messing around at @ LOCATION3. The three of us haven't hung out much since starting high school. It also doesn't help when we each go to different schools. But when @ LOCATION2, @ PERSON2 and I would always come out laughing and having a good time. One example of laughter that brought us together is when we went to skate park @ PERSON1 for my birthday a few years ago. @ PERSON2's grandmother took us there and on the way we asked if we could stop and pick up @ ORGANIZATION1. I just got a @ CAPS4 camera for my birthday, so I decided to bring it. We went to @ ORGANIZATION1 located on @ NUM1 street. As we were driving through the drive-thru and @ PERSON2's grandmother was ordering. @ PERSON2 decided to roll down his window and started ordering things for himself at the same time as his grandmother. He asked for an @ ORGANIZATION2 and a big fry. What made it really funny was that his grandmother was going crazy. She told @ PERSON2 to stop and told the person on the microphone not to listen to the male voice in the background. But @ PERSON2 kept doing it anyway. When we approached the window to get the food, @ PERSON2 told his grandmother to stop far enough away so that he could take the food. As we pulled up, @ PERSON2 rolled down her window and picked up the food. @ CAPS3 so glad I brought my camera and recorded it all. When we got there we jumped out of the car and drove to the park. It was later that day when we got there, probably around three or four. At first, neither of us really skated because we were looking around. But when we started skating, we were there for about four or five hours. Because when we left it was dark outside. There are four sets of stairs, the two stairs, the three legs, the three blocks and the five stairs. This is the order in which they go in size and how difficult it is to @ PERSON3. Because we had been there for so long that we recorded a lot of videos. Some of us were skating, some were really random and fun, and then some of us, I don't know what was going on in them. Later that day, when we were tired and bored of being there, @ PERSON2's grandmother picked us up. They both came to my house when we got back. We just watched @ CAPS5 and played some video games. It's always funny to see one of us get frustrated because they don't win. Finally, we stopped and listened to some music. Towards @ NUM2 pm @ PERSON2 went home and @ LOCATION2 stayed on @ TIME1. While we were in my living room he was playing with @ CAPS1 the tripod I got @ CAPS1 my camera. As he has it in his hands, he unscrews it and it crumbles. We both laughed at first, but then I got mad because I just figured it out. It was a really fun day, full of laughter, dedication to skating and our friendship. It was a day when I felt closer to @ LOCATION2 and @ PERSON2.

                            Laugh @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 your little one, that's exactly it, little one. You look at everyone with no idea @ CAPS6 to do anything. Now, it's usually @ CAPS1 that your parents do. They feed you, love you and take care of you, but @ CAPS4 most of all, they teach you what you need to know. Growing up, I learned that you should help others, not just yourself. One way that I find easy for me to help others is to laugh. Laughter is not something that only affects the people around you, @ CAPS2 affects you as well. You can ask anyone if someone has ever made a difference in their life by making them laugh. Or could have made a difference by making them laugh. @ CAPS4 will be able to think of a time when this happened, some @ MONTH1 not. Even though I know for a fact, someone made a difference in my life just by making me laugh. For example, I remember one day @ CAPS1 when I felt so lonely and forgotten. I felt used, even betrayed. Growing up, I knew my friends as a second family. They have always been there for me. Although like the kids of @ CAPS4 we had a fight, but by the end of the day everything was back to normal. People say, "@ CAPS6 come on I never noticed @ CAPS6 easy I had @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 I was little? I thought I had @ CAPS2 bad then?" @ CAPS7 @ CAPS2 doesn't matter @ CAPS6 problems change anyway. @ CAPS2 always hurts to fight with friends. There are still days when you feel horribly lonely, but you're not sure why. One of those days when the smallest thing seems to cut the deepest. This day was one of those kinds of days. Now see, I was young then; I was only in third grade and my best friend was a girl named @ PERSON1. I don't remember exactly what we fought for, but I do remember @ CAPS6 if I felt it. I remember walking around the classroom, on the verge of tears at that point. I had dealt with @ PERSON1 so cruel before, but everything she said that day had really hurt me. I was always first in class, not sure @ CAPS6 exactly I was, but always have been. In my seat, I sat down and didn't move. My brain had taken me to my own little world of grief. It's @ CAPS1 she asked me what was wrong. Even as a child, I hated @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 people I didn't really know asked me if I was okay. @ CAPS2 embarrassed me, because @ CAPS2 was just another reminder that I was showing weakness to people who probably didn't care. Although this time @ CAPS2 is different, and in a strange way, @ CAPS2 has helped. I explained to my teacher what had happened in a rush of tears and details. What really made the difference was that after all my teacher tried to comfort me and make me feel better, she made me laugh. Whatever I told her exactly, her response not only made me feel better, but made me realize that @ CAPS2 wasn't that bad. I laughed for a while to myself, and by the time everyone was in the class, I was happy. At the end of the day, @ PERSON1 and I were best friends again. My teacher honestly did me a favor. As a child, you are vulnerable. You don't see the world as a hard and unforgivable place. This is why people turn out the way they do. It's all about the environment in which they grew up. I think I was changed by this little effort. This little joke made me realize that everything was going to get better in the long run. Laughter has been important to me ever since. I helped me realize the effect you have on people. Even at a young age, you can still tell the difference. Since then, I have used what my teacher taught me. I've learned that sometimes, even though you couldn't make them laugh, smile, or just be happy; the fact that you tried really made a difference. Laughter is important. @ CAPS2 changes people, regardless of their age.

 A big day for an adventure @ CAPS5 my sister invited me to her christion school called @ PERSON1, @ CAPS1 was a beautiful sunny day and then @ CAPS1 turned into a less sunny day. I woke up on the first day of my visit to my sister at her new school, went to all of her classes with her, the teachers were a bit hip and her friends too, after the second period of @ PERSON1 we went to her class @ CAPS2.E, said the teacher put on running shoes because we are going to run on a montian, my sister forgot to put on her running shoes so the teacher sent me and her to pick them up after that we got the shoes on the class was already a quarter mile away from school so my sister and i decided to take a short cut so we took the "seanic root" off road. We had come down a hill and @ CAPS1 was really steep my sister walked down halfway up the hill and slid on her butt the entire way after she left. life and I hit the sidewalk down I was like a weed in a hurricane my sister helped me up and we started running second class and they were "shocked" at what my sister and I looked like my sister looked like she had just finished playing in the mud me however it looked like I had been hit by a truck and my face was covered in dirt, @ CAPS3 after my sister and I got home , we decided to clean up, so we went to the showers the showers of @ PERSON1 are similar to those of @ CAPS4.HS but with shower curtains, the shower I had used the curtain had come off of this Medel hook and I was not smart and I was using a plastic stepladder, the floor was still wet from @ CAPS5 I had taken a shower and the stool slipped and my little finger caught on the hook and I sliced @CAP S1 open on a main vain in my little finger I started feeling dizzy and passed out my sister and her friends took me to my sister's room and put a bandage on @ CAPS1 @ CAPS5 I was still passed out. After I woke up I found myself between a blanket and a really uncomfortable bet that my sister was waiting for me to wake up and told me never to scare her like that, @ CAPS5 she said I to her said how i thought @ CAPS1 was funny @ CAPS5 we ran down the hill i didn't do much damage except to give myself a few scratches and how my pinky made me pass out.

  Every @ DATE1, my family, friends and I pack for an exciting trip to @ ORGANIZATION1. we always take our @ CAPS3 runner and sail with us. We are renting a large cabin which is right on the water's edge. We stay for about a week and it's always around 100 degrees, so we normally spend the majority of the day swimming in the water. It is located above the pass about an hour from @ CAPS1. There are many fun activities to do at @ ORGANIZATION1 like @ CAPS2, kayaking, water biking, biking, boating and more. It was the first year my brother had his boating license and I was so excited because it's so much more exciting to get him out of the tubes than my parents going really slow, and they don't give it back. very funny. He would always put one of us on the @ CAPS3 runner on the @ CAPS3 flag when one of us fell, and one of us was on the tube. He once took me with my friend @ PERSON1. It was late afternoon, and that's when the water gets choppy and choppy. First of all @ PERSON1 was in the tube and I was pointing at the back of the @ CAPS3 runner with my brother. It would have us going around in circles at around @ NUM1 mph. She ended up flying away right away. After @ PERSON1 got up on the @ CAPS3 runner, I jumped into the tube and told my brother I was ready. We would do the thumbs up to go faster, the thumbs down to slow down, and @ CAPS3 your arms around like you were mad to stop. He started to go and I had my thumbs up for a while waiting for him to go. It started to go very fast and I was flying around in circles. Every time I hit a @ CAPS3 I would get a whip flash. I put my thumb down to go slower and it didn't slow down, it just kept going faster and faster. Then I waved my arms to make him stop. @ PERSON1 was the one looking at me, and she thought it would be funny if she told my brother that I wanted to keep going faster. Finally, I did about two back flips in the water. I touched the water so fast I felt like my skin was going to fall off, it hurt so much. It took me about a minute to finally get to the top of the water when I took a huge breath of air. I was sitting in the water waiting for my brother to drive and pick me up. Something was wrong, I was out of my bikini bottoms. I started to panic and told my brother not to come. I looked for them all over the water, but they weren't visible. I told my brother about it and he called my dad. My mom and dad were about to bring me a pair of shorts because I was out of the water without shorts on. I had a blast at @ ORGANIZATION1 and have a great story that I will tell for the rest of my life. Can't wait to go back next year and know I'll bring super tight shorts to go tube.

  When you laugh, what do you think about? Who are you with? What are you doing ? When you were three years old you laughed because someone said "@ CAPS1-a-boo" and twisted their face. When you were thirteen you laughed because someone looked different and wasn't wearing "trendy" clothes. At twenty-three, you're laughing with your friends because your friend is drunk and doing something stupid in the middle of the party. But when you find yourself at thirty-three, you laugh while your husband wrestles with your five-year-old. Well, about three years ago my brother and I finally figured out how to have a relationship. The @ PERSON1 family has always been complicated. When we explain to people how we relate, their response is always, "@ CAPS2 ... What ? Start over !", So we try to avoid the topic. My brother @ PERSON2 has lived at @ LOCATION2 his entire life with his mom and step @ CAPS3, so neither our @ CAPS3 nor I really had a close relationship with him. Although not our fathers' fault, we only saw @ PERSON2 twice a year. During these twice a year @ PERSON2 and my sister @ PERSON3 always lashed out at me, hid from me and laughed at me because I couldn't do what they could. I hated it when he was coming down, because I knew I would spend most of my time crying and getting in trouble for things I hadn't done. When three children grow up together, they find they love each other better when they get along. My brother was not so mean to me anymore and he understood that we were on the same side against the common enemy: @ CAPS3. Our relationship has always grown around laughter, we get along because we are able to make jokes on each other every day and know that doesn't mean anything. It's our way of showing that we care for each other, sometimes we laugh at each other and sometimes we laugh at ourselves. Now that my brother is gone to college, we really miss each other and the key to our relationship is the laughter we share. When my brother found out he really loved me he taught me everything about video games and helped me out, we were not only on the same team in video game but also in real life . Summer @ DATE1 my brother and I were sitting at home bored because @ CAPS3 was at work and @ PERSON2 did not have a car at @ LOCATION1. We decided to play all the video games at least once throughout this long day. This challenge didn't last long as the first and last game we played that day was @ CAPS4 @ NUM1. We just started to figure out how it worked and where to go and we fought about it for a good hour. Then we started playing just to see who was winning the team, we started making jokes about other players and we gave all the bad players really weird names, we laughed the whole game. Then, to make things more interesting, we set out to create our own characters and create a fantastic draft. @ PERSON2 being a guy came up with the grossest names and made the players really scary or really funny he stacked their stats so they had an overall @ PERCENT1 squad average in everything. As a girl, I made all of my guys really sexy and muscular with funny names and only stacked their stats on what I thought was reasonable, based on how good they look, so my team average doesn't was that of @ PERCENT2. From the moment of the board to the moment we looked at the game's final stats, we laughed. Every time the announcer said the name of one of our players in this basketball context, it was so wrong but so funny, "@ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 for two". When both teams were shooting all the shots and by chance someone missed one, we would make so many comments and jokes. By the time @ CAPS3 got home he thought something was wrong because we were crying so much from laughing our beige carpet had turned brown. Even during dinner when we had calmed down, @ PERSON2 would say something that only I would know what it meant and we burst out laughing and @ CAPS3 was looking at us with a stunned expression. Looking back, I wouldn't trade anything for that day. Now @ PERSON2 and I sometimes think of that day when we start playing a sports game or just talk on the phone. We laugh and use the context to make fun of each other. You could say it's not a very normal relationship, but that's how we know we love each other, because the truth is, I don't even like video games, I don't play a game. video that when he wants it. So since that day we have come closer, we do not fight and we defend each other. So who ever said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between people. is right.

 It seems like every day of everyone's life they are tested in all their forms and it looks like it will never end. It gets stressful and complicated, but that's what makes us human. Something else that makes us human is laughter, but no matter how bad things go it can always be changed by a knock knock joke, a comedic ad or just a word from a best friend. I've been with my dad and a few of his high school buddies as they told stories about some of the crazy things they did when they were in high school. My dad and his friend @ CAPS1 got into a story about when they bought a @ NUM1 @ LOCATION1 storm for @ MONEY1. It turned out to be the biggest lesson in life and some of the funniest stories in my life. It was my father's second car he owned with @ NUM2 speed and @ NUM3 speed, anything was possible. It started when my dad first drove him to school, which didn't last long as an hour later. @ CAPS1 and my father left for a burnout on speed bumps in the school parking lot. This car was a burnt animal that backed up and then shifted to the side and it would all go up in smoke. My dad was sliding around some gravel bends one day and one of the skew pleat rear tires blew out, threw this car in the ditch and really messed up the side. Joe Enders pulled him out and half a gallon of glass dera a hammer and a paint bucket later he was ready to go. The next story I heard was when my dad's friend borrowed the car he needed something to get him to and from work. So my dad hands him the keys and says "keep him on the wheels @ NUM3". Two weeks later, one weekend, he was messing around and the car slipped off the road and rolled several times and buckled the roof. I never heard how he got out, but somehow he did and gave the car back to my dad. After that he had an organ transplant from a roof from a @ CAPS2 that hit a tree, @ NUM5 weeks later and he is ready to go again. Now it's just something about a rear wheel drive car and snow making us kids again. sliding in the snow was the last thing this car ever did. My dad and @ CAPS1 were driving in the snow having fun when the rear decided to swap places with the front. They lost control as they slid through the winter wonderland to a lonely telephone pole. The car slid into the post and that was the end of the fun. Eventually the car died and my dad drove the car home. He decided not to fix it and separated it, he sold the gear @ NUM3 for @ NUM7 @ MONEY1 the motor for @ NUM8 and the rear for @ NUM9 the trunk and hood weren't far for a other @ NUM9 the seat, steering column and radio that my father kept, the rest was junk. So all in all my dad has had some of the greatest times of his life for nothing more than gasoline money and a few spares. God bless @ LOCATION2 and I hope that one day I can have such memories soon.

I think laughter is a very important part of life and sometimes it helps people when they are there. Once I was with my cousin and she was having a bad day, she was stressed, upset and she didn't know what to do so she came and she got very emotional and I told her that there was no no harm crying, then after a while when she calmed down i told her life wasnt always going to be easy alot of people said life was life a chocolate box you gotta just eat @ NUM1 both some @ MONTH1 be sweet and others maybe not that good but i told her life is more like a jalapenos pot what u do now @ MONTH1 burn your butt tomorrow and she just laughed and at that point she smiled and laughed so i knew she would be fine she just needed time to calm down and be okay and after all she had a have a nice day she stayed on @ TIME1 and we just watched movies and listened to music and that's why i think It's good to laugh and on top of that you are losing calories that way ha-ha.

  Laughter is important The last two weeks of school, and I got the best news ever. My mom told me I was going to fly to @ LOCATION1, on my own. I was excited because I hadn't seen my family in a while. Even though @ CAPS1 flew many times, I was still scared, never flew alone, so this was going to be something extremely new. Even though I was both excited and scared, I kept thinking about seeing everyone in my family, and even meeting family members that I had never seen or heard before. School seemed to be going very slowly and I was very anxious. After two weeks, I had already packed my bags and was ready to go. My mom tried not to cry, but she did anyway. I walked throwing in the metal detectors and then down a long hallway, I finally got on the plane. During the plane ride, I thought I would meet my real dad, and that's all I thought about the entire time I was on the plane. I landed at @ LOCATION1 at @ NUM1 pm that day. I was happy too because I was tired. My sister picked me up from the airport. My sister and I didn't have a close relationship so it was a bit awkward. She started talking about the times we were younger and how we had fun. Ever since I was at @ LOCATION1 wanted to see a lot of my family, most of my family already knew I was in town, news travels fast. When my aunt saw me they were in shock, they said I had grown so much. I was so happy because it was one of the best times ever. I met so many people especially family friends it was amazing because I even met my mom's school friends. A few days later, I received a text from one of my sisters whom I had never seen or met before, and she was so happy to know that I was in town. She told me that she and my dad wanted to see me and hang out together, so we made plans. I was really nervous, because the only time I saw my dad was when I was very young. It was fifteen years ago. I really didn't know what I was going to do or say when I finally got to meet them, I was very scared, so I decided to take my sister and cousin along just so it wouldn't be awkward. We decided to meet at my grandmother's. I haven't seen her for a while, and unfortunately she wasn't there. When my father arrived there, I didn't know what to do, I didn't recognize him, nor even my other sister. We hugged each other. When we entered the house we were all silent and all my dad could say was "@ CAPS2" because I had grown so much. He then started talking about the little nonsense I did when I was little, and that made us all laugh. We just laughed and it made me cry a little. If it hadn't been for the laughter, my relationship with my father couldn't have been better.

So once my friends Chad, Justin and I gave up on this old man. the reason we did this was because we walked past his house every day and he was turning on his sprinkler and that annoying alarm. so at nine or ten in the evening, we walked over to his house, knocked on his door, and ran. it was so funny because when we got back from the race we went to our friend taylor's house and sat in the garage basking in the glory of what we had just accomplished. about ten seconds later we heard a knock on the garage door. at first we were a little surprised so we ran into the taylor hall, and that's when it happened ...! " and we burst out laughing. well he knew perfectly well that we were in there, so he went to the front door and started banging on it, waking up Taylor's mom. Well we ended up going out and talking to the guy and he said he had called the cops because he said it happened all the time, and we denied it was us, but it totally was, so we couldn't help but laugh at his horrible face. he looked like seriously to a cross turtle with an eighty year old rapist. he had liver spots on his face and a terrible gray jumpsuit that wasn't fooling anyone. by the time the cops arrived the guy was long gone and we had told the cop he was senile and didn't know what he was talking about. so we came out unharmed. that was it's funny and awesome.

 What exactly is laughter? Is it when something virtuous happens that makes a person happy? According to @ CAPS1 from @ PERSON1, laughter is a cause of cheerfulness. In other words, a fun and light spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but plays a big role in life itself. One example where laughter is important in relationships is when a very good friend of mine stopped talking to me about that blind feud we had over an instinct to become an animal. It had been almost two years exactly, that she and I had not spoken to each other. I thought nothing would bring us together, until one day I was at the store and we crossed paths. We just looked at each other and started to laugh. Immediately, and there, we understood that the argument we had was useless and that it was not worth talking about. To be clearer with this story, is that without laughing, my friend and I would never have been reunited. When you meet new people, what's the first thing you tend to do to get them to like you ? You usually tell jokes or say something funny just to make one or two laugh. This is where laughter relates to life, to the physical and mental experiences that make up an individual's existence. When you meet a new person, you often find that these people have at least one thing in common. I guarantee you that in every friendship, laughter is the most common thing people share together. There is no possible way to get around it. Another example of how important laughter is in life is when someone is looking for a job or showing up for a job interview and whoever is responsible for making the decision whether or not to get the job has not. of personality. What do you do most often in this type of situation, either show your serious side or possibly make a few jokes. If that doesn't work out well, at least that person has a good idea of who you are. Learning to manage life can become very stressful, but also trying to manage it mentally can be quite a challenge. A friend of mine had just graduated from college and was having trouble finding a job she was studying at. She was very stressed and also very depressed because her grandmother was in the hospital and ready to die. @ CAPS3 didn't know what to do, no money was coming in yet and she couldn't find an apartment, she was just a mess. Until one day she told me that she had re-issued a call from her sister and her sister mentioned that their grandmother couldn't hold and that she was ready to move on. @ CAPS3 rushed to the hospital and went to see her grandmother's last before she passed away. Her grandmother grabbed her hand and said, "I know life can be bad and doesn't give you a chance, but you have to go through this and enjoy life. Life is too short to worry. what tomorrow has in store. Just put that smile on your face and laugh when life gives you the worst. " @ CAPS2 and there @ CAPS3 realized that what her grandmother had said was true. You can't live life hanging around, just get up and take it. @ CAPS3 was very devastated by the loss of her grandmother, but @ CAPS2 once again she felt that this was meant to happen because without her grandmother had told her about it, she would never have known that her grand- mother had gone through the same thing as her. She didn't feel like she was the only one in the world going through this difficult crisis. She will always love her grandmother. When you learn to take life as it is, people tend to notice that this is indeed a very difficult step to take. People learn in many other ways, or some just don't learn at all. For example, @ CAPS3 learned from his experience in school and struggled to find a job. Her grandmother told her just before she passed away because her grandmother probably experienced it too. Other people learn by meeting new people and just having fun with life, or like me, I have learned the hard way by not talking to a really good friend of mine during a head fight. empty. Laughter comes in many shapes and sizes, we as humans have to tackle it, whether it's an argument or learn it as you go. Somehow it will come and we have to be ready for it, it's not a scary thing. The benefits of laughter are that it makes you happy and people tend to have a good time. Laughter is a positive thing, and people shouldn't ignore it, it's a good stress reliever too. Laughter is a cause of cheerfulness, a fun and light spirit. Laughter is not only an important role in relationships, but plays a big role in life itself.

 Laugh at the bell of @ CAPS1. @ CAPS11 best friend and I have a lot of funny and hilarious memories together. We always laugh at something, even if @ CAPS7 is something completely silly or really funny. We laugh at things like people who look funny or people who say stupid things. We also laugh at the funny things we do. @ CAPS8 one thing that has always stuck to the head @ CAPS11, the bell time @ CAPS1. One day after school, me and my best friend @ CAPS11 @ PERSON1 decided to cross the street from our school and have lunch at @ CAPS1's bell. We ordered our food and went to sit and wait @ CAPS7. A few minutes later our food was ready and we sat down to eat @ CAPS7. “@ CAPS4” I told @ LOCATION1 as I took a bite of @ CAPS11 @ CAPS5 five layer burrito. "@ CAPS6" @ CAPS7 was really hot and burning @ CAPS11's mouth. Had to wait a few minuets to eat @ CAPS11 burrito. So the two of us sat down, waiting for our burritos to cool down, and talked about school and other things that were going on in our lives. A few minutes later a man walked in, he was about @ NUM1 or @ NUM2, and his back was to us so we couldn't see his face. The man ordered his food and turned to sit down. During this time I thought the burrito @ CAPS11 was chilled enough and I went to have a bite at the same time the man looked at us and he was wearing a clown mask and he had a little dog with a tiara on his head . Next thing I knew @ CAPS11's burrito was coming out of @ CAPS11's mouth and I was laughing to death. @ CAPS11 burrito was completely spat out of @ CAPS11's mouth, and all over me was a @ LOCATION1. Everywhere in the hair @ CAPS11, the mouth, the clothes and all over the table. I was so embarrassed I couldn't help but laugh @ CAPS8. I think the main reason I was laughing so hard was because the man looked so scary, @ CAPS8 wow we laughed for what seemed like an hour straight. You might think it was the end of the bad day @ CAPS11, @ CAPS8 @ CAPS7 only got worse. Eating @ CAPS11 burrito seemed like forever, because we were laughing forever. @ CAPS7 probably took me a good ten minutes to eat just one burrito. During this time, I got thirsty and needed something to drink. So I went to order a little drink and grab some @ CAPS10. As I walked back to the table @ CAPS11, I wasn't looking and came across a man standing in line. I almost knocked over @ CAPS11 @ CAPS10 @ CAPS8 luckily I didn't. Back at @ CAPS11 headquarters I was telling @ PERSON1 about @ CAPS11's bad day and how @ CAPS7 couldn't get any worse. Then I had a drink and started choking on @ CAPS11 @ CAPS10, @ CAPS7 was so bad I spat it all out @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS10 went flying everywhere, @ CAPS7 even came out of @ CAPS11 no. So I went to the bathroom and cleaned @ CAPS11 on my own, took a breath from @ CAPS11 and told @ PERSON1 that I was ready to go home. When I look back and think of the day at @ CAPS1 bell with @ CAPS11 best friend I don't just think about how embarrassing @ CAPS7 was for me and her, @ CAPS8 also @ CAPS7 was a really great and hilarious memory which I will probably remember for the rest of @ CAPS11's life. Like I said before @ CAPS11's best friend and I have a lot of fun memories together, and we always get more done every day.

 There is a difference between good and bad. Most of us learn from it and most of us don't. We all have a choice of either facing @ CAPS3 that we did wrong or lying about it and having even more problems than you already are. Have you ever wondered when you're about to do something bad and you don't think about it first? Well, that was one of those times I didn't think first. I was nine, @ ORGANIZATION1, @ PERSON1 and I were playing at the park jokingly, playing on the old rusty blue swing, having a good time. There's not much to do in a park other than hula hooping, running, going to the monkey bar which has tons of bacteria, going down the soaked slide, and playing cat if we have the energy. @ ORGANIZATION1 sees two broken down rusty cars that seem to have been there for centuries. @ ORGANIZATION1 says he comes out of his stupid brain “We should go over there and throw rocks at these cars, you guys.” I shake my head, nodding at @ ORGANIZATION1 with a big smile on my face. @ PERSON1 said with zero tolerance to put it all negatively, "@ CAPS1 we shouldn't have these cars owned by anyone. How would you feel if some foolish someone came and destroyed your car ?" I think for a second, well, he's right. I would flip my chicken if some silly kid did that to my car. We all look at each other and think of @ CAPS3 to do. Sixteen minutes pass and still nothing. With my dumb brain I say "@ CAPS2 don't these cars belong to anyone? @ PERSON1 goes and mumbles to himself" @ CAPS3 silly kid, I already know they are going to have trouble. " @ ORGANIZATION1 and I look at each other like we just saw a ghost. We finally start to walk towards the rusty broken down cars. On our way, with @ ORGANIZATION1's clumsy feet on a piece of wood. Finally arrived at the two rusty cars broken down, I pick up a rock. I think for a second to ask myself is it okay? should I do this? Just with sheer pressure and a bad conscience I threw the stone. L 'one after another they kept throwing rocks, pipes, car parts, logs and beating him with a gigantic metal pipe. @ ORGANIZATION1 and I leave, now that we are exhausted we take a break and look @ CAPS3 we did in those rusty cars down. The two cars appear to have been struck by a tornado. @ ORGANIZATION1 and I are just starting to laugh our heads off. We continued to laugh almost until we were about to get wet. There was @ CAPS1 one around and @ CAPS1 one saw us. At least that's @ CAPS3 we thought. It was about four days later and back to the park @ PERSON1 and me, and @ CAPS1 sign from @ ORGANIZATION1. About to come back from the park, a tall, blond, old lady with big feet comes up to us and asks us to get out of @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 "@ CAPS4 are you living? We were just kids at the time and I said without even thinking a little bit, "I'm leaving just down the street, it's the second to last house. I'll show you if you want? " The big footed lady responds" @ CAPS5 that would be great, thank you. " @ PERSON1 and I start walking home wondering why this lady wanted to know @ CAPS4 we live? Walk around the block and we see this lady's car in front of my house. @ PERSON1 and I look at each other and I knew he was thinking @ CAPS3. @ PERSON1 thought I'm screwed. The big-footed lady ended up owning those two broken rusty cars. I didn't know @ CAPS3 to say or do. Just the thought going through my mind telling me that I'm fucked up. I've never been so grounded and shouted loud in my life. If there are lessons from @ CAPS3 @ ORGANIZATION1, @ PERSON1, and I learned that it would be don't touch anything that doesn't belong to you, be respectful of @ CAPS3 isn't yours, treat everything with respect even if it's not yours, and stop being an idiot. child. This showed @ ORGANIZATION1, @ PERSON1 and myself right from wrong, tell the truth, face @ CAPS3 that we did wrong and thinks r to do something before your actions get you into trouble.

  Doze off in space, relaxed as I could be in a stuffy and hot room. @ CAPS1 is lying next to me, both of us thinking of things we could do. Nothing comes to mind. We both decided it was too hot to do anything outside and that there was nothing on TV. We thought we were just going to lie in bed all day, rotting in the heat. But then @ CAPS1 has this idea of playing video games. @ CAPS6, we turn up some music, blow up the stereo. Put on @ CAPS2 from @ CAPS3 and start killing people. @ CAPS6 was killing people, whipping their buttocks so to speak. Then @ CAPS1 says "@ CAPS5 I'm really tired, plus it's very hot." @ CAPS6 then I try to fix the AC power. @ CAPS6 I'm working on air conditioning and just lying in bed. Time has passed, it seems like it took forever for the day to end. We had nothing to do. We were stuck. Then @ CAPS1 started telling me a joke. I was a failure but it still made me laugh. @ CAPS6 was sitting on her bed telling herself jokes to pass the time. After a while the jokes get old, now she was sitting on her bed again. Fall asleep because there is nothing else you can do. The music is off, the window is open, @ CAPS6 all you can hear are cars driving by on the street. Out of nowhere @ CAPS1 farts, and it wasn't a girl's fart. It was loud and smelly. Immediately I start to laugh. While she locks herself in, I don't remember why but then I farted. She started to laugh. His face had turned red. @ CAPS6 we both started farting back and forth, reminder that we were in grade six. But nothing was as funny as it was when what was about to happen in my life. It's @ CAPS1's turn to fart, and she's getting ready more than she farting. But this one was not like the others! She stopped laughing right away, looked at me with a frown on her poor little face and said "@ CAPS10 I think I just pooped in my pants!" I started to laugh @ CAPS6 really loud, I started to cry. It was that bad. You could feel it. @ CAPS6 she starts walking towards the bathroom, and all I hear is "@ CAPS10 I just pooped my fucking pants !!"

 It was the first day of the ninth year, that terrifying day in which one must choose how they are to be viewed for the next four years. I walked into my first class looking like a hippie on steroids, just over six feet tall and nearly two hundred and sixty pounds as a long haired, freckled teenager. I was a giant, and it made it hard for bullies to muster machismo to treat me like the first year I was. I sat in my designated seat next to one of the girls who I could tell had too much self-esteem. Despite this off-putting first impression, I tried friendship. My attempt was met with confusion and disgust. As I turned to face the class again, the teacher stood there. @ PERSON1 announced that our first task was to create a presentation, a presentation that would show the rest of the class who we are. I was excited about a presentation. I've always been a showman, and the star is a dear friend. I like to play, sing and entertain in general. My gem is humor. I discovered that I could captivate an audience of any number, with humor. With this, I designed a presentation to trap and engage my class in the reality of who and what I am. I wrote a speech in which I explained my talents and the many things that I appreciate. In this speech there were many twists, punchlines and puns. There was such a laugh that other teachers came to see what was causing the noise. I bowed and sat in my seat, looking around at the bright faces of my new friends. I knew then and there that laughter would be the tool with which I would build my life as a high school student. I could make someone forget about their problems for a while, or brighten up someone's day with a few words. I was not a star athlete. I wasn't even a star student. But I seemed to collect friends like I was made of fly paper. There is no better feeling I have yet had that compares to the company of friends. As long as I have humor, I will never be without this feeling.

 I met my best friend, @ PERSON1, in third grade. Best friends are the people who come into your life and stay with you for the rest, through the easy times and the tough times. We learn from our best friends and share experiences with each other. No matter the distance, their friendship is always there for you, even if you are thousands of miles away or a few houses away. Laughter between two best friends is a bond that binds them together for life, because when two friends really laugh together, they will always have a little moment of their lives intertwined for as long as they live. @ PERSON1 and I grew up together. We were there for each other, learning to jump rope in school, broken bones, school girl dramas, crushes, boyfriends, heartaches, weddings and funerals. We have helped each other through everything from rough lessons to pet deaths. We offered advice and brought hot chocolate, but this is only the beginning of our friendship. Once the problems were resolved, we learned to laugh at our mistakes and move on. Together, we have overcome the slippages in what we say, to the point of sliding on the ground. After laughing at what the other did or said, we helped them get up and move on. @ PERSON1 and I know that whatever the situation we will always be there for each other because we support each other. @ PERSON1 can play a joke on any occasion. She is one of those friends who can make you smile just by seeing her face or hearing her voice. Most of the best times of my life have usually involved @ PERSON1 in one way or another. We have memories of lying in the aisle and staring at the stars at night, cracking up working behind the scenes at the local theater club. @ PERSON1 can always crack me up with his perfect knockoffs of anyone no matter how cranky I am. I crack @ PERSON1 all the time, usually unintentionally, by saying or doing something ridiculous, that shows my true blonde side. We laugh over lines from our favorite movies and note the funniest moments. We shared so many memories together that we laugh at everything from driving around town and listening to music to being followed by the employees at the mall kiosk. One of the funniest times we have ever had together was while we were working behind the scenes at a production at our local theater club. We laughed at everything from building sets to mistakes on stage. We had to open and close the curtains in the dark, while being completely black. I crushed each of my toes that week as I rolled the sets on and off the stage. My hair was a must-have from an audience perspective, even though I kept tucking it under a black ski cap. @ PERSON1 would still have a hard time opening one of the curtains that got stuck when it was half open. She must have tugged frantically on the rope even though she kept getting stuck in the pulley. I would laugh at her mistakes and she would laugh at mine. We both had a lot of fun watching the audience, the director, and the cast at the same time. @ PERSON1 and I had to stand in the back and watch all of the cast's mistakes, silently laughing to each other. Anytime one of the actors made a mistake, you could see the audience laughing and the director's face, who was usually horrified for a moment. Now every time we mention a word or line from this piece, we both start to crack up and remember the whole weekend. There were more jokes than we could ever write, and every time they are brought up we remember even funnier moments. When we're close to each other, a quick glance or a single word whispered through our beards can crack us both up. We can make each other laugh without even explaining what we meant because we have shared so many experiences that we can read our minds. A single key expression or twinkle in our eyes can crack the other down. Most of the other people around us probably wouldn't even notice the little crease in the corners of our eyes or a slight smile. These are the best codes ever imagined, because only the person for whom it is intended could understand it. Messages shared through the eyes of a best friend can silently conjure up topics that have never been talked about and make us laugh. This is why true best friends are linked by laughter, because it keeps them close no matter what, and for every moment of sadness there are two moments of laughter and happiness.

 Laughter has many benefits; happiness, joy, bond with others, adrenaline, helps release tension, and jokes that are made around you every day. Laughter is something that can be shared between people, especially when they are in the dumps. This emotion is the one that will brighten up every day and bring pleasure. Laughter has been a big part of my life. From family, friends, boyfriends and strangers, laughing has always been a big deal for me. I like being able to look at someone and see that they smile a lot, which means they probably laugh a lot and they're a happy person. How can I say this. Well, to begin with, there are dimples in their cheeks and crow's feet at the corners of their eyes. Really, crow's feet don't matter how old you are, they can occur while laughing, smiling all the time, and squinting in the sun. Most of the laughter that has helped my life is having a relationship. Usually when you have the laughter in the relationship it will make it last longer. The reason relationships will last longer is that you can be yourself and let the other person see that you are okay with having a laugh and being a part of their life. I believe that laughing in a relationship is the best part. Let's say your partner is in the trash, are you just going to leave him in a bad mood all day or are you going to try to make him laugh and cheer him up. When I'm in a relationship and my partner is in a bad mood, I do my best to cheer them up. I like to make people laugh. And when I'm a cranky guy my boyfriend is helpful and tries to make me feel better or he just comforts me to see what's wrong. So if there is no laughter in your relationship, obviously there will be no happiness. Therefore, it won't work between you and the person you're with. So spread the joy of life and make people happy. Another part of that laughter that has been in my life is friends. If you don't know me well let me tell you that I am shy at first but once I get to know you you will see that I am a very outgoing person. As most of my friends will say, it's just that I'm weird, but I love to laugh a lot and make other people laugh too. When I'm with my friends and in the dumps, someone will always make me laugh in the end. No matter how upset I am, they can still make me laugh at almost anything because I'm a really easy-going person. Being around these people is like watching a comedy movie or playing a role. They always find a way to be funny and boring. Like being obnoxious and doing stupid things that other people will never do because it's embarrassing. Well, just because it's embarrassing doesn't mean you shouldn't at least be doing it. If you don't, it will give us more to do and give us all the attention on ourselves. How do you know if it's funny or not if you don't want to try something new. How are you supposed to laugh at yourself and make others laugh with and at you no matter how silly it is. So don't hit it until you've tried it. The person who once said: " Laughter is the shortest distance between two people ". Is it true or false? Is this really the shortest or the longest distance? I honestly believe it could be a short distance. You don't want to be pushy or cranky all the time or you'll never make friends or have a relationship. And if you don't have any friends or relationships then that will make you laugh and have fun. If you are not a happy person then how are you going to experience the joys in life and all around you. You won't, so put a smile on your face and be a spontaneous person who isn't afraid. Laughter is a blessing for all men. And the laughter in my life has shown me so much, it has given me and others so much experience to enjoy. Those pleasures that have been explored are having boyfriends, friends, and family around me all the time. It is an emotion that is definitely one that will brighten up any day and bring happy expressions to everyone's faces. Share the laughter.

 Laughter is the best way to bring people together. It creates a bond that makes you feel a little more comfortable and secure. Life would be sad and depressing if it weren't for laughter. Everyone has a different type of laughter. Some people are loud, calm, weird, or funny. But our laughter is what makes us who we are. There are so many effects in the process of laughing. Your laughter can have such a strong effect on your body that your eyes can get a little watery. Sometimes when you laugh, it's also harder to breathe and your stomach may start to hurt. When something is really funny, I usually have a hard time getting our air back because I can't stop laughing. This is one of the effects that happens to me while I laugh. Everyone knows that when someone thinks of something funny, they laugh. We can laugh at a movie, a joke, or even a simple mistake. My family always makes me laugh. When we party we always laughed and made jokes. One of the jokes that my cousins would say is that my aunt's baby was so white it looks like a out of the lechera. Lechera is a @ CAPS1 word. Another thing that also made me laugh was when I went to my cousins' house. We were watching a movie and I had to go to the bathroom so I went and when I got out she jumped around the corner and scared me. I screamed so loud that my other cousin yelled from the top of the stairs to be quiet. I couldn't stop laughing, I was scared but it was funny because she scared me out of nowhere and I didn't expect her to do that. I think of laughter as a gift. It is something that can always brighten up our day. I love to laugh and there are so many unforgettable moments where I almost laughed until I peed my pants. I think the people with the best personalities are the ones who can make someone else laugh.

A @ CAPS1 Laugh @ CAPS2 you hear a child laugh what do you think? Do you think peace and happiness or what do you think? @ CAPS2 I hear a child laughing I think of my little sister. @ CAPS2 was outside playing peter pan or indoors playing with dolls she glows like a light and i can see her happiness. It's not just the laughter of my sisters that brings me joy, it's everyone! I think, however, that a @ CAPS1 laugh is the most unique! @ CAPS2 you hear your child, niece, nephew or grandchild laughing, you should hear happiness there. A laugh changes @ CAPS2 you get older. I remember hearing my sisters and brothers laughing at the simplest things @ CAPS2 they were younger. But now they never do, now they laugh at sick disgusting jokes and they laugh @ CAPS2 someone gets teased. But this is not my case. I'm the one who laughs @ CAPS2 someone doing something like on America's funniest home videos. But a kid laughs @ CAPS2 you make a face or @ CAPS2 an animal does something funny. They laugh at the smallest things. To me, a smile is just a silent laugh. I remember hearing a saying " A smile is worth a thousand words " and I think that goes for laughter too ! Even though there is no sound in a smile, there is a sound waiting to come out of that person ! I know for a fact that @ CAPS2 I was younger, I was abused and so @ CAPS2 something good never happened which rarely did, but I had a huge smile on my face and then someone would do something funny and i would try not to laugh but i only lasted @ NUM1 seconds then i laughed so hard i started to cry ! There was that exact moment that was the highlight of my life. One day I was just hanging out with my sister Linda and we were playing dolls. My father walked in and accidentally stepped on one of the dolls. Linda started to cry because the arm had been broken. But @ CAPS2 she started to cry my dad started to jump on one foot and hold the other then he fell on his butt. I laughed so much that afternoon! Then later that day he took me and Linda to the store to each buy a new doll ! Once again, @ MONTH1 say that a @ CAPS1 laugh is the most beautiful thing on earth ! Just for some reason it heals the soul! You @ MONTH1 start with a bad day and then you could come home at the end of the day and walk into your house with your kid laughing. Then your day suddenly improves ! I wish I was a kid again so I could go back and make things so much better than @ CAPS2 I was little ! I started out in a bad situation but now I'm a smart, smart young lady ! Each laugh is unique in its own way because everyone is different. Just because you're getting older doesn't mean your laughter does. But every laugh changes in one way or another, I don't know how, but it happens as you get older ! You laugh at different things and you laugh less than before!

 The boy also says @ CAPS2 : @ CAPS1 weighs ?, @ CAPS2 : what ? Boy : @ CAPS3, I just wanted to say something to break the ice too ! Laughter is the best thing to have in any type of relationship, such as family, friends, and a romantic type relationship. This brings good bondage and makes the relationship fun. It was @ DATE1 and I was about to take a good time without seeing a friend to go to a warped tour concert. We weren't on the best possible terms due to an issue that was with us a few months ago. I'm thinking of taking my friend @ CAPS4 to a gig that she's wanted to go to all year as well. When we finally got her back, there was all kinds of tension between the words not left, but I wasn't going to wait any longer to see what would happen, too. Before we went to the concert my parents decided to take a car wash, @ CAPS5 then I automatically thought of a few fun things I could do to make her laugh. The car moved as slowly as a turtle in the washing machine. I had left the window open until enough water seeped in. We were talking about the concert a bit and I looked very oblivious to the fact that my window was open, I actually had no idea that there was a lot more water than I expected. entered. She looked at me and felt like she was laughing so hard that she couldn't even see what was going on. I looked at her and it was like what? She was your windows open and I turned around and found the water rushing down and kinda scared me and I jumped in the air and rushed too close to the window. She was laughing like there was no tomorrow and so was I. From that point on, it was such an icebreaker for all the tension that was going on. the elephant was gone or aside and we had a good rest of the day. You see, it's true "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people". When laughter occurs, no one is really sad or crazy or anything. Laughter can also bring closer people who only meet good greetings, also couples who come closer, joy and happiness of friends and family. Laughter is really the key to happiness.

 Laughter is one of the most helpless things in life. even if from a simple joke to something amazing that happened to make a big event in time to share the story of family members. It helps you get through tough times or just make someone's day better and make them smile, or give them a joke to tell someone else to continue a chain of laughs with people. Sometimes it can be the most embarrassing thing people remember about you, but in the end the other person who laughs at you for your indecency has probably been doing something like this for a long time, so at the end of the day end, she laughs at herself and doesn't. I don't even realize it. I remember that on my fifteenth birthday, my grandmother took the family from the hole to dinner at a Chinese restaurant. It was quiet, except for the adults discussing what to order for family meals. I was sitting next to my sister looking at a menu just to see what they had to drink. Everyone laughed at her, even the son of the waitress who stood behind the two and her mother. It was doing everyday because it wasn't the best of days at the time. But you could tell she was embarrassed but laughed at herself when her comment at the table was "I thought I said it in my head" I looked here and said "no , you didn't "so she just shrugged. To this day, every time we go to a Chinese restaurant my mom looks here and "says they have your fricken chicken" so she looks here and "says it will die someday" we all looked here and said " no, it's going to be passed on to your kids, they'll be here pretty much over there on Mother's Chicken Day. " even though it's happened so long ago parents joke that it will be her wedding toast, it went kind of like "as long as you give her her chicken fricken you @ CAPS1 will last forever "it wasn't the nicest comment to make on this day but it was still funny for the rest of us. it is something that will last in the family for years to come and hopefully be passed on to generations to come. incident, she'll tell them herself and laugh about it just because it was just an irrelevant thing that had to happen. We always pester her about this and a lot of other things that she says out loud without realizing it. But these are stories for another time and another day, you never know what might happen. Remember to laugh it's true what they say it's healthy for you so make the most of the worst days possible. So if you are having a bad day you never know what might happen to give you a smile and a laugh, even if you are the one making everyone laugh. So think of something that makes you laugh and tell it to the people who are special in your life to make them laugh and make their day a little better than most. Even if it is one of the most embarrassing things to happen to you in your lifetime. When we were toddlers and we cried it was always the cure for some of the worst things, even if you grow up it means you can't laugh or it means different things than it used to be when you are depressed you need to laugh to feel better about yourself, don't let people put you down.

 I think laughter is a key part of any lasting relationship because if you didn't have to laugh it would be a boring relationship. Let me share with you a personal story of mine. I recently started dating my boyfriend and his name is @ CAPS1. We first met here at school, then he transferred and moved on, then a few months ago he added me on facebook and we started talking again. Back when we first started talking he had a girlfriend, but it wasn't long after he found me that he realized she was no longer for him. It was hard for him to break up with her but he did and I'm proud of him because she treated him so badly. At the start of our relationship, we were both very shy and didn't talk much, but the more we hang out, the more we start to talk. We want to be the type of couple who can talk to each other about everything in person like we do in texts. Every time I see it I get very nervous and almost feel like my heart is skipping a beat. Every time we walk down a street, I can't help but smile. And when we lay down on the cow and watch movies, I can't help but laugh when he tickles me. We laugh all the time, whether it's when one of us makes a mistake or something. I believe that laughter and the way we get along is what keeps us strong. Every time he leaves, I can't wait to see him again. Laughter is what keeps most relationships going because without it I feel like it would really be a while and if it's boring you wouldn't want to hang out with each other. Personally, I think every moment with your partner should be fully utilized.

 Everyone in life has siblings that they grew up with and love unconditionally, but for some of us, we haven't known our siblings until later in life. I myself was one of those people, but with a slight difference compared to others. I had what I like to call a @ PERSON1 who is actually my biological father. Until I was seven, I thought my dad @ PERSON2 was my quote on the "real dad" quote, but one night I heard my mom down the stairs yelling at someone on the phone. My mother would yell at this unknown figure about child support and give her rights over to my father. I had no idea she was talking about me and in fact each other @ DATE1 in the line was my biological father. The moment I heard your son deserved better than this I ran to my room and started crying because I thought @ PERSON2 was my dad, but now this new figure in my life is claiming the 'to be. My mother heard me running up the stairs and came to tell me the story of what was really going on. As it turned out that my biological father had rights to my last name and unless he ceded them to my father, my mother would sue him and make him pay the thousands of dollars he owed him for child support. During this little story that she revealed, I had learned that I had other brothers and sisters in the world. Over the next eight years of my life, I spent countless hours browsing old phone numbers and email addresses trying to find my other siblings. It wasn't until first grade that I met a guy who went to my school and was in the same class as me named @ PERSON3. He quickly became a good friend of mine and we spent time every other @ DATE1. On one occasion when he was at my house playing video games with me, he stumbled across the question of what my last name was. I thought it was a special question but in the @ DATE1 I told him. All of a sudden a smile spread across his face and he asked me if I had a biological father named @ CAPS1. My mind started to waver on this sudden question. @ PERSON3 started explaining to me that he was the half-brother of my sister @ CAPS2 who was one of the siblings I was looking for. Almost before @ CAPS3 thought of asking the question of how ; he called my sister and explained to her that he had found his brother. It turned out that she was looking for me as hard as I was looking for her. @ PERSON3 asked her if she would like to meet me and I heard a high pitched cry of joy from my sister say yes on the phone. I was thrilled at the idea, but had no idea how awkward it would be to finally meet her the next @ DATE1. On @ DATE1 I met my sister, @ CAPS4 mom came to pick me up to take me home. As we drove, so many thoughts were going through my head that I thought I was going to throw up in the car. When we finally got to her house, @ PERSON4 who is @ CAPS4 mom, pushed me out of the car and into the house where my sister whom I realized looked almost the same as me was sitting on the sofa, looking as nervous as me. Over the next four long, irritating hours my sister and I played @ NUM1 questions with each other to get to know each other. After doing this, we were more comfortable with each other and she seemed to accept much more that I was really her older brother. At @ DATE1, we were telling jokes and laughing hysterically. We realized that we even had the same obnoxious laughter (which everyone hated) and it made us laugh on the floor. At one point her mom had to tell us to calm down because we were going to wake the baby up if we didn't and by @ DATE1 from @ DATE1 we had connected with each other so much that she got me even gave a hug before leaving. @ CAPS2 and I connected the most through our laughter the first time we met and from this @ DATE1 until now ; every time we see each other we giggle and smile. Since we found each other or in my case his brother found me; I go to her house every other weekend. My sister is one of the most precious people I have in my life and that will never change because nothing we say or do will ever stop the laughter and joy we have for each other.

 We couldn't control ourselves, our eyes were crying and our stomachs ached so much that we couldn't move. I was choking on my words while talking to my best friend @ PERSON1. Every time we spoke, someone would say something we thought was funny and we would laugh and laugh. When I think back to the things we talked about, most of what we said didn't make any sense at all and I don't know why we laughed so hard. One day at our bus stop @ PERSON1 said something very funny and we laughed until the bus arrived. Then I said something funny and we laughed the whole bus ride to school. It happened almost every day for us. That day, we couldn't stop laughing, even arriving in our classroom. Our @ CAPS2 level teacher had a lot of pets in her classroom and one of her pets was a tree frog named @ CAPS1. This week was that of @ PERSON1 and my week to take care of him. When we went to feed him, @ PERSON1 grabbed him and made him dance all over his cage. We both thought it was the most hilarious thing ever. Our eyes started to cry and we were shocked at our words as we took our seats for the class. We laughed as the teacher gave instructions and as we did our classwork. Finally, our teacher had to come up to us and tell us to be calm. That didn't stop us from laughing. We tried and tried to stay calm and do our job, but we just couldn't stop. Many people in our class were chatty that day, but no one was laughing as loud as @ LOCATION1 and me. We were so loud that I thought the people in the class below us would hear us for sure. It wasn't just us who were loud, it was the whole class. Our teacher stood in front of the class and yelled at us to be calm but that didn't stop us. It actually made @ LOCATION1 and I laughed some more. I thought I was going to pee in my pants, I was laughing so hard. Now @ PERSON1 and I weren't the type of girl who silently laughed at certain things. We were the kind of girls who laughed very loudly and very loudly, with wet eyes and stomach muscles aching for the rest of the day. Our teacher wanted the whole class to be calm, so she came to the front of the class while we did our math problems. She told us to put down our pencils, push our chairs and stand behind, so we did. Then she told us to take a really deep breath and we did. Then she told us to let our cold breath out. Finally, we were supposed to do this five times, then sit back in our chairs and do our math problems in silence without speaking to anyone. When @ PERSON1 and I took our five deep breaths, we did them very quickly and very briefly to finish it off. We thought it was very funny, as were the rest of the class who saw us. The class started to laugh and the teacher didn't know what to do, so she told us that we should all stay at recess if we didn't behave. Eventually the class settled down and began to work quietly. Except for @ PERSON1 and me. We continued to laugh until the bell rang for the end of school. We got on the bus and started talking about how much fun we had that day and how funny it was when we were breathing really fast and not slowly like we were supposed to. Even to this day whenever a teacher or someone tells us to take deep breaths for something @ PERSON1 and I look at them and start laughing, then we breathe really fast. Now we are in the second year of high school and we still have times where we laugh uncontrollably for no reason. I think it's just part of being best friends with someone. Sometimes we even laugh all day like our day in @ CAPS2 class. Throughout our friendship we have learned to be much quieter when we do our breathing and when we laugh during a class or something important. I believe @ PERSON1 and I will always be best friends and always have our laughing moments together, whether in class, on the bus, while driving, at college or on the phone. Laughter is something that everyone should experience in their life. Not a little chuckle or a chuckle out loud but a really hard laugh where you can't control yourself your eyes cry and your stomach hurts too much to move just like @ PERSON1 and I did in @ CAPS2.

 It all started on a @ DATE1 after school when my girlfriend and I decided to make a plan to go home. We hadn't planned to walk home, we missed the bus. @ CAPS6, we started to walk down the high school ramp. As we walked, we got hungry. @ CAPS6 we went to the @ ORGANIZATION1. We ordered a @ CAPS1 and some drinks. @ PERSON1 decided to shake my soda @ CAPS13 hands it to me. I don't know what's going on @ CAPS6, I asked: "@ CAPS2 are you shaking my soda?" @ CAPS3 said: "@ CAPS4 I @ CAPS2 here is mine, let's trade." I have @ CAPS2 and ended up opening the one that @ CAPS3 rocked for real. “It was a bit sneaky! I said. @ CAPS6 when i got up to chase her and poor soda on her i tripped and fell on goat heads. While I was in pain, @ PERSON1 burst out laughing @ CAPS13 said: "@ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 stupid, stumbled upon a stump !" @ CAPS6 I got up from the ground and pulled out all the thorns, @ CAPS13 kept walking to my house. We were already more than half the way from my house when @ PERSON1 decided to hit me in the shin and run away. Of course, not having learned my lesson the first time, I continued it. I chased her for about a block and a half. Basically in my backyard before sliding on the mud, and @ CAPS13 fell into a puddle. I thought I was going to lose him when @ PERSON1 laughed too dramatically. On @ CAPS14, I jumped up and was going to put his face there. @ CAPS3 ended up running inside my house and locking the door. The reason I knew @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2 was locking it is because I ran @ CAPS6 quickly to get in. before @ CAPS2 i turned the knob, but it didn't open yet. Instead, the impact forced me to go back and land on poop. The bad part was that it was cool, why, well because my back was hot in a certain place. I quickly took off my shirt and threw it away, @ CAPS13 walked in to take a shower. @ PERSON1 asked me why I was going to take a shower, but I decided to lie to him. @ CAPS12 I told him what really happened, @ CAPS13 @ CAPS3 will laugh and laugh at me. After I finished taking my shower I asked @ PERSON1, "@ CAPS7 do you want to go shoot glass bottles in the back?" @ CAPS3 replied : "@ CAPS9 I'm down, let's go !" @ CAPS6 I installed six bottles and was ready to fire. First @ PERSON1 tried and hit four out of six. It's pretty good to be a girl. @ CAPS6 I went to replace the four @ CAPS3 shot bottles. While I was doing @ CAPS6 @ CAPS3 shot me in the ass. "@ CAPS11!" I screamed and wanted to cry, but I didn't. The only thing I have @ CAPS2 swore like @ CAPS14 else, and I pointed my gun at @ PERSON1 to retrieve it. It wasn't long before @ CAPS3 ran upstairs and grabbed my @ NUM1. @ CAPS3 said in a panicked voice, "@ CAPS12 you're getting closer, I'm going to throw this out the window!" @ CAPS13 I told him: "@ CAPS14 you won't, you know how much I paid for it!" @ CAPS15 my luck shot him in the leg. Turns out @ CAPS3 wasn't lying by throwing him out the window. It was ok though, because I could get another one. This @ DATE1 with @ PERSON1 was great, but @ CAPS3 made fun of me most of the time. I didn't care, whatever made her happy. I really like @ CAPS7 to make her smile. I endured a lot of pain that day and lost a shirt with poo on it. Everything is going well, it will be a great memory when we look back on that day.

I could just laugh to death. someone said. I ransacked the area. "@ CAPS37 ?" I said. "@ CAPS1 here son." I looked @ CAPS1 at the stairs to @ CAPS2 avenue. There was the voice witch that I had in herd. @ CAPS35 was just an old man, probably homeless judging by his looks. He had worn shoes, dirty blue jeans, a ripe shirt under a worn jacket. "@ CAPS3, @ CAPS31 @ CAPS33 a little lost" said the old man. "@ CAPS4 I'm @ CAPS73 lost" @ PERSON1 said. His pocket began to vibrate. @ PERSON1 put his hand in his pocket and took out his cell phone. He opened @ CAPS35 and read : @ CAPS31 coming soon ? Tommey typed: your brother is just going to @ CAPS2 ave now. Message sent. @ PERSON1 started to climb the stairs. “@ CAPS5 @ CAPS31 later old man,” @ PERSON1 said as he rushed to meet his friends. @ PERSON1 saw his friends on the @ CAPS62 site all standing outside the bakery @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7. "@ CAPS3, guys @ CAPS33 @ CAPS35's @ PERSON1 !" @ CAPS34 @ PERSON2. @ PERSON2 ran to @ LOCATION1. @ PERSON1 saved it @ CAPS1 and spun it around before putting it @ CAPS66 @ CAPS19. @ CAPS62 walked over to the group. "@ CAPS37 took @ CAPS31 so long man," @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 said. "@ CAPS11, @ CAPS63 the shortcut I took turned out to be, @ CAPS73 short" @ PERSON1 repiled. “@ CAPS12 don't worry he's just in a bad mood,” @ CAPS13 said. "@ CAPS14" replied @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10. "@ CAPS3, guys, can we go to @ CAPS18 @ CAPS19's toy store !!" asked @ PERSON2. "@ CAPS20 okay" replied @ CAPS13 @ CAPS22. The group continued @ CAPS19 @ CAPS2 avenue @ CAPS24 turned right on the street @ ORGANIZATION1, @ CAPS24 again right on @ CAPS25 avenue. The store was located halfway @ CAPS19 in the middle of other shops. “@ CAPS26 was there,” @ PERSON2 said as she turned around in excitement. "@ CAPS24 let's get in" said @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10. "@ CAPS30 old grebelin !" said @ PERSON2. "shh mu ha ha ha" @ CAPS31 said @ CAPS13. "@ CAPS32" he muttered. Once inside the store, @ CAPS35 looked like someone had @ CAPS9 turned on the @ CAPS9 lights. @ CAPS73 only that but the store was filled from top to bottom with @ CAPS38 but toys. The toys ranged from small to large to huge. There were all kinds of different types. "@ CAPS33" @ CAPS34 @ PERSON2. "@ CAPS35 is a rabbit @ CAPS43 !" "@ CAPS35 will choke @ CAPS31 in your sleep" "@ CAPS37 eats @ CAPS31 ?" said @ PERSON1. "@ CAPS38" grumbled @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10. WACK ! The rabbit connected with the face of @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10. "@ CAPS43 meenie" "@ CAPS44, that's @ CAPS35" he took a lion from the shelf and threw @ CAPS35 at @ LOCATION2. "@ CAPS3, don't be mean to her !" said @ CAPS13 imagining @ CAPS1 a monster and thrown @ CAPS35 to @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10. @ CAPS35 missed and hit @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 threw @ CAPS35 @ CAPS66 to @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10. "It's @ CAPS35" I @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 challenge @ CAPS31. SMAK. "@ CAPS52" @ CAPS53 this. @ CAPS53 that. @ CAPS54 @ CAPS54 @ CAPS31 foam. @ CAPS31 can't get me. WAM ! Ha ha I'm ausome. TWACK ! "@ CAPS55" @ CAPS34 someone. @ CAPS62 @ CAPS56. "@ CAPS31 kids are having trouble with @ CAPS43 !" cried the owner. “@ CAPS31 better put all those @ CAPS66 toys where @ CAPS62 was,” he warned. “@ CAPS59! I think we got a little carried away,” @ CAPS13 said. "A little !! My toy store is a mess! Now clean yourself up" "@ CAPS61" @ CAPS62 all sighed. "@ CAPS63 that was cool" siad @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10. "@ CAPS66 from the wicked planet, isn't it ?" teased @ PERSON1. "@ CAPS67 i @ CAPS20 am" replied @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10. “yeah that was fun,” @ CAPS13 said. "@ CAPS71 @ CAPS35 was !!" replied @ PERSON2. "We all looked pretty dumb, huh," @ CAPS13 said, blushing. “@ CAPS67, but how many people can say @ CAPS62 got into a fight in a toy store,” @ PERSON1 replied. "@ CAPS73 a lot I guess !" "@ CAPS74 talks more about cleaning, cleaning, cleaning !" @ CAPS34 the store owner. "Yes sir" @ PERSON2 solved the owner. "@ CAPS76 @ CAPS31 ..." "@ CAPS77" The group of children laughed.

I tend to always put myself in awkward situations with the people I love, but that's just life, isn't it? When you're a kid you tend to be dramatic about every little thing, and those who love you @ DATE1 are trying to teach you something @ DATE1 or guide you the right way. Or maybe it was just me, haha? I left my fathers with a horrible bang. I wanted to live my life my way, which only pushed back the people I needed most. I realized this a little too late. But then again, it's just life, right? Around @ DATE1, I finally "rekindled the flame" with my dad. It was the hardest thing to do, considering that my mother-in-law hates me. @ DATE1 which will obviously never change. So it's just something I'm going to have to deal with. My dad @ DATE1 still had the most delicate relationship, until about a few months ago when we went on a fishing trip together. Standing there, throwing away there was nothing said. We both see ourselves as pretty humorous people, but even our jokes weren't breaking the ice. We finally started making the conversation @ DATE1 he started telling me about when I was a kid when I went to @ DATE1 to visit my mom for the first time then came back to my grandma @ DATE1 calling it a ...... bad word ... but I won't say which one. My dad has never really cursed around me before, I guess this is the time for you. It was pretty funny all those stories he told me, @ DATE1 the way he explained them. It made us both laugh. @ DATE1 really brought us together again.

 Have you ever laughed so hard you couldn't really breathe or started to cry? Well I can tell you I do this all the time and laughing is a part of my life. I remember when my family and I all went out for dinner one night. My grandfather wanted to go out and get some Chinese food at @ LOCATION1, so my mom, little brother, grandma, grandfather, friend @ CAPS1 and I all went out to eat Chinese @ CAPS2. This moment was memorable because it was the night the whole table laughed at @ CAPS1 and me. When @ CAPS1 and I finished preparing our food, the waiter brought us our appitzers and that's when the laughs and giggles came out. It had been ten minutes talking to @ CAPS1 about this boy she loved and when she said the name my crab puff hit her I couldn't help but laugh so hard and so strong. As @ CAPS1 and I were sitting there laughing at what just happened I saw that @ CAPS1 couldn't really open her mouth because she was laughing too hard and her cheeks hurt from laughing, she finished by drooling into the little bowl of sauce that there was soy sauce in it, and seeing that, I knew I couldn't help but tell her at all. The night ended when @ CAPS1 ended up throwing his water on the server's son. I had to apologize to the waiter that night and his son. Her son said it was okay because it happens to him all the time. Laughter is an integral part of people's lives because laughter can make you happy, make people smile, and create memories.

 This is my second time going to @ ORGANIZATION1 and can't wait to do all the rides. The lines are extremely long, but I'm with a family that I haven't seen in a while, so we talk and catch up. My uncle who is there with us tends to play tricks on the children and embarrass me. He gave me wedges, put his children's diapers under my pillow and a lot of other crazy stuff. I knew this trip would be no different so I tried to stay away from any plans he had in mind. @ CAPS1 was gonna be a pretty hot day today, so I put on some basketball shorts and a t-shirt. We left with five kids under @ NUM1 so I knew we would be doing smaller rides. After we went to "@ CAPS1's a small @ ORGANIZATION1", we decided that @ CAPS1 was time to go to the bigger rides, but we would need lunch first. We went to a burger store and were waiting for our food, so my uncle and I decided to get into a spitball war. We were shooting across the island from table to table, trying to avoid passers-by. I hit him twice on the side of the cheek so he told me I won. After we had eaten our food and got out to leave, he said, "@ CAPS2 see who can hold your little brother over their head the longest." I didn't think of @ CAPS1 and said, "It's easy !" and lifted my brother up. I didn't know it was a big mistake. He walked over and put pants on me in the middle of the aisle. I was standing there with a child over my head and my pants at my ankles. People seated at tables watched and laughed as they saw it all happening. I was so embarrassed, how could I be so stupid to fall into his trap. I couldn't believe I fell in love with @ CAPS1 again. @ CAPS1 arrived so fast and I had no idea what to do other than laugh inside. After that we decided to head to space mountain to get some quick passes. They let you not have to queue and go to the front, but they could only be used during certain times. We had to wait about twenty minutes and @ CAPS1 was raining. So we put on our blue @ ORGANIZATION2 ponchos and the kids were playing cat. My brothers were crazy loud kids who always have energy and can't stop running. They kept coming up behind me, hitting me on the back and running away. After about the fifth time I couldn't take @ CAPS1 anymore so I told them if they hit me again they were going to get hit back. After about two minutes I was hit in the back again so I turned around and walked over to a kid in a blue poncho and hit him on the back of the head. I had no idea I had just hit a random little boy on the back of the head. I felt horrible as the kid looked at me blankly, wondering what had just happened. I was so embarrassed that I ran and hid behind a tree while my uncle and parents apologized for what I had done. Even though my family was embarrassed for what I had done, they were laughing hysterically inside at the same time. I had no idea that the child was not my brother and I could only imagine how this child was feeling.

 Laughter is part of my life. When I laugh, I always have this feeling of happiness and a connection with other people. Laughter makes any relationship stronger. I remember when I was sad I was going to talk to my friend @ PERSON2. I went to see him because we could talk about why I felt like this. Then after a while we were laughing - we were happy. Laughter brought me closer to my friend. We were able to understand each other. We've been friends since we were in elementary school. Because of the laughter in our relationship and the memories of the days we laughed, it made that relationship last. I was angry with my friend and he was angry with me. But because of all the good times, we had a good laugh. We are still great friends. Here's a moment when laughter was in one of my friends relationships. @ PERSON2, @ PERSON1 and I were at @ ORGANIZATION1. It was a @ DATE1. We would listen to music and talk about stuff. We didn't do much that day. Except the thing they were about to do. Out of nowhere, @ PERSON2's little nephew starts dancing and laughing while doing it. @ PERSON1 gets up and does the same. @ PERSON2 then gets up too - that was something I never expected to happen. They chose a certain song and did a dance for it. All the while we were all having a great time. They all looked funny dancing. After a while @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 got tired. But we kept laughing because @ PERSON2's nephew kept dancing. They danced to this song a few other times than @ DATE1. It was still funny for me last time because it was the first time they did it. Laughter has connected my friendship many other times. This one though, is the one I remember the most because it was funny. I remember it like it was last week. Being happy in a relationship makes it last a long time. That's why I think laughter is important and it really makes any relationship stronger. I have this story to prove it.

  College was a difficult environment. Not only are children subject to rapid change in the academic environment, but also to a mature social environment. The growing need for social domination and, in turn, the bulging ego make it a breeding ground for bullying. Without the skill to laugh about it, I would fear for the mental well-being of anyone in this environment. Throughout my early years @ NUM1 in college, I struggled with the social discomfort of classmates higher up the social chain, which severely affected @ CAPS1 not only my self-esteem, but my academics as well. . The stress of my own social stature caused my grades to drop, continuing a cycle of even more stress. The whole situation seemed hopeless and depressing. I couldn't believe that in just over a decade of life, my prospects had grown so bleak. I wondered how I was going to spend the rest of my school years. Every day I have had the pleasure of hearing a number of new slurs invented by the higher up the social ladder, trying to supplement their growing self-esteem and swelling egos ; @ CAPS1 some days even those I thought were my friends joined them. With the exception of a few trusted companions, it seemed like the whole world was looking to improve itself by disparaging me with a number of new insults. The daily mockery continued until I realized something; This laughter is the key to social survival. Without laughing, I could never have survived those school years. After this revelation, I was able to laugh at the things I was told and laugh at myself too. I was able to take the cacophony and learn with it, taking it as a criticism to improve myself. Through laughter and their discordant remarks, I was able to secure my position in the social scheme as well as improve my intelligence, as well as make new and better friends and achieve peace with others, while maintaining the pain that I have felt before. "popular" without having to make fun of those who were like me; @ CAPS2 a win-win scenario. Laughter is essential in any situation, whether it's a conversation with a friend or experiencing the accumulated frustrations of immature teenagers. From laughter I learned a great lesson, one that I hope not everyone has learned should. Without the lesson of laughter, I don't know how anyone could lead a successful and enjoyable life.

 They say laughter is the best medicine there is. So to tell you the truth about this qoate, I am going to tell you a true story about laughter and how it is a drug. I've already recognized by believing it myself. I will also explain its key element in a part of the world. So to start I will tell you a funny story in which some eds were arranged between my grandpa @ CAPS1 and my cousin @ PERSON1. For starters, this had happened roughly during @ DATE1. We were all having fun. There were my cousins @ PERSON2, @ PERSON4, and little brother @ PERSON3, @ PERSON1 and me. So @ PERSON2, @ PERSON4 and I were busy playing games while our grandpa watched us play and then out of here we were here a loud slap then weeping and screaming. So it turned out that @ PERSON1 "slipped" and slapped @ PERSON3 who is only seven years old. Then our grandfather started screaming and trying to figure out what had happened. After seeing @ PERSON3's back with a big red hand mark on it, that's when Grandpa really went wild and started going ballistic all over @ PERSON1 but then @ PERSON1 came home him on all tracks. Later @ PERSON1 came back, then Grandpa and I sat down at the table to talk to him. That's when I mentioned something that started making everyone laugh so hard they all forgot what had happened then he apologized to @ PERSON3 and we were all happy by the time grandma came home from work. So to conclude my story, I want to remind you why laughter is an element or if it plays a role in something that was a true story in some part of my life. So thank you for listening and when you or someone is on the brink or just really crazy laughter is the cure for work.

 I've heard people say that a smile makes a big difference on a first date, in a relationship, or just walking past people on the street. If someone has had a bad @ CAPS2, not only should a smile make it better, but also a few laughs to accompany that genuine smile. I like to walk down the street on a nice and beautiful @ CAPS2 and walk past the locals, I know that smile, laugh and give a little wave to show that they appreciate @ CAPS2 as much as I do. Missing out on someone I don't know at @ MONTH1 also has its perks. A glance to see their face can tell me if they have a good @ CAPS2 or a bad @ CAPS2. Either way, I smile. A smile to show it's a good @ CAPS2 or an encouraging smile to let them know it will get better. I love the feeling I have @ CAPS12 I am meeting someone and I know we connected well. A good first impression is very important to me because it can determine how the friendship will go and how long it can last. I now know that I love being with someone like me who loves to smile and laugh. I can't really see myself around a serious person and I know that if I was we would clash and have problems because I am loud and if they are serious then there would be problems and we couldn't collaborate on decisions. @ CAPS12 I first met my friend @ CAPS1, I was nervous and scared because we had been organized as a blind date by a mutual friend. It was a double date @ CAPS2 of @ ORGANIZATION1 with our friend and my cousin. @ CAPS12 guys picked us first, I got in the car and the first thing I remember was seeing a big smile on this guy's face. Eventually I got more nervous and started to stutter as we started talking. As the date progressed he seemed like a down to earth guy and always seemed to have a smile on his face and laughter seemed to flow from him. Over time, we've grown closer than I ever thought possible. I had no idea where our friendship would take us, but it wasn't long before it became apparent that he loved me and that I loved him. We went there slowly, without rushing. We had long conversations that lasted for hours and we always seemed to laugh about everything. He made everything better and better every time we spoke. Having pretty much the same personality and still smiling and laughing helped us connect right away. The other night, @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS4, our mutual friend, came to visit my cousin @ PERSON1 and I at her house. We were all laughing and enjoying each other's company @ CAPS12 @ CAPS4 and @ PERSON1 decided to go to the store and buy things using @ CAPS1's car. As they weren't going to be gone for long, @ CAPS1 and I decided to wait inside. A few minutes later, as we were sitting talking to each other, @ CAPS4 and @ PERSON1 rushed into the house looking flushed, breathless, scared and nervous about something. @ CAPS4 didn't want to look at us, so @ PERSON1 told us to go outside, something had happened to the car. As we stood there I realized the car was nowhere in sight in the driveway, so I grew suspicious. We asked them where the car was and they pointed to the road and in the dark all we could see was the faint silhouette of a car in the ditch. I expected @ CAPS1 to get angry and say something to @ CAPS4, who seemed like he didn't know what to say, but instead he smiled, walked over to the car and said, "@ CAPS11 don't worry, the car is fine. " @ CAPS12 he said that, he started to laugh, his laugh amazing. I was still in shock and so @ CAPS12 I heard his laughter, I turned and looked at him, and realizing he was happy and didn't seem to care about the accident, j 'I started laughing too and in less than NUM1 seconds he started to laugh, not only was the four of us who were laughing, but two of my other cousins who had joined us on the outside. Laughter made it better and I appreciated that we could all laugh at the smallest, the unexpected and the worst as well as the best. What also made me happy was the fact that the same night after the incident @ CAPS1 asked me the question I was hoping to hear and the way he said it made me laugh. , which then made him laugh. I answered his question with a hug and a yes and he brought a banquet of roses. As we walked in, my cousins and my aunt began to applaud and we all started laughing with a smile.

Most people think that laughter helps you live longer, love longer, and show who you really are. I believe all of this to be true, laughing is one of the most important things a person can do. In my life, laughter has helped me overcome the most difficult situations and make them much better. You can laugh a lot with your friends, family, or people you barely know. Laughter can mend relationships and help you get thrown out of anything, in my life I have found this out many times. My mom and I haven't always had the best relationship, we don't always get along, and since I have a severe separation anxiety from her, we spend a lot of time together, which can cause friction. from being too together. There was a time when we had just argued about me wanting to go somewhere and she wouldn't let me, I expected her to be mad at me for a while for how bad I was rude. We didn't speak for a few hours and tried to stay away from each other, we only spoke if it was really important. After a few days of this I went to her room to talk to her about everything, when we spoke I understood why she was so angry with me and I apologized and left her room but I could still feel there was some tension between us. I wanted to make things better more than I ever wanted anything, I wasn't really sure she was ready to get through this fight so I thought it would be better to give her a little of space and let her come to me when she was ready to speak. We both tried to stay away from each other for the rest of the day, trying to calm down and really think about what we were really crazy about. The next day we went into town to do something shopping and see some family. At first we didn't really talk much or anything. Within an hour of leaving home and spending time alone together, we were joking and laughing at everything we said. After our shopping we went out for lunch, it was the most fun time I ever had with my mom, we talked about everything, laughed and had a great time. The days that followed were wonderful too, we spent a lot of time together and felt like we didn't want to leave each other, I know laughing together and talking really helped with that, we opened up on each other. to one another like we had never done before. I love my mom and take care of her more than anyone in the world, when we got into this fight I was afraid the relationship would never be the same again, we were able to work it out by laughing. I honestly believe that laughter can heal everything from a broken heart to a broken family.

 Laughter is important in many ways. It can help you resolve an argument with a friend, improve your health, and help you in difficult situations. All relationships need a little laughter to ease the mood every now and then. If we didn't have it, everything would be taken seriously all the time, and there would be a lot more bickering. One example where laughter helped is when my best friend, @ PERSON1, and I were in a big argument over someone spilling paint on some shorts she owned. We were both blaming each other, and the more that happened, the worse the fight overall got. I remember right in the middle of the fight, @ PERSON1 made a face which for some reason made me laugh. Once I laughed I could tell she wasn't amused. She started to wonder why I was laughing. So I explained to her why I had laughed, and she ran into the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror, made the same face I had laughed at. To my surprise, she laughed too. After the ten minute giggle fit, I made a joke about the paint on her shorts, and we decided to splash paint on them for a rather "unique" look. Needless to say, the laughter saved us from getting into an even bigger argument. When people are angry or upset, they probably don't feel very well physically. They @ MONTH1 feel angry for days on end, which in turn can cause them physical pain. I know if I'm angry long enough I'm going to succumb to a headache and ironically I'm more angry with people around me for having a headache and they make it worse. Laughter is one way of doing @ CAPS1. Not necessarily carefree, but learning to let go and to live. Laughter greatly affects physical health. As well as mental health. Everyone needs to laugh to stay sane. Learning how not to sweat the little things is really important. What I prefer to hear is " let go of the laughter ". @ CAPS1 laughing at a problem is the best way to get rid of problems. I've also noticed that when you laugh more, you feel better overall. You have more energy, but it's usually because of the endorphins that go off when you have a giggle. But also it lightens the mood tones when you are with other people. Everyone needs to laugh. Married couples, students, teachers and best friends. Laughter can bring people together. Ultimately, laughing can benefit you in so many ways. It can help resolve quarrels, lighten mood, and have good effects on your mental and physical health. And the best thing to always remember is to let go of laughing.

 There is @ CAPS28 more fun than going to a friend's house after church. It's like a comedic relief in life after a rude post in the heart of @ CAPS10. In @ CAPS1, going to your friend's house is even better when your friend is, to put it mildly, a little crazy like @ CAPS10. Which for my story might be interpreted as a bad thing but for me it's @ CAPS28 but a good thing. My friend and I had some of the craziest times together, and the funny thing is @ CAPS6 doesn't have to do anything illegal either ! It's such a bonus! We have our giggles as we clean up, play with magnets, and watch theVampire @ CAPS2, and so much more. Strange? Yes. Fun? Too much. Let me tell @ CAPS10 something that happened to my lovely friend and me. First, as always, there's a @ DATE1 and I'm going to my good friend's house. It's a very short walk, I leave my church at midnight and am there at midnight five. I go up the steps, I am at his door, I open it. Bark bark bark! "@ CAPS3 up, @ PERSON1", @ CAPS4 shouts from another room. The snowzer puppy comes to greet me. He knows better @ CAPS11. The only dog eats stones for @ CAPS5 sakes. But @ DATE2, @ CAPS15 has their reasons for screaming and being a little cranky. "I didn't realize how many dishes there were! My sister will freak out if @ CAPS15 knows you're here and they're not ready." "@ CAPS6 don't worry, I'll help @ CAPS10, and we'll finish them off before your sister knows it." @ CAPS7, let's go. @ CAPS4 frantically asks the house for dishes and puts them in the sink. @ CAPS7, I work to put the clean ones in the dishwasher. We hear a noise from his sister's room, and we jump. @ CAPS4's sister sounds like @ CAPS15 is waking up but @ CAPS7 sniffles and the noise stops. @ CAPS7 we get back to work. When we finished we @ CAPS21 slumped on the couch looking at each other. We @ CAPS21 were tired and our hearts were still racing. @ CAPS7, her sister sniffles again. we laugh hysterically and her sister tells us from @ CAPS3. @ CAPS7 another day I come and we are really hungry @ CAPS21. We @ CAPS21 haven't eaten all day and are going to his kitchen. "@ CAPS8 does @ CAPS10 want to eat," @ CAPS15 asked me. "I don't know @ CAPS6. @ CAPS8 does @ CAPS10 want to eat," I replied. "I don't know @ CAPS6", the endless cycle. But, @ CAPS7, my eyes meet a bag of chocolate mint chocolate chips. @ CAPS4 looks down and sees the bag, and smiles. "@ CAPS9 !!" I am delighted, "@ CAPS9 !!" we @ CAPS21 are screaming with joy at the idea. We put it all together and start creating @ CAPS9. Now @ CAPS21 from @ CAPS16 are really "great cooks" so when we were faced with "who should flip the @ CAPS9" it was a puzzle @ CAPS11. "@ CAPS10 do it !" "@ CAPS11, @ CAPS10 do it !!" We had a fight until I realized the pancake was about to burn, and @ CAPS7, I actually "do it" for the sake of the mint chocolate chips @ CAPS9. But, when I turned him over, he didn't really want to end his embrace with the hot pan and shattered into pieces. Lots of “ stupid pancakes ” were said and spread throughout his kitchen. But, in the end, we ate and we were fortunately full. @ CAPS7 came another @ DATE1, and this time @ CAPS4 got a surprise. "I thought this show was really cool !! It's called Vampire @ CAPS2!" I thought for a moment, "@ CAPS14." @ CAPS15 immediately dragged me to his computer where @ CAPS15 downloaded them. I was like, "Are these cheap knockoffs of Twilight ?" We started to watch them and they looked cool, I liked them a lot. The vampire brothers were in turmoil with each other, screaming and questioning. "@ CAPS16 @ CAPS19 for the taste of his blood !" I paused the nonexistent thought in my head : "Did @ CAPS8 say ?" "@ CAPS16 @ CAPS19 for the taste of his blood", @ CAPS15 looked at me. I burst out laughing, "@ CAPS20. I thought he said, @ CAPS16 @ CAPS19 @ CAPS8 his butt tastes like, wow I feel shiny!" @ CAPS21 of us start to laugh like crazy at the very stupid thing I said. We laughed the rest of the night with @ CAPS16 that. We finish watching a few episodes and @ CAPS7 my mom is coming. I grab my coat and the rest of my junk and head for the door. the dog is still barking, but @ CAPS4 goes out with me, we hug and say goodbye. "@ CAPS23, I'll talk to @ CAPS10 later, @ CAPS4," I said as I walked down the stairs, "@ CAPS25, see @ CAPS10 at school tomorrow." "@ CAPS26. And see @ CAPS10 the next @ DATE1 !" I scream from the car window. @ CAPS15 yells back, "@ CAPS27!" @ CAPS28 is more fun than that, a friends house on @ DATE1 @ TIME1. Especially with some crazy stuff, like me and my mate, dirty dishes, a stupid dog, @ CAPS9 sticking to the pan, and Vampire @ CAPS2 with my bad hearing.

 "@ PERSON1, @ CAPS1 up ! It's almost time to go to school !" @ CAPS2 mom screamed at the frizzy hair, eyes half open and the boy in laces. It's me. Today is a first day of @ CAPS2's first new college. Our family moved to a new place, which is why I also had to move a school. I woke up and took a shower and wore school uniforms @ CAPS2 with an excited and nervous mind because I didn't know anyone from the new school @ CAPS6. When I got to school, students the same age as me started shouting out loud about the sadness of the approaching school days or the excitement of seeing their friends again. On the other hand, I was depressed and confused about these hyper students and the new school. I shook @ CAPS2's head and started focusing on finding the @ CAPS2 class. '@ CAPS3 hah ! Here it is.' @ CAPS4 I found the class @ CAPS2 and when I walked in @ CAPS5 looked at me curiously for a while as I was the "new" kid from school @ CAPS6. I sat alone and waited for the teacher to come. While I was waiting I put @ CAPS2 head down and slept a bit without a smile on @ CAPS2's face. Suddenly the teacher opened the door and spoke out loud : "@ CAPS5 sit down and shut up !" Teacher @ CAPS6 has to be the toughest teacher I've ever seen. While the teacher was writing something on the whiteboard, the students were talking about the teacher's first sight. It was terrible yelling at the student when you first saw him. For example, I knew a child who went to a private school and was transferred to a public school. I had the same class with him and I was his partner. As I didn't know him very well, I started asking him questions. At first he answered me kindly and I thought, " We could be close friends of the @ CAPS6 class ". @ CAPS7 that was wrong. He started talking to me loudly when the teacher was explaining something to us and it got me in trouble for talking to him. Other students hated him because he was distracted during lessons and he often asked unnecessary questions of the teacher very loudly. Plus, he had the strangest scent of perfume he thought was cool to wear. @ CAPS5 thought he was boring, which caused a little scuffle. @ CAPS8 arguing with other friends he stopped coming to school and now we don't even know where he is. Like @ CAPS6, it shows that first glance really matters in dealing with others. When I heard that the first sight really matters from other students who were sitting behind me, it changed the mind of @ CAPS2 to an open mind like having a smile on @ CAPS2's face. I thought, " I shouldn't be like the first glance of this kind of teacher." Maybe I should change @ CAPS2's face with a smile and some confidence. ' @ CAPS8 this class I started to smile on @ CAPS2's face and thought positively. I tried to attend the course and worked hard to make new friends at the new school. Therefore, the other student also opened his mind and started asking questions about me. For example, it was like these questions; " Why did you come to school @ CAPS6 ?" "," Which sports do you like the most ? "," What game do you play ? ", And etc. From these aggressive questions, laughter can change @ CAPS2's appearance and create good relationships. How did I know? When I first walked into the @ CAPS2 class with an ominous face, @ CAPS5 just looked at me and looked like he didn't want to know to me. @ CAPS8 putting laughter on @ CAPS2's face, they started to feel more comfortable than the first time. Changing my depressed face was the starting point for @ CAPS2 in the new school. I started to make a lot of friends, which became a way for me to be a class leader. I felt really amazing and awesome to see how "the new guy" can be the leader of the @ CAPS6 class. I felt proud of myself and thought about how happy I started laughing on @ CAPS2's face because the teacher didn't look good without laughing.

Do you know how people say school is the funniest place during the day? Well I should be okay with that because when I'm in school I laugh all day when I see my friend's name @ PERSON1. We had fun all day just the three of us in the same classes but two classes but we still laugh in the hallways and in the classrooms sometimes at each other and at people we don't know. I always liked coming to school last year, but this year is not much fun because @ PERSON1 has moved into @ CAPS1-es and I don't know where she lives now, but after leaving @ PERSON1, the good old days were fun with her. it sucks that we don't go to the same schools with her or her who always comes to school with us now it's just the two of us @ LOCATION1 and myself barely having fun in class without her but most of the time we do. I remember when @ PERSON1 first came to this school she looked like the other girls in our class, but once we got to know her we became best friends. the next day she thought we wouldn't like her because she was a new kid in school and stuff like that we know her well because we were hanging out with the etcher teacher back from seventh year we hung out. What I always love about @ PERSON1 is that she would turn anyone who is having a bad day and make it a really good day for you, she would always do things like that, but there are days where she is depressed. and @ PERSON2 and I were trying to make her feel but she would get mad at us because we weren't there for her when she needed us. I felt so bad after that but we are friends and buddies so post to be there no matter what. The next day she wouldn't remember what happened yesterday because she wouldn't remember much when she was really mad at someone. once in one of my classes we weren't doing much in that class because there weren't a lot of people in there we were painting and me and @ PERSON1 were painting a bulletin board. the colors were white and brown, we kind of have it all over the place and one on top of the other, I panted her hand in brown and the other side in white and she put some of it on the paper that we were using to let it dry so we could paint again but it didn't work out so well because we had to go to our next class. The next day we were in this class, we have almost the same thing, but we kind of have it on the big one, the sink, the sops chute, and on top of each other we draw a small something on top of the other, I draw a heart named after her. the name was in pen and the heart was painted. In our next class we laughed the rest of the day, we even made my sister @ LOCATION1 laugh with us even though it wasn't that funny because we ate a lot of candy and the candies make us laugh all the time . those days are the days that I will remember all the time because @ PERSON1, @ LOCATION1, and I always laugh all the time because we always find something to laugh about and talk about. Of all the times I laugh, the funniest is with my friend @ PERSON1 because we would have a lot of fun when we are with her, she is the glue that held us together. I think when we're all together we always laugh at every scent of the day. No matter what we did or didn't do, we were laughing all the time. This one, we would say "like" all the time in one of our classes that we would have all this time in fifth because we were the only two girls there with four boys and a teacher, so @ PERSON1 and I would do almost anything in this class because we wouldn't do anything that would get us into trouble.

                   @ DATE2 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 was a hot day, and @ CAPS3 and I were on our way to my family reunion, at @ ORGANIZATION1, @ LOCATION2. Our car was packed, and along with my mom, grandma, cousin, and us two daughters, @ CAPS2 got really hot. @ CAPS2 was for the @ NUM1 of @ DATE1, in @ DATE3. I swear I thought we were all gonna die in that car! We had the air conditioning on, but @ CAPS2 didn't help much, I was in the middle of my cousin, @ CAPS4 and @ CAPS3. We finally got to a rest area and we all stumbled out of the car. @ CAPS3 wanted to go for a drink, so I followed. I'm pretty sure we're getting some weird stares from everyone around us at this point. I was in my @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS6 and @ CAPS3 was in @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9. @ CAPS2 felt that @ CAPS2 had taken @ NUM2 minutes to walk to the water cooler. @ CAPS2 was really so hot. I opened a cliff bar, while @ CAPS3 had a drink. It was then that I heard her scream. Of course, I burst out laughing, even though I didn't know what had happened. @ CAPS3 turned around and that laughter turned into hysterical screams. The mouth of the fountain had been turned towards you when you were drinking, so @ CAPS3 was soaked. I said sarcastically, "@ CAPS12, you won't be hot for a while, will you ?" We both laughed and she chased after me, trying to soak me. Sometimes all you can do is laugh together. Later that day when we finally reached the family reunion, they had a swimming pool. She tried to push me inside, but I took her with me. Everyone was laughing at the time. I don't think I've ever laughed so much as I did the last @ DATE2. They were good times.

                                    Laughter @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 For the @ ORGANIZATION1 is a very important thing in life, personally I couldn't live without laughing in my life I honestly couldn't. I wouldn't be me if I didn't have a laugh in my life. All relationships should have laughter involved in one way or another, what would a relationship be without laughing ! Laughter is a beautiful thing, when I laugh I enjoy life in my own way and my worries disappear instantly and much like I feel "carefree". Laughter makes us healthy both physically and mentally. Throughout my life, there have been many times that laughter has been implicated in many relationships. But let me tell you about a time when laughter was really impactful and was and still is a big part of my relationship with my dad. I have always been very close to my father, you could even say that I am a little daddy's girl. Laughter played a very important role in my relationship with my father. He has always found his place in our relationship. The moments of laughter @ CAPS1 are what I enjoy and cherish so much that every time I think about it I can't help but smile. I remember when I was little if I needed a laugh @ CAPS1 my dad was the one to call. The laughter got louder over the years, I can't remember a time my dad and I had a time where laughter was not involved. We always used to watch these @ CAPS3 shows together that we almost always laughed so hard it was impossible to get through the show without making a noise or missing something because we were both laughing so hard. the whole family, sometimes we didn't even know why we were laughing, it would just happen. I can just hear those sweet laughs between my dad and me, oh how those @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 nights were what I had been looking forward to, I knew I would be laughing with my dad soon and tears of joy would flow down our faces. I was looking forward to that sweet sound of laughter, it was almost impossible to walk through the whole show without laughing, oh what a @ CAPS1 time that was. Since my dad moved to @ LOCATION1 we haven't had those lovely laughs that I miss so much, but I can still cherish them in my heart. These moments of laughter were the best moments I have ever had with my father, from being a little girl until now almost an adult. I don't know if my dad and I would be this close today if we hadn't had so many laughs throughout our lives. Whenever I'm sad or miss my dad, I go back to those times when we were full of laughter and listen to his laughter playing in my head. I never knew how important laughter would be to me. I am happy that laughter has played such an important role in my life. Laughter is such an important part of life / relationships as it brings joy and happiness. Laughter is the kind of thing that, no matter what, should always be a part of any relationship. I think laughter is healthy for our body, for example if you are sad, depressed or just don't have a day @ CAPS1, a laugh @ CAPS1 will change that and make you feel a lot better, like my father and me. Laughter also makes relationships last longer, the reason I'm so close to my dad, best friend, mom, boyfriend, sisters etc. is because of the laughter himself- same. If laughter wasn't involved in my relationships, I couldn't bear to be sad all the time, everyone needs a little laughter at some point in their life. My dad is the reason I laugh so much, he showed me how laughing is such a powerful but yet so simple thing. I never thought that laughter would have such an important place in my life until my dad showed me how precious it is. Where I would be today without laughing, I really have no idea. My dad taught me how laughter can change your attitude about things and how important it is to have laughter in your relationship. If laughter weren't involved in any relationship, the world would be very boring without laughing or smiling, can you imagine not laughing at all ! I certainly can't imagine life without laughing. If my relationship with my father didn't have a laugh, we wouldn't actually be the same people we are today, we would be completely different people and we wouldn't be as close as we are today. What do you think of laughter? Has laughter ever played an important role in any of your relationships?

                                        Laughter: Laughter from @ CAPS1 to @ CAPS2, they say, is the best medicine. We all know that every relationship needs a plentiful dose of medication from time to time. @ CAPS3 younger brother, @ PERSON1 and I have a pretty good relationship. Sometimes we argue, other times we can get along like we're the best friends in the world. When we went to the same school together I would do my best to say hello to @ CAPS3 brother. Almost every time I got shut down and ignored, by @ CAPS3's own brother. @ PERSON1 is going to be a freshman next year and I will be a junior so we will go to high school together. One evening, at the table, the @ CAPS3 family was discussing what the change would be with the two children from high school. I brought up the fact that @ PERSON1 never says hello or even waves to me and I didn't really like it. Some how we started talking about how he would be known as @ LOCATION1's brother because I'm so awesome. Next thing I know @ PERSON1 blurted out, "Yeah, @ LOCATION1, I'm going to embarrass you because I'm so ugly." @ CAPS3's parents and I looked at each other and immediately started laughing and couldn't stop ! When we had half regained our composure, we asked @ PERSON1 why he would say something like that about himself. @ PERSON1 said he didn't really know why he said that, he thought it would be funny. Yes, @ PERSON1, that was it !! It was @ CAPS3's turn to pray for dinner that night. As much and as hard as I tried to pull myself together long enough to pray, I couldn't. Every time I thought I had pulled myself together, I would start having fun again. After a while, @ CAPS3's parents asked me what was wrong. I replied, "I was going to ask @ CAPS4 to make @ PERSON1 look better so he wouldn't embarrass me." I started laughing so hard that I cried. I couldn't see anything because tears had clouded the vision @ CAPS3. Now after what I said it took me twice as long to control @ CAPS3's laughter. @ CAPS3's parents calmed down before me, so @ CAPS3's mom had to pray because I couldn't contain myself. The whole time mom @ CAPS3 was praying, I had to shake @ CAPS3's hand on @ CAPS3's mouth to keep from laughing. Getting started with @ CAPS3 was so hard that it hurt @ CAPS3's toothache. That night I think the whole @ CAPS3 family received a few spoonfuls of the medicine. Probably enough to last us another week or so. I can't wait to be ' sick ' again and need another dose of medicine !

The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 in @ ORGANIZATION1 is the shortest distance between two people. They express happiness, belonging and they let you forget your worries for a few seconds. Who doesn't like to laugh? I will write a true story in which laughter is an important part. My story will be about myself, who is an exchange student and @ CAPS1 in high school, and how I met my best friend today. It all started the morning of my first day in high school @ CAPS1. I clearly remember how nervous and excited I was. I wasn't able to concentrate on my breakfast because my mind was full of thoughts and questions. What will school look like? And what will the students think of me? I have never been to @ LOCATION1 before and have never been an exchange student. Because of all the worries going through my mind, I didn't even notice that it was already time to leave the house. This moment that I envisioned for months, has finally arrived. My host mom said goodbye and wished me a great day. Now I was totally alone. I walked through high school and went to my first class: @ CAPS3. On the way to the classroom, people stared at me, but no one said a word. Have you ever felt lonely with hundreds of people around you? This is exactly how I felt at the time. My first class went well, as did my second class: @ CAPS4. During @ CAPS4, guys asked me if we had cars at @ LOCATION2. Although this question seemed really stupid to me, I gently answered yes. My next period was drama. I struggled to find the theater hall, but luckily I met a girl on the way who showed me where I needed to go. Her name was @ PERSON1 and she told me she had moved here last year from @ LOCATION3. From the first moment I saw her, she seemed really nice to me. On the way to class, she asked me about the difference between @ LOCATION2 and @ LOCATION1. She also seemed very interested to me. While our drama teacher prepared a scene, we continued to talk. I had the strange feeling of knowing her forever. All the nervousness I had at the start of the day was gone. I told him some guys asked me if we had cars at @ LOCATION2. She replied that they asked her the exact same question, but about @ LOCATION3. Suddenly she laughed. It was a happy, friendly laugh and soon I started to laugh too. It didn't seem awkward to be sitting next to a girl I had just met and we were laughing so hard. I knew this moment, this laugh was special. I felt so happy and I belonged and it let me forget all the fear and doubt for a few seconds. What I didn't know at the time was that she would become my best friend. It was my true story, in which laughter was an important part. It's not easy being @ CAPS1 at school, especially if you are an exchange student. My story has shown that laughter is able to change people's thoughts and shorten the distance between two people. In my case, it made me feel more comfortable and confident which was the start of a great relationship, as well as a great time at @ LOCATION1. The end

 The high school years are tough for many teens if you don't have a friend who's always willing to put a smile on your face during the worst of times. I had a great friend named @ PERSON1. She had this special power to make me laugh no matter what. We stopped being friends towards the end of our second year. It was our two faults for letting our friendship grow closer. It wasn't like we had made enemies. But we didn't end our friendship so kindly and peacefully. On @ DATE1 entering my junior year, I forgot why we weren't friends anymore. If I couldn't remember why we weren't friends anymore, then obviously that was a stupid thing to argue about. But things are said. It would therefore be much more difficult to make up. I really didn't want to be the first to apologize. I did the worst thing to our friendship and left it that way. It was the first day of my freshman year. I hadn't seen any sign of @ PERSON1 anywhere. This worried me because I thought maybe she had moved and I didn't have a chance to say goodbye to her. Lunch was over and that's when I mostly saw everyone. And there was still no sign of her anywhere. As I walked to my last lesson of the day, I was seated in the front row. Once installed I entered @ LOCATION1. I had a smirk on my face knowing she still hadn't moved. She turned to look at me seriously. For a second, I forgot we weren't friends. My face got serious too. It was great to know that she still lived here, but horrible to know that we still hadn't made peace with each other. But I didn't want to be the first to apologize, because I knew she would think I was the one to blame. So leaving it like that was all I could think of. The semester went by very quickly. Seeing her every day in class made it even harder for me to be in there. I lost a really good friend because of something I can't even remember. I noticed that she made new friends and grew with our friendship. She still hung out occasionally with my group of friends. When we both joined the cheerleaders we saw each other more after school. But we still haven't spoken. I really felt like she was acting like I had never been a part of her life. At first, I hated her for treating me that way. But I also had to take responsibility for what I had done to him. One night I felt so beside myself. I really needed a friend who could just let me forget about my problems and make me smile. The only person that came to mind was @ PERSON1. I felt very lonely at the time. So I decided to write him an email. It would have been better to help him face to face but I know I would have chickened out if I had faced him face to face. So an email was better than nothing. I told him I was wrong about a lot of things that came out of my mouth. I told him how much I missed his friendship and how much I missed his gifts. I woke up the next morning feeling a terrible stomach ache. I didn't want to go to school but did it anyway. During lunch hour, I sat in my usual place in the lobby. @ PERSON1 came out of nowhere and sat down next to me. She smiled and said "remember when you stumbled in class @ NUM1 ?" I couldn't help but laugh when she said that. Tears were streaming down my face from the strength with which I laughed. I felt like it had been ages since I had laughed so hard. We talked a lot about our summers and the news that happened in our lives. We laughed more than we talked. I really found my funny best friends again. And the laughs can start again.

Laughter is an important part of life. It's important in my life because it makes me happy. I'm going to tell a true story of why laughter is so important to me and my life. The days when I would be sad because of some stressful and unhappy things that were going on in my life right now. My friend @ CAPS1 would come to my house to cheer me up. He would cheer me up by making me laugh a lot. The main ways he could make me laugh, when he noticed I'm sad were, by randomly tickling me a lot, telling me a funny joke or asking me a silly question and having me play a video game or two. , that I was very uncomfortable. The first way he can make me laugh is by tickling me. When he came, we would sit down and talk about random things that went through our minds. He would notice that I was getting sad at some point and he would say that if I wasn't happy he would tickle me so that I would laugh to cheer me up. I didn't really want to cheer myself up to make me laugh, to cheer me up. So he started to tickle me a lot. I'm ticklish pretty much everywhere so I was laughing hysterically and it was so much fun. After he finally stopped tickling me, I would laugh again. If I were to get sad again, he would keep tickling me until he was sure I was happy. I would be happy that day because of the laughter. Another day he spent hanging out with me. Maybe I didn't have such a good day. We were watching a movie and eating popcorn or watching TV, and he noticed that I wasn't really happy. So he was trying to make me laugh to cheer me up. He made me laugh by telling me a silly joke or asking me a random weird question. Funny little things like that will always make me laugh. Throughout the day or while watching the movie. He would say something like it is so beautiful outside. When it really wasn't, he just made me laugh. Or, something in the movie would happen and he would say it would never be possible in real life. He would just make me laugh to cheer me up. Besides tickling me and saying something funny to make me laugh, he also made me play a video game to clear my mind. When he got home he said we should play some fun video games for something to do because it was raining outside. At first he was showing me how good he was at one of his favorite video games, like Assassins @ CAPS2. Then he said I should try to play it. I wasn't very good but it was fun. I'm not used to the controls of a @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 so I wouldn't know how to do certain things, and he would laugh at me because it was supposed to be easy. When I couldn't do something, I would laugh and give him the control because I couldn't do it and he could. It would make me laugh because I couldn't do something simple like run against a wall in the game, so, I had to give it to him to do and it was funny for us. Being bad at video games is funny to me and it makes me laugh. In turn, that would make me happy, which is important. In conclusion, my friend @ CAPS1 tickling me a lot, saying something weird and random, silly and funny or, making me play video games that I was bad at and had to do to me, that would make me laugh. By making me laugh, a lot, it made me very happy. Laughter is a very important part of my life and of this story. This is important because if I didn't laugh as much as he does to me, I wouldn't be so happy. If I'm not happy, that's not a good thing. Because being happy is a very important part of any life and relationship. Most of the ways I can be happy are by laughing. So this story shows that laughter is a very important part of my life. You could also say it's important in my relationship with @ CAPS1. He makes me laugh which makes me happy. It is very important for me.

Laughter is the shortest distance between two people For a long time, I never thought I could be happy. I felt like every time I tried someone was always there to say "@ CAPS1 no she's about to be happy. Better take it all away from her." It's @ CAPS2 always happened ; I was the one who was dumped, cheated or lost a best friend. I would sometimes stay awake at night and wish that one day someone would listen, care and understand. I didn't think this wish would come true, but somehow he did. @ PERSON2 was the kind of guy you could tell anything to. He would listen and care as if it was his problem too. It was @ CAPS2 that attracted me the most to him. His sense of knowing when things were wrong and trying to improve them. The thing I loved most about him was the way he could make me happy when I was feeling so depressed. He didn't live near me, he never came and we barely knew each other but he made me smile better than anyone I have known in years. I guess I never believed that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It didn't take long for this to be proven wrong. A freshman year and I was lost. I just wanted to be popular, make friends and have a good boyfriend. My main focus that led me through each period of class was the boys. It wasn't the best thing I could focus on, but hey, they did. I still remember sitting in my math class when a tall, dark-haired boy was sitting in the front row. @ PERSON2 was her name, and suddenly I got hooked. I did @ CAPS2 which most girls do when they see a cute guy. I made a fool of myself. I was so sure I would never have a chance with him until I got his number. The story continues from there we went out together and dumped. For a while we didn't speak. But it was @ CAPS2 that brought us even closer. Later, we became best friends, and that's how I became happy. My boyfriend was not a good boyfriend at all. It took me a while to realize this because I was fascinated by his ability to make me feel important. I assumed I wasn't important when I called @ PERSON2, crying the night he cheated on me. Usually when you ask a boy to help you with your problems he doesn't know @ CAPS2 to say. But when I spoke to @ PERSON2 it looked like he was going through the same thing. His take on the dilemma helped me overcome it. I spoke to him the longest that night, explaining to him how I was feeling. To my surprise, he actually cared and listened. After hours and hours of chatting, @ PERSON2 and I finally realized that we need to be related in some way. He and I have so much in common. We both went through the same scenarios and we both help each other overcome them. Once after a dance, @ PERSON2 called me saying, "I cried, when @ PERSON1 left tonight." I helped him. Later that month, he thought she was cheating on him. I helped him. I remember calling him one night and he woke up just to hear me tell him that I had quit the dance team. People tell me not to get too attached to him, but I can't help it. We don't even have to be in the same room and he makes me smile. All the things we have been through make me laugh. He makes me laugh. He's not the class clown or the comedian, but it's just something about how he can be himself and not be embarrassed that @ CAPS2 makes him so fun to be around. We @ MONTH1 fight and don't get along sometimes, but I know he will always be there when I need him. Sometimes I sit down and think back to the start of the year. When I was shy, calm and miserable. I think about how @ PERSON2 is the most caring guy, but you wouldn't notice it unless you knew him. I think, “@ CAPS2 if I've never met @ PERSON2” and wonder if I would be the same person I am today. I now recognize that I have changed so much in these few months. Maybe it's from @ PERSON2, or maybe it's just me. But I'm pretty sure the laughter had something to do with it. It reunited me with @ PERSON2 at the start and it keeps us together even now. To be complete strangers and now best friends. It may be true; laughter is the shortest distance between two people.

Sometimes @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 to @ CAPS4, I would glance nervously around as my mom drove up to the weird and unfamiliar building that was supposed to be @ CAPS6 new @ ORGANIZATION2. "@ CAPS5 around! We can come back another time ... or @ CAPS2 won't come back at all." @ CAPS6's mother laughed and continued to look for a parking space. I collapsed in @ CAPS6's seat, disheartened and alone. @ DATE1 was the first day of the second year of @ CAPS6 in @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION2, and I had to spend it in a new @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION2 ; @ ORGANIZATION1. The transfer to a new @ ORGANIZATION2 would not have been so bad @ CAPS3 if I had not been forced to leave the @ ORGANIZATION2 that I loved, the @ ORGANIZATION2 in which I had friends, the @ ORGANIZATION2 which answered to the selective needs and wants of @ CAPS6. I dreaded this day and only wished I could come home and sleep away from this nightmare. @ CAPS6's mom practically had to drag me from our minivan to the doors of @ ORGANIZATION2 because @ CAPS6's body and mind struggled to run in the opposite direction. There was a massive crowd of students swarming around the hall, which would later be known as " the commons ". @ CAPS6 mom introduced me to the responsible woman, @ PERSON3, then said goodbye and walked back to the car. I was nauseous and @ CAPS6's heart was pounding as I glanced at @ CAPS6's new peers. I didn't even see a single familiar or friendly face. Not being an outgoing person was a struggle for me, especially when faced with a new environment like this @ ORGANIZATION2. The truth was, I didn't even want to make friends. I @ CAPS2 wanted to go back to @ ORGANIZATION2; @ CAPS6 @ ORGANIZATION2. As the day wore on, @ CAPS6's mood only got worse. No one had even tried to be nice to me, and I wasn't really trying either. While the students were on a field trip to the @ CAPS9 campus down the street, I ran into a girl who looked @ CAPS2 as uncomfortable as I did. @ CAPS14 had long, straight blonde hair, brown eyes and a pierced nose. We started to walk together, our steps synchronized with each other, although no words were exchanged. We both felt more comfortable next to each other, rather than alone. On campus @ CAPS9, I decided to ditch the shy @ CAPS6 protective shell, and asked him where @ CAPS14 came from. "@ LOCATION1", replied @ CAPS14. “The @ CAPS6 family moved in here the last @ DATE2, so I was homeschooled until the end of the year,” @ CAPS14 informed me, his voice tinged with nervousness. We continued to chat as our group toured the building. I still hadn't learned his name because I couldn't read the writing on his badge and I was too embarrassed to ask what it was. Luckily @ CAPS14 started talking about his name. "@ CAPS6's parents named me @ PERSON1 because @ CAPS6 mom is @ CAPS13, and I guess @ CAPS14 really liked that name." @ CAPS14 shrugged and rolled her eyes. @ CAPS14 told me I could call him by his nickname, @ PERSON2, because @ CAPS14 didn't like people talking to him using his full name. After our visit, all student groups returned to @ ORGANIZATION2, as we were going to @ CAPS3 for a pizza party for lunch. As @ PERSON2 and I sat in the corner munching on our food, we studied the children around us. "@ CAPS15 ... This is going to be the worst year ever," I said darkly. We looked at each other pitifully for a while, measuring the difficult times that lay ahead. Then, simultaneously, we both sketched a smile. The next thing I knew, we were laughing hysterically, our bodies rocking back and forth with each breath that managed to escape our lips. Sometimes when life throws me lemons, instead of making lemonade, I curl @ CAPS6's lips at the thought of their acidity, and @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 to @ CAPS4. While the laughter didn't automatically make @ CAPS6 new @ ORGANIZATION2 a fun and welcoming place, it made @ CAPS2 a bit more bearable. Laughter is truly the best medicine, no matter what the illness or problem, and it can make two strangers friends almost immediately.

 I once learned something very valuable in school. I didn't learn it in a classroom, or even train it from a book. I learned this lesson in a hallway near the copy room. A @ MONTH1 be asked to ask, what kind of lesson could you possibly learn in a room ? All I'm going to tell you is, this isn't the one I'll soon forget. In order to fully understand what exactly I was doing walking the halls and learning lessons, you will need a bit of context. I was in my third period class; who was the leadership at the time. Leadership is not really your mainstream class from an outsider's perspective. Kids running around school like loose mice @ MONTH1 make an appearance of impropriety, but an appearance is all it was. We weren't doing anything wrong, it's just that most of the time you had to leave the classroom to do what needed to be done that day. Leadership came directly before my favorite class of the day, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. I just hated this class. I was in @ CAPS1 classes since I was in kindergarten at @ ORGANIZATION1. I was in second grade at the time and this language had bothered me for ten years. It wasn't that I was bad or anything because I really wasn't. I just had a strong contempt for the @ CAPS1 class. The teacher always gave me a hard time, probably because I had a big mouth and tend to talk a lot. She was that kind of person who had the @ CAPS10 posture and straddled the rules. The type of person you might see wielding a garden stick like a lethal weapon. In leading this specific class time, the teacher took an especially long time to explain what we were supposed to do that day. He did that sometimes, he was famous for his long breath. It could take the entire @ NUM1 minute class period just talking about an assignment that would have taken ten minutes to complete. That day, however, we were not serving a mission. At least not what a normal person would consider your typical assignment. Another girl in the class, @ CAPS5; and I were working on a special project. We must have picked up something very important from my car. We waited until the professor finished speaking and we asked if we could go, he said yes. We walked through the double doors to the classroom and entered the main hallway, then made our way to the parking lot. As we walked, we passed the office doors, hall @ CAPS6 and the library. Just as we were about to walk through the copy room door, I saw @ PERSON2. @ PERSON2 was in my class @ CAPS1 Two the year before and thought I would say hello to him. I did, then asked if he was taking @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 that year. He answered with no. I told him, "@ CAPS10 thing, because @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 sucks !" I didn't know it at the time, but I would be eating those words by truck in no time. Not five seconds after I said this to @ PERSON2, @ CAPS5 was pulling on my shirt sleeve trying to get me out of the building. I told him to calm down and that it was rude to interrupt people when they were talking. After saying goodbye to @ PERSON2, @ CAPS5 rushed me to the door and she burst out laughing. I was taken aback by her sudden burst of laughter and asked her what she was laughing at. That's when @ LOCATION1, my @ CAPS1 teacher, stuck his head out the door and said to me with his heavy accent : "@ PERSON1, I heard you don't like my class ! " I must have been as red as a tomato. I was just standing there with the dumbest look on my face. The kind of look that jumps across your face when you want to have a rewind button for your mouth. I looked over my right shoulder just in time to see @ CAPS5 breathless because she was laughing so hard. I redirected my attention to @ LOCATION1, she was just standing there with an angry face covering the laughter that was trying to break through. I was there, less than ten paces from my car, and for once I had nothing to say. The lesson I learned that day was never to curse an alligator before crossing the river. Or at least make sure the alligator isn't in the next room. Especially if the alligator is teaching your next class.

 Laughter is an element of @ CAPS1 Laughter is an important part of @ CAPS1, without laughter @ CAPS1 would not be what it is today. Laughter is actually a part of why I'm in my relationship with my boyfriend right now. I also believe that "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" someone once said. Laughter also breaks the ice with people, whether it's when they're mad, sad, or when they meet the person. Laughter can also bring two people together. Here is a true story of how laughter is a part of @ CAPS1. One day, while I was with my best friend @ PERSON1, we met his cousin @ PERSON2 and his friend's @ PERSON3 @ CAPS2. @ PERSON2 and I started talking and hanging out a lot that night. I'm a very shy person but he kept making me laugh. It's not a love story but he made me laugh broke the wall I had erected because I was shy and very uncomfortable. The more we laughed together, the more I felt close to him and at ease with him. Finally, we started dating. Today too we are still together and we have a very strong relationship because of the laughter, without the laughter @ PERSON2 and I wouldn't be as close as we are now. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." I believe because laughing gives you that sense of security, like the feeling that it's okay to be yourself with strangers. Laughing makes you feel warm and invites you to have fun. Makes you feel like you are connected to that person right now. It doesn't make you uncomfortable when you use laughter for the right reason, like breaking the ice with someone or just meeting someone who can bring them together. Break the ice while laughing. Meeting someone for the first time can be very uncomfortable for some people who are chatting and laughing might do this trick to make them feel less shy and start talking again. When I first meet people I'm very shy until someone makes me laugh, so I'm very comfortable. Sometimes making people laugh when they are sad or angry can also bring you closer to someone. But laughter can always take you away from someone. When I was upset about breaking up with my ex-fiancé for the first time after a year and a half, no one for a day or two could make me happy. My best friend @ PERSON1 took me to the state fair, being on the rides and laughing with her, brought her and I got closer so I wasn't angry anymore. She broke that anger and hurt me just laughing. A big part of @ CAPS1 is laughter, there is no doubt about it. From people's perspective, @ MONTH1's laughter is not a part of @ CAPS1 for them, but for me it is. Without the feeling of security in laughing with @ PERSON2, we wouldn't be as close as we are now. No laughs @ PERSON1 and I wouldn't feel as warm and comfortable as we do together. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." Someone once said. @ CAPS1 would be very different without that element of laughter.

 My friend @ ORGANIZATION2 received a random phone call in @ TIME1. They were his friends from high school, there were three of them. The odd thing is that they haven't spoken much since high school. Surprised, @ ORGANIZATION2 asked what was going on and how they were doing: assuming they were in jail or something in that area. Instead, the friends responded and told him how they were doing, then told @ ORGANIZATION2 that they wanted to take a road trip. @ ORGANIZATION2 thought "why the hell are you telling me about this" then said cool. what do you need from me The friend responded by saying that he needed @ ORGANIZATION2 to plan the trip as they didn't have computers and they couldn't read maps. at the end of the phone call @ ORGANIZATION2 finally said he would help out and plan the trip. Then he asked the friend if he would like to take this trip. The friend replied that I don't know if I want to see a professional baseball game and @ ORGANIZATION1 was landing, I would love to go. A week and a half later, @ ORGANIZATION2 called their friends back to let them know about the plans. Proudly, he says after his hard work planning for them. it's a ten day trip for you guys from @ LOCATION1 then down to @ LOCATION2's @ ORGANIZATION1 and down and back, watch (watch) a game of all five pro baseball teams at @ LOCATION2, then go at six flags another amusement park like @ ORGANIZATION1. Friends replied what do you mean guys? You come with us. @ ORGANIZATION2 was super surprised and told them you haven't spoken to me for about five years and then you randomly want to go on a trip with me, he said looking a little confused. Friends replied that we need your car and we can't drive and again we can't read maps. Thinking about the situation, @ ORGANIZATION2 finally gave in and told them yes but then gave conditions. He divided the tasks for his friends so that he didn't get stuck with all the work. For example, he gave one of the guys the task of finding hotels and lodgings, another of finding gas stations, and the other friend had to find all the restaurants where they were going to eat. The trip had begun and for @ ORGANIZATION2 the vacation was must-have and surprisingly fun and relaxing. At least for now. Everything was going and working as expected, they got up and happily watched four of the five baseball games and had a great time, then @ ORGANIZATION1 land went above and beyond, and even six flags came out and brought @ ORGANIZATION2 and his friends again to feel like they were in the good old days of high school. The only small concern with the trouble was that one of the friends had fallen behind in his task of finding hotels and lodgings for everyone. the friend spent the nights they stayed with relatives or friends lived most of the time. but for hotels, it was a bit like the last minuet. The last few days before leaving, the plans were still unfolding accordingly. They just had another event. the Giants baseball game, then stay with her old high school buddy who moved to @ LOCATION2. make sure they would have accommodation for sure @ ORGANIZATION2 asked the friend in charge of finding accommodation. The friend replayed with a "No, I haven't spoken to him yet. I'll call him later." This made @ ORGANIZATION2 a little uncomfortable so he told his friend not to call him now. to bring bad news he was back at @ LOCATION1. @ ORGANIZATION2 thought I knew this trip was too good to be true. The @ TIME1 of the baseball game, things rushed. @ ORGANIZATION2 and his friends had to leave very early because the traffic in @ LOCATION2 is so random and bad. During this time @ ORGANIZATION2 was able to use the restroom and two hours after the start of the journey to the game of giants things started to take a turn for the worse. @ ORGANIZATION2 must have gone wrong. But his friends backed him up saying the traffic is good, we have to keep going. that @ ORGANIZATION2 listened and continued. Then the traffic stopped. @ ORGANIZATION2 was going to fit in his pants! so he pulled back and drove to the side of the freeway, surprised he didn't get stopped, he miraculously ended up at the giants stadium, then he saw a portable jar that he pulled over and ran to it, it was locked. @ ORGANIZATION2 looked around and saw another one. he leaves as fast as he can for that. And yes it was finally open @ ORGANIZATION2 thought him ecstatically! he got inside but looking at the urinal, he realizes he hasn't arrived fast enough and, embarrassingly, he got into his pants.

 Laughter can change any situation. It can be used to break the awkward silence after a bad joke, to recall a good memory, or to clear your head and create a sense of calm. In @ DATE1's opinion, laughter is a form of communication. I discovered this through the rude of @ DATE1 through many different situations. Many experiences took place with people who spoke different languages or young children with whom I was able to connect through laughter. One of @ DATE1's laughing experiences was with the many different exchange students the @ DATE1 family hosted. We have received exchange students from @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION3 and @ LOCATION4. Most of them have fairly well broken @ CAPS1s, but some words have proven difficult to describe and translate. @ DATE1 Preferred exchange students were @ PERSON1, a student from @ LOCATION3. She lives in the northern part of @ LOCATION3, in the country @ LOCATION2. In country @ LOCATION2, they speak @ CAPS2 and @ LOCATION2 and the culture is slightly different from the rest of @ LOCATION3. What made @ PERSON1 so enjoyable was his playful personality, his empathy, and his ability to really make anyone in the room laugh. I believe this incredible ability of her is one of the reasons the summers I spend with her are some of the happiest memories of @ DATE1. @ PERSON1 could turn any activity into a light experience. I did chores with her like washing the dishes, a chore I usually didn't enjoy, and all the time we made fun of the most outrageous things. Together we laughed until tears flowed from our eyes and we felt the urge to go to the bathroom. Once @ PERSON1, @ DATE1 best friend @ PERSON2, and I spent a whole day lying on the grass in a park doing silly sketches and telling funny stories, laughing until our bellies hit us. hurt. Between bursts of laughter, @ PERSON1 would exclaim "@ CAPS3 you have to stop this or I will surely explode, I have to go to the bathroom every ten minutes!" @ CAPS4, she looks like we were looking at each other and rolling on the floor again laughing. When I went to visit @ PERSON1 at @ LOCATION3, we had many similar situations of outrageous and uncontrollable laughter. One day we went to parliament @ LOCATION2 with our families, @ PERSON1, her sister @ CAPS5, @ DATE1 sister @ PERSON3, and I couldn't help but act awkwardly and crack up. We walked around the building calm and serious, unable to be silent or stoic, laughing at each other uncontrollably, making faces and dancing, unable to contain our glee. I don't know @ PERSON1 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS4 @ DATE1 friends back home, but I think I will always feel a deeper connection with her than most people because with her I feel the free ability to laugh at everything and everything. I have heard a lot of different facts about laughter; if you laugh before an exam you will do better, times of laughter are more important in your memories, and a person who laughs every day is more likely to feel less stressed and have a happier @ DATE1, but the reason i love to laugh is that it makes me feel really fantastic.

What's a @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 laugh ? Would me and @ PERSON1 be best friends @ CAPS2 laughing ? It would be a negative point. I honestly think laughter is the biggest part of @ CAPS1. What kind of @ CAPS1 are two friends who never laugh ? If there are people in the world who aren't laughing, I bet they don't have any friends, at least real friends. I'm sorry for these people. I can't even imagine life @ CAPS2 laughing. All of my friends and I laugh all the time. Especially with me and @ PERSON1. When @ PERSON1 and I are around each other, @ CAPS5 usually laughs nonstop. @ PERSON1 and I laugh about almost everything. We have so many jokes inside that it's not even funny (well for me and her @ CAPS5), like "a @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 upstairs !" or "Jean, Jean, Jean, Jean". See things there that people wouldn't find funny, but every time one of us lets one of our stupid inner jokes slip out, we start laughing until our eyes are gone. If I imagine @ PERSON1 and I never laughing, then that would be the worst @ CAPS1. I even hate to think of us never laughing. @ CAPS5 looks awful. If me and @ PERSON1 never laughed, we probably wouldn't be friends. I'm so happy to have so many laughs in my life. I don't know what I would do @ CAPS2 @ CAPS5.

@ ORGANIZATION1 you are thinking about a relationship, what are you thinking about? Do you think laughter is an important part in a relationship? Laughter means laughter sounds indicating mirth or derision. Lots of people have had a great or bad relationship before, they knew @ ORGANIZATION1 laughing with each other, they enjoyed each other's fun. First of all @ ORGANIZATION1 a couple laughs, they like being together so it makes them want to spend more time together. Laughing on its own allows the couple to look better beyond each other. The couple would get a better connection. So they could understand each other. eg @ ORGANIZATION1 a couple just had a great time, they would like to continue sharing the wonderful beyond with each other. Another reason why laughter is a part of a relationship, it will eventually allow the couple to have a stronger relationship because you would have a wonderful connection with each other so they would be able to understand each other. Therefore, things between them would be successful in a stronger and better relationship. The next time you're in a relationship, think about how much laughter is an element, and how fun, connection, more time with each other, and a stronger relationship are all good for laughter. So the next time you're laughing with your boyfriend or girlfriend, think about what you benefit from just laughing with each other.

 It has been said that "Laughter is the spark of the soul". I fully agree with this statement. Laughter can do wonders for the soul; it really does light a spark. And once that spark has been ignited, beware, it will burn like wild fire. As the fire burns it is unleashed throughout the body. It is first that uncontrollable smile that hurts your cheeks, then the butterflies that float wonderfully in your stomach, then comes the tingling sensation deep in your toes, and finally, the tears of joy flow from your eyes. . Have you had these feelings before? That '@ CAPS5 the rampage I'm talking about ; let the fire burn. Laughter is an amazing thing - it can turn an awkward or embarrassing situation into a much more relaxed one. Unfortunately, in my story about laughter, it wasn't me laughing ... about three weeks ago, while my sister was doing gymnastics, my mom, my best friend @ CAPS1, and I went to surrender visit my grandparents and see how the work on our new barn was progressing. After spending some time with them, it was time to pick up my sister, @ CAPS2. My grandpa very kindly offered to go get her, but then I mentioned that @ CAPS1 and I could go and do it. As we drove around town with my grandfathers @ LOCATION1 everything looked fine; just another ordinary day. After arriving at the gymnastics center, we went inside and waited for @ PERSON1 to finish. However, as we were going out my sister said she was hungry and asked me to stop at @ ORGANIZATION1. I walked over to the control panel and ordered his food. The lady then asked me to drive to the first window to pay. After doing as she asked, I received my change, started the truck and started to move forward - when suddenly I heard a loud crackle ! My heart sank as I looked in my rearview mirror. I was not far enough away and hit the side of the building. Now before I continue I just want you to know that I have been driving since I was about seven years old and generally a very good driver. But hey, this first accident happens to all of us, doesn't it ? Well, back to my story, as I drove home to my grandparents it took everything I had to not cry. After we got home, @ CAPS1 and I ran into the house and got a cup of hot water, soap, toothbrushes and a @ CAPS5.O. @ CAPS5. buffer. We scrubbed and scrubbed until all of the red paint on the side of the building was gone. The dent didn't look that bad once the paint was gone and the truck turned white again. I was absolutely terrified to tell my grandparents about the truck ! After waiting about an hour, I finally had the courage to tell them what had happened. My grandfather put on his shoes and we went outside to see the damage. As I started to cry because I felt so bad, my grandpa laughed and reminded me that it was just a truck and it could be fixed. The fact that he just laughed really made the situation a lot less stressful. Laughter brings people together and creates bonds that will last a lifetime. So, it doesn't matter if you laugh at something that makes you happy, or a situation that maybe just isn't that good, let the fire burn.

 School had just graduated. It was @ DATE2 before my senior year. We had planned this camping trip for @ DATE1 a few weeks. We were so excited about it that's all we could talk about. It would be the first camping trip we had taken without our parents. It would be the best four days of our lives. The sand, the beach, friends, quads, no parents; how could it get better than that? We invited as many people as we could think of. The more people there were, the more fun it would be. @ ORGANIZATION1 and I did all the shopping the day before. We've got plenty of yummy stuff to do. After coming home from shopping we had to load all the bikes into the toy tug. We each took two bikes, and we took @ ORGANIZATION1's boyfriend's bikes so he could just ride after work. We stayed up most of the night, trying to find the perfect outfits to wear each day. It was going to be a beautiful weekend at the coast, we could already tell. It was in the middle of @ DATE3, the sun was shining and the weather was nice outside. The next morning we got up and rechecked everything to make sure we had the most important things like flags, helmets, clothes and that sort of thing. Then it was off to fill up with gasoline and finally head for the coast! Once on the road, the music was blaring and the windows were down, as always. The trip there seemed to take forever because we were so excited to get there. When we finally got there there was a really cute guy setting up his tent at one of our camp sites. I asked @ ORGANIZATION1 who he was and @ CAPS2 told me he was @ CAPS1's best friend (her boyfriend), @ PERSON1. We parked the toy hauler and got out to unload and he came to help us. The second I laid my eyes on him, I knew he had to be mine. Within an hour, we unloaded and installed everything. By that time, many more people had shown up. We helped everyone unpack and set up all of their things so we could take a tour. Our first trip to the sand was absolutely perfect. It was hot enough to ride in a t-shirt. We did not stay outside for long, however. People started to get hungry so we returned to the camp, made dinner and sat around the fire. There were probably about 20 of us sitting around the fire, talking about everything from the stars in the sky to the sand on the ground. Every time I looked up I noticed that @ PERSON1 was looking at me. He was just smiling and looking away like it was nothing at all. As usual @ ORGANIZATION1 started telling us about a funny incident that happened to him on @ DATE1 (@ CAPS2 was such a klutz.) We all started laughing as @ CAPS2 showed us his bruises falling into stairs. @ PERSON1 and I closed our eyes. Later that night @ PERSON1 asked me if I wanted to go for a walk. We hiked all the way on the sand trail to the dunes and to the top of a giant dune called @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. When we got to the top, we just sat there, looking at the stars, talking. We realized we had a lot in common. We liked to do all of the same things, and we had the ability to make each other laugh. Laughter is really the shortest distance between two people. If you can make someone laugh, that means a lot. No one has ever been able to make me laugh like he does. I didn't know that laughing could bring two people together like it did one night in the dunes.

  It all started on the playground @ CAPS9 me, my friend @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON2 were just sitting and we saw these two girls approaching and it was these girls from school @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS1. We didn't know who it was at first so we just sat cool like I noticed it was them @ CAPS9 they got closer. They ran and said "hey guys wanna go on an adventure in the woods" "sure why not" we all said "we have nothing better to do so we walked what looked like @ NUM1 miles @ CAPS9 it was only @ NUM2 feet from the playing field, it felt like a long way back and forth I was lazy at the time. @ CAPS9 we walked into the @ CAPS2 there was a lot of bushes and trees that we thought we could make a fort with bushes and relax and eat donuts from @ ORGANIZATION1 there, but what we didn't know was that there was something alive in this @ CAPS2 we weren't aware of. As I sat on the edge of the creek I saw a brownish figure walking deep in the woods. adventure to find what was alive there. @ CAPS9 we started walking all i could see was trees and bushes say i heard @ PERSON1 say " There is something over there by the big tree with vines, so we approached the tree cautiously, not knowing what was going to happen. We stood behind a small fallen log that had been there for a while. As we were looking at the big tree and the huge hollow hole that was in the side, we heard a big snarling nose from inside the tree, I got up from behind the tree and I went on. check it out but before I could take a step @ PERSON1 grabbed my jacket and told her she looked dangerous "okay" I said in disappointment because I really wanna go see what there was in this tree. We started coming back to let the others turn out they've been looking for us for over @ NUM3 minutes "sorry" we both said "but you have to check this out @ CAPS7 so little", I said angrily . "@ CAPS5 what is it" @ PERSON3 said "I don't know but it looks big and scary and mean" said @ PERSON1 "" oh daaanngg "@ PERSON2 said" I think that I was going to die if we got back there "@ CAPS1 complained." @ CAPS7 it's going to be okay "I said then we all looked at each other okay everyone said in a scared voice . the animal or whatever is in it "I said @ CAPS9 we were walking over there to see the animal @ CAPS1 didn't want to go see the animal anymore so we had a bit of a fight and then we went all agreed that @ PERSON2 and @ CAPS1 stay up the hill for a bit and we'll come back running if something goes wrong. of this tree. I couldn't wait anymore it was starting to take forever so i got up and said "let's go see what's in that tree" "I'm with you so ts @ NUM4 said. We're walking around the tree keeping our distance @ CAPS9 we heard that growling sound again, we backed up a bit but continued, we got a little closer @ CAPS9 I saw something coming out of the tree. It was a huge mountain rope that we ran as fast as we could up the hill. I looked back trying to follow the sound of @ LOCATION1's screams but @ CAPS9 looked up, c 'was really @ PERSON3 I couldn't help but laugh @ CAPS9 we had @ PERSON2 and @ CAPS1 I kept laughing until @ ORGANIZATION1. As soon as we entered @ ORGANIZATION1 we were all exhausted out of breath, especially me because I couldn't help but laugh about @ PERSON3 and the way I thought q he was @ PERSON1 because he was screaming like a girl. "@ CAPS13 up" he said "it wasn't me, it was @ PERSON1" even though @ PERSON1 was running next to me during the gap. We walked into @ ORGANIZATION1 a bit more and there was a big box of donuts right next to the deli and we ran over there and got two boxes that had a total of @ NUM5 donuts then we had a big gallon of soda and cooled in @ ORGANIZATION1 and ate the hole in @ NUM6 minutes. I will always remember this day as one of the craziest days of my life.

  One stormy winter night my girlfriend and I wanted to go to dinner so we did. When we arrived the restaurant was almost full so we quickly got a table. While waiting to eat, we started talking about our friends and having a good time. I then said something really mean about someone she knew and didn't know. She got really mad and rushed out of the place, leaving me alone. I finally got up and went home after paying to charge for food that I hadn't eaten. The next time I mourned, I got up and started cleaning the house, mowing the garden, and doing all my chores. She came to my house and apologized for what she did, so I apologized for saying something mean about a friend of her. I told her that I will call her after my housework is done and that I will go out for lunch. Finally, I finished the chores, took a shower and got dressed. I then called her and told her to meet me at the restaurant of her choice. About an hour later, she shows up and finds me waiting at the table furthest from the door. Then she sat down and asked me if I was going to be mean again. I said that I will be kind and considerate today and that I will not be mean. I then started to tell him a funny memory. She laughed and told me one. This lasted until we left. Until she broke up with me for my friend, laughter was one thing that held us together.

 Laughter is said to be the medicine of happiness. Those who laugh often end up having an overall better life. They are in a better mood throughout @ DATE1 and affect the people around them with their upbeat mood. Many strong friendships involve frequent laughter. I am fortunate to have friends who keep making me laugh at each other. This was one time we all laughed intensely over at my late home at @ TIME1. My freshmen in high school were my second year overall in public school because my parents previously taught me at home. I just made friendships with four other people earlier this year. They were my friends @ PERSON4, @ PERSON1, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON3. Neither of us have been to the other's yet, so I suggested being the first to all get an @ DATE1. We weren't sure exactly what we wanted to do with me yet, but we knew that with our creativity we could find anything to entertain us. As they arrived one by one, we watched football on @ CAPS1 until the whole gang were home. After the last person, @ PERSON2, came to my house, we all went out to find something to do. We are all soccer players, so we decided to play soccer in the backyard. Unfortunately, we were all linemen except @ PERSON4. The problem was, we had what is called "lineman's hands" which meant that we couldn't catch a soccer ball because of having hard hands. It created quite a spectacle of a bunch of linemen trying to be wide receivers. We ended up not finishing the game because it was so funny. Later at @ TIME1 we all decide to collect the immense amount of garbage around my property and like most boys our age we started to fight with them. This battle continued for most of @ TIME1 and people were touched in the funniest way. After we all got tired of running around, we decided to make a horror movie with my mom's video camera. That's when the most laughs of the @ TIME1 ensemble came. We all sat down to craft a plot for our movie and continued to twist it in different ways to come to an agreement on what to base ourselves on. We decided to make the movie look like it came out of "@ CAPS2-field", a movie about aliens invading Earth, but we replaced the aliens with a psychopath chasing us. At the start of the movie, everything seemed to follow the script perfectly. Sadly, we found out that we couldn't act at all when the first serious scene happened. @ PERSON4 was supposed to be on the ground with a gash in the side when we found it, but when we filmed this scene @ PERSON4, who was supposedly oblivious, couldn't keep a straight face when we got it find. Since he had a goofy smile when we came to pick him up and with @ PERSON3's awkward line "The window is open, @ PERSON2 is gone" we all started laughing out loud. After we calmed down we went to film the next scene where we wake up @ PERSON4 and try to find out what happened. @ PERSON4 said “I'm really hurt! I think I need an ambulance”, then @ PERSON1 replied “@ CAPS3 it won't happen!”. This line that @ PERSON1 said was not in the script and was just too funny to keep and as a result we all started laughing again. We tried to remake the scene, but when I said "@ CAPS4 are you laughing" we all burst out laughing uncontrollably. Later in the movie, the last guys alive were @ PERSON1, @ PERSON3 and me. The psychopath was locked out in total darkness. Randomly @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON2 walk past the camera when they weren't supposed to. It made us laugh again because of the way the little fat one was running. After all the scenes were over and the movie was over, we all returned to my living room, scared that we had been out in the dark for so long making a horror movie. My sister comes home at random without our realizing it. She looks through the locked front door silently in a very creepy way until we all noticed her. We all jumped about ten feet in the air because we were extremely scared. After we got settled in we all joined in the laughs again as we looked back and saw how stupid we were. In conclusion, the laughs that unfolded throughout @ TIME1 brought us closer as friends. Every time we meet at my house we watch this tape and we remember the good times and laugh until we cry. The benefit of laughter in my life was being able to bond with now my best friends. My life is truly blessed in this way. TO FINISH

 Brilliant blue waves of morning light rolled over the hilltops as the awake sun began to rise to its daily position. The cool, cool air arose the sleeping birds. Soon the twilight turned into a vibrant morning where the birds chatted with their melodious song. Gentle breezes swept over the trees, making the leaves dance. The green grass seemed to flow like an ocean as the cracked gravestones stood still; just like ships anchored at sea. Anyone @ MONTH1 will agree that this particular cemetery scene presents a stupendous feeling; however, when one sees the stoic man standing in front of the silent gravestone, the onlooker's heart fills with empathy and despair. Motionless, young @ PERSON1 stood in front of the gravestone. The gentle but rapid breeze began to accelerate to become a strong wind. @ PERSON1's watery eyes and wet face began to dry. While windy weather was not uncommon for @ PERSON2, @ LOCATION1, a long lost memory interrupted @ PERSON1's thought for some unknown reason. For a moment, her mind returned to sixteen years ago, when @ CAPS5 was still alive. His eyes closed as the wind started to calm down. He could almost hear her voice. "@ CAPS1, I would like you to meet someone," @ CAPS5 yelled from upstairs. It was @ DATE1, and six-year-old @ PERSON1 zealously climbed the stairs. Breathing quickly, he made it to the top of the creaky stairs and walked over to his parents' bedroom. "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 ?" he asked as he began to turn the cold brass doorknob. He opened the door just in the air and glanced around the room. Her blue eyes twinkled with curiosity. He watched as the midwife glided gracefully up to her mother's bedside to support her head with another pillow. His attention then turned to his father who was sitting on the edge of the bed, cradling a small bundle of pink blankets. “@ CAPS4 hello to your new little sister,” @ PERSON1's mom said. Still holding the brass knob, @ PERSON1 pushed open the door with the palm of his left hand. The door moaned as @ PERSON1 began to place the tips of his light-up sneakers @ CAPS7 on the roan colored rug in his parents' bedroom. Carefully and cautiously, he walked over to the foot of his parents' bed where his father was sitting. He stood in front of his father with wide eyes. “@ CAPS5 was born less than an hour ago,” his father said. @ PERSON1 then looked at the pile of pink blankets. He nervously stretched out his sweaty hand and gently pinched the top layer of the blankets to uncover his little sister's face. Everything was silent except the wind outside. Inch by inch, he slowly began to remove the top cover; but, before @ PERSON1 could even complete this task, the newborn baby let out a surprising exhalation. @ PERSON1 stepped back and slammed against the bedroom door. Her father jumped at @ PERSON1's reaction, but was careful not to wake the baby. @ PERSON1 felt like his heart was about to leap out of his chest. Eyes wide and breathless, he turned to his mother. To @ PERSON1's surprise, he found his mom quite amused. The corners of his moth began to curl up and a slight laugh escaped. Soon both his parents were immersed in hypnotic laughter; their bodies were shaking in rhythm. @ PERSON1 started to relax and smiled at this mother. "Are you a little afraid of @ CAPS6 @ CAPS5?" @ CAPS5 asked. Her father rang, I think he did! ”The three of them laughed for the next five minutes as the midwife just smiled and the baby fell asleep in her father's strong arms. @ PERSON1 could feel the irresistible essence of reality rushing back to him ; just as the wind blew through his brown hair. He missed her. He cried for her. He wished @ CAPS5 could win the fierce battle waged between the human body and cancer ; but, @ CAPS5 did not. Now @ CAPS5 was gone. He would never see his mother again on @ LOCATION2. Although this memory did bring him sadness, it didn failed to push @ PERSON1 into depression. distance between two people. " @ CAPS7 then, @ PERSON1 suddenly realized how incredibly close he was to his precious mother. He had eight years of memories made with his mother and many of those memories involved laughter. @ PERSON1 nodded to the sun as tears of joy rolled down her face. Now he understood the fact that love never depends on time. Of course, he only knew his mother for a small chapter of his life; However, the memories created and the laughs shared continue to engulf @ PERSON1 with the love of his mother. In my mind, @ PERSON1 is classified as a superior individual. As I am his only full sister, he never fails to share with me his past memories with our mother. I love her and miss her, but I know that I will see her again one day; and when I do, we will be bound by joy and laughter.

I was selling cookie dough for school and going to this older guy's house. I reviewed the fundraising business for my school and he said he wasn't interested. After that we started talking, I started to make him laugh and finally he said "you make me laugh, I like that, I will buy some". I think laughter played a key role in him buying the cookie dough.

 We all understand the benefits of laughter. I believe that laughter is an important part of the life that everyone should live. The moment I remember most laughing and having fun is when my family and I went to @ ORGANIZATION1 at @ LOCATION3. It all started with @ DATE1. We were opening our presents when my @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 told me and my siblings that they had one last present for us, but it was a surprise ; to know what it was, we had to find it. So they told us as a clue, that this was a place where we slept. As soon as they told us I knew exactly where to look for our rooms. So we climbed the stairs to our rooms and looked around. To our delight, sitting on our bedside tables where there are four packages full of info on @ ORGANIZATION1. We were so excited and happy. My little sister said it was the best @ DATE1 gift ever. We ran down the stairs, kissed @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 and told them they were the best @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 ever. What made it even better was that we were going to miss school. Then we found out that the trip was scheduled for the month of @ DATE2. So we had to wait four months. These four months have been the longest of my life. Four months later, it was finally time to go. We must have woken up around @ NUM1 am because our plane was supposed to take off at @ TIME1. Before leaving our house, I asked my @ CAPS1 if I could bring my @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 with me so that I wouldn't get bored on the plane. She told me I could, only if I shared it with my little brother. Once we finally left the house, I started to feel like I had butterflies in my stomach. Guess it was because something fun and exciting was about to happen to me. When we got to the airport it was @ NUM2 so we had about an hour and fifty-five minutes before the plane left. Fortunately, I had my @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. As my brother was only six he gets bored easily so I let him play my @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 until we had to board. When it was finally time to board, one of my sisters had to use the bathroom. My @ CAPS1 ended up taking it away while my @ CAPS2 stayed with us and boarded the plane. My other sister didn't like that my @ CAPS1 wasn't on the plane with us yet. So my @ CAPS2 told me to keep my brother and sister in their place while he went to pick up my @ CAPS1 and sister. Five minutes later, they all came back, and just in time too. The plane had just finished refueling and we were on our way to the runway. One of my favorite times in an airplane is when it hurtles down the runway at incredible speed. And when we finally hit the speed we needed to be, we launched into the air and my stomach felt like it was in the open. My little brother holds my hand so tight his little knuckles turn white. It made me feel like he was scared so I told him to just think of it as a really fast car going over a bump. It seemed to help a lot because he started laughing when the plane left the ground. He said it was fun and he wanted to start over. I reminded her that once we got to @ ORGANIZATION1 we would be doing whatever rides we wanted. Three hours later, we arrived at @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION3. Once we got off the plane, we went to collect our bags at baggage claim. My @ CAPS2 went to see when the next @ CAPS11 @ CAPS12 was due. As it was coming back, the @ CAPS12 was just arriving on the road. The @ CAPS12 was blue with the characters @ CAPS11. The driver showed us a lot of cool things and places. The @ CAPS15 we were in was called The @ CAPS14 @ CAPS15. There was a huge pool shaped like a guitar. Once settled in we went to @ LOCATION1. It was really fun because my sisters and I got all the autographs and character photos from @ CAPS11. My favorite was @ CAPS17 because it reminds me of myself. We must have been in the park for about three hours when we got hungry. So we left and returned to @ CAPS15. After dinner we went down to the pool to swim. Seemed to be more fun than @ ORGANIZATION1 because during the week we were there we spent more time laughing and swimming by the pool than @ LOCATION1. It was the best time of my life and I owe it to my parents. I love them a lot. Thank you.

 My best friend and I have been friends for the third year. We shared a lot of laughs, memories and tears, but to this day we are still closer than ever. One of the biggest reasons we've been able to stay friends for so long is that we make each other laugh. We joke and turn any boring moment into a good one. It's the story of how our relationship started and some of the reasons we're still best friends. It started in the third year. I was walking alone in the playground when she asked me to play with her, having nothing else to do, I agreed. We played all recess, and it eventually became a regular thing for us to spend recess together. The first time she invited me over to her house, I was a little nervous. I was worried it would be awkward, or that we weren't having a good time. When we got to her house after school, we went to her room, played some video games, and then had a snack. We took our crackers to his room, sat down on the floor and started to eat. Out of nowhere, we just looked at each other and started laughing like crazy. They weren't giggles either, we laughed so hard we had tears in our eyes. From that day forward, we hung out as often as we could. A few years went by, we hung out more often and declared ourselves best friends. When the fifth year arrived, we were glued to the hip. His father was our teacher, so he already knew how close we both were. We never really got to sit next to each other, but we still managed to talk a lot. One day at recess we were joking and she said your butt was so big you were going to break a chair. These days it doesn't sound so funny, but in fifth grade it was hilarious. When we got inside we played this math game I asked the wrong question so I slumped in my chair of course it broke. The other kids who heard what she said laughed, but no one really laughed as much as we did. The fifth year was also when the boys started to take the stage. During @ DATE1's hiatus she really liked this guy, and when he said he didn't like her she was completely broken. That night she came to tell me about it, but we never ended up talking about it at all. Instead, we watched funny movies and I was doing things on purpose to make her laugh. Even though we were already very close, that night brought us even closer. At the end of the fifth year, we had a little graduation ceremony. Towards the end, they presented a slideshow of everyone in the fifth grade class. One of the photos was of @ PERSON1 and I in mud masks, we were both embarrassed, but we also laughed because we had a lot of fun that night, and we wondered how the photo is arrival on the slide show. After the ceremony, @ PERSON1 and I threw a party. We shared a lot of laughs and it made us even closer, even though we had made new friends that night our bond was unbreakable. College was a whole new experience. New friends, different classes and more drama. I hate to say it, but we have drifted apart during those three years. We didn't have the same classes and we both met new people, but every time I went to her house, or every time we hung out together, we laughed until wept and gasped. A lot happened, our various friends fought, some of them moved, but our ability to make each other laugh kept us together through thick and thin. Towards the end of our college life, we got closer again and things got back to about normal. Today @ PERSON1 and I are as close as in fifth grade if not closer. When we are together, we not only make each other laugh, but we also make others laugh. We're together almost every weekend, and we @ MONTH1 don't do much, but we always end up laughing like crazy. By making cheers, we also spend even more time together. Other things in our relationship are important too, like trust, loyalty, and kindness, but laughter is what kept us together through everything we've been through. Laughter is also the reason we became friends in the first place and I'm happy to call her my best friend. Without her my life would be very boring and I hope we will remain friends for the rest of our lives. Laughter keeps people together and strengthens relationships. It was an example of how it has helped me and my best friend to become friends and stay friends through everything life has thrown at us.

Don't talk, laugh. I love @ CAPS11 little brother. We are @ NUM1 years old @ CAPS7 in the way we act, @ CAPS3 would think we are twins. @ CAPS7 @ CAPS5 no matter how close we are we are still siblings and we are still fighting. Usually it's just small fights that we get over in seconds, @ CAPS7 this one was one @ CAPS4 couldn't back down. I beat him in tennis @ CAPS1. @ CAPS14 was a hot afternoon, and me and my brother @ CAPS11 had just come home from school. We usually relax a bit before doing our homework by challenging each other by playing @ CAPS1. "@ CAPS3 cheated." @ CAPS4 said firmly. "@ CAPS5 I didn't !" I retaliated. I could tell @ CAPS4 was getting really upset about this, @ CAPS7 I didn't care. I wasn't going to let him win this one. "@ CAPS6 yes @ CAPS3 did it. @ CAPS3 still does ! @ CAPS14 is not fair." "@ CAPS7, I didn't do it this time." @ CAPS4 was telling the truth. There are times I cheat by distracting him during a game, @ CAPS7 I won fair and square. "@ CAPS3 is just angry because @ CAPS3 lost. Pick yourself up and take @ CAPS14 like a man." That's all I had to say to get him to throw down his controller and make him cry up the stairs. "@ CAPS6 ! What did @ CAPS3 do to your brother ?" @ CAPS11 mom shouted. "@ CAPS4 beat him to one game and now @ CAPS4 is crazy." I knew @ CAPS4 would do that. @ CAPS17 and report me to @ CAPS11 mom hoping she would save him and get me in trouble. "@ CAPS13 @ CAPS14 is just a game. @ CAPS3 can't win every time." "@ CAPS14 just isn't fair !" said @ CAPS4 before slamming her bedroom door. Sweet, sweet victory. I like when I win. @ CAPS14 makes me feel superior. @ CAPS7 sure that little guilt feeling over making your little brother cry came over me so I went to see @ CAPS17 and I apologize. "@ CAPS13 ?" I knocked on his door. "I'm sorry I made @ CAPS3 cry. @ CAPS14 is just a game. @ CAPS3 wins and @ CAPS3 loses. Don't be mad." I offered the most sincere apology I could think of at the moment. "@ CAPS17 missing. I don't want to talk to @ CAPS3." @ CAPS17 far ?! I walked up to the top to tell him that I was sorry for something I didn't even have to apologize for, and @ CAPS4 tells me to @ CAPS17 away ? Oh @ CAPS5. @ CAPS5. @ CAPS5. @ CAPS5. After dealing with what just happened, all that could come out of @ CAPS11's mouth was "@ CAPS19.". And I left. The rest of the day passed. We passed each other several times without even recognizing each other. I couldn't believe that @ CAPS4 was so upset with @ CAPS14. @ CAPS14 was probably one of the longest times that @ CAPS4 didn't speak to me by choice. I started to feel really bad, even sad that @ CAPS4 wasn't talking to me. I decided to try talking to him again. The only problem was that @ CAPS4 was downstairs playing @ CAPS1 again and I was upstairs this time. I walked out of the room @ CAPS11 and started to walk down the stairs. @ CAPS4 could hear me coming, so @ CAPS4 turned down @ CAPS21's volume. "@ CAPS13 listen. Is @ CAPS3 really not going to talk to me during a game I-" @ CAPS23 ! All of a sudden, I was slipping down the stairs. "@ CAPS24 !" @ CAPS4 was laughing at me ! I landed at the bottom of the stairs and started laughing too. We were both laughing! That's all we needed to get the conversation going again. Just a little laugh.

                             laughing why do people have such a hard time trying to laugh? Is Laughter a Healthy Thing You Should Have in Your Health Chart? Here are some questions you might ask yourself . But when you've thought to yourself, and maybe you've thought about it, how much you and your family all laugh together at the table or in the family room until you hear laughter coming out of your mouth. No matter what you are laughing at, it could be one of your family members telling a joke or even a funny show or funny commercial. it doesn't matter as long as you laugh. In my opinion, laughter is an important part of your life. If you aren't laughing you must be a very serious person or you might even think the world is a very boring place. some how i can't really imagine a person never laughing in their life. Some examples of people not really laughing anymore are probably someone who has lost a loved one or just has no one to tell jokes with, in my opinion you must have someone to share things with or who you tell jokes when you're in a really bad mood. I always remembered my mom telling my little brother to calm down when we were talking at the family table over dinner one day. One day I went to school and went to health class, it was weird because the teacher was talking about how we should share things at the table and have moments of laughter. So when I got home, I told my mother everything the teacher had taught us during the health class. She said okay and we tried it. It was a really good experience, we were all laughing and telling jokes all the time and since then we have been telling jokes at the family table. It really gives you energy sometimes, but at the same time, if you laugh too much, your stomach will eventually hurt. Like i told you in the first paragraph you can laugh in different ways eg if you look at a really good idea would be @ PERSON1 which always shows i crack up sometimes my mom thinks i am crazy. Or ever the family @ CAPS1 its such a great show to watch when your really in a bad mood. Another way to make someone laugh is to tell jokes. but one way you are really going to make someone laugh is by tickling which always works, you can never make someone laugh. Eather always has someone doing it for you because I know you can't do it yourself, that would be really weird or asking a @ CAPS2 to see who laughs first. It won't always help you solve your problems, but it will make you feel good for a while, it will really make you forget about bad things for a while. I've heard that if you laugh a lot you live longer so I think that helps you with your problems.

During @ DATE1 I decided to join @ ORGANIZATION2, raised a market pig and was determined to sell it to @ LOCATION1. Raising a pig was laborious and tedious work. Without patience, good teachers, and fun, I couldn't have done it. This @ DATE1 I had good experiences and some of them not so good. This was my first time getting involved with @ ORGANIZATION2, also my first time raising a pig. I never thought I would have so many difficult times. One of my awkward but funny moments happened when I was shoveling pork poop with my friend @ ORGANIZATION1. It was also the first time that @ ORGANIZATION1 got involved with @ ORGANIZATION2 and raised a pig. @ ORGANIZATION1 and I were just trying to hurry up and finish our work so we could go home and have a shower. Turns out I was in too much of a hurry. My boots got stuck in the mud and poo which made me lose my balance, I tried to use the shovel to catch up but it was too late. I was covered in pork droppings and mud from head to toe, I had fallen into it. @ ORGANIZATION1 and I looked at each other for what seemed like two minutes, but only about six seconds, and then we burst out laughing. Once we had our laughter under control, she helped me up and we went to get our agriculture teacher @ PERSON1. When @ PERSON1 saw my old blue pants now brown he couldn't help but laugh at me. He took out his camera and took pictures of me which are very embarrassing but make others and myself smile. After all the jokes, laughs and pictures, @ PERSON1 donated some old clothes to wear on my return home. I had to roll down the window because the car smelled pretty bad. When I got home, I walked straight to the shower. It was an experience that I will never forget. If I hadn't had friends around me, I don't think I would have thought of the experience as something positive and fun. Because @ PERSON1 and @ ORGANIZATION1 were there to help me out and laugh with me, I had some pretty funny memories of this @ DATE1 raising a pig. Without the laughter it could have been a little negative, I could have been angry, or embarrassed, or sad. Laughter is an important part of a healthy, positive lifestyle.

 Some people say that laughter is the best medicine. I totally agree with these people because I believe that any funny situation where there is laughter can put anyone in a better mood. Taking the time to laugh at something or at yourself is something everyone should do. Having a good time with friends and family and laughing with them really is something to be thankful for. I have had several laughter-filled situations. @ CAPS2 I am thankful for. My two best friends, @ PERSON2 @ NUM1, and I, let's just say there's hardly any time we're together without a laugh. So many times we made fun of ourselves and each other, I lost count. It's so amazing to have these two great friends to laugh with. There are so many times that we made fun of each other that I don't even know where to start. We were all at @ ORGANIZATION1 once and we were playing hide and seek in his backyard. It was my turn to be the researcher. I got out of the house after counting to @ NUM2. While searching the yard, I finally found everyone except @ PERSON2. As I wondered if the court was looking for her, the others started to help me look for her. We could hear his laughter coming from somewhere, but we couldn't tell where. She started talking to us saying things like "@ CAPS1 here !" or "@ CAPS2 way !". After being frustrated and abandoned, she finally revealed herself ... on the roof of her house! We all laughed so hard, not even knowing how she got there in the first place. Another time we had gone to pizza for my birthday party @ NUM3. We went to the arcade with the money we had ready to play a few games. We told ourselves to avoid the claw machine because we knew we wouldn't want to stop and waste all of our money. But of course @ ORGANIZATION2 only had to try it once. Then we knew we were using all of our money to try and win @ CAPS2 game. We ended up each winning something, screaming, clapping and laughing hysterically like kindergarten kids. We had also played the racing car game @ CAPS2 at least ten times and we were running out of games. So to relieve our boredom we started playing the racing car game by driving with our feet instead of our hands. It was a very fun time. I couldn't tell all these stories. It would take hours, days, even weeks. But I can tell you that laughter is definitely a part of our everyday life. I consider myself a very lucky person to have such great friends that laughter is such a common thing for us. Few are lucky enough to have this opportunity. A little laugh can do a lot of good. So next time you see someone who looks like they need a friend or might just have a good laugh, talk to them, try to be their friend, make them laugh. The result will be its own reward. Believe me.

 I believe that laughter and joy are key elements that bring families and friends together. Being able to be in the company of those who make you laugh is greatly appreciated. Sometimes just sitting around telling old stories or playing board games can hurt your guts because you laughed so much. These days a lot of people have gotten so caught up in their life and sometimes forget to take a moment and laugh. I feel sorry for these people because they miss the joy and the enlightenment that they could share with the people around them. Family vacations are always chaotic, at least in my family, but they always turn out to be a memorable experience in one way or another. Every winter our family gets together and goes to @ ORGANIZATION1 to stay in our cabin. A long weekend full of great food, excursions to the mountains, snowball battles and family games, this is a great environment to have a laugh. Every year, we offer great family games such as @ LOCATION2, @ CAPS1 and @ LOCATION1. My family and I tend to be very competitive people and the volume of the room the game is played in tends to skyrocket. The whole house is filled with laughter and fun arguments over things like "how the hell is that a picture of a sock!" or "It's not fair, you know the real definition !" I love these moments because they are memories that you can hold onto forever. Laughter is part of happiness, and happiness should be part of life. Spending time with those who make you laugh is the ones that are worth it. People wiser than I say "life is short". I'm starting to realize that this statement is true. If life is short, then this time should be spent in the best possible way; moments filled with laughter.

 My boyfriend and I had planned to go to the @ NUM1 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 show they hosted at @ LOCATION1, OR. He asked my mom if she would let me go with him to the fair @ LOCATION1 @ LOCATION1 and surprisingly my mom said "yes you can go", I was really excited because this would be our first @ NUM1 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 together. We thought about what it would be and we laughed because we said "what if we take a turn and fall", but knowing that it wouldn't really happen. The day before @ NUM1 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I prepared all my things for that day. I was really excited and nervous because I've never done such rides, so I probably didn't fall asleep before @ NUM4 in @ TIME1. @ NUM1 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 was a @ DATE1, I didn't want to go to school so my mom let me go to the fair instead of school. I woke up laughing and with a smile on my face from all the things going through my head. I got ready, my boyfriend @ PERSON1, his brother and sister picked me up with my friend around @ TIME3. We drove to the train station @ CAPS9, parked and took our bus ticket. After we got on the @ CAPS9, we sat down and took pictures and made jokes. Since we entered @ CAPS9 it was just laughter. I'm pretty sure the rest of the passengers thought we were crazy. It took us about @ NUM6 minutes to get to the fair, when we got off @ CAPS9. We ran to the gates to get our tickets. But it wasn't @ NUM7 so they weren't open so we had to wait @ NUM8 minutes until they opened the doors. Once we got in this lady was selling a card that had the tokens on, so we bought it and went on a spider ride which didn't look so scary at first, but it moved really fast so I slipped everywhere. @ PERSON1 and his brother were laughing at me and my friend @ ORGANIZATION2 because we were screaming but after a few seconds I stopped screaming and ended up laughing for no reason. After this ride I wasn't really in the mood to scream or look stupid in front of the other people who were at the fair so we didn't ride any for a while until we saw the @ ORGANIZATION3 wheel on which we rode. It was fun, but it was moving a lot, so it reminded me of what @ PERSON1 and I were talking about " how funny it would be if we had a fight ". so I held the post that was in the middle and @ PERSON1 and they started laughing so I let go and started laughing so that they would make weird faces at me. When the ride was over, we got off and went to get something to eat from a tent they had at the fair that sold food, drink and a lot of other stuff. We all bought a big bean and cheese burrito, @ ORGANIZATION1, churros and an elephant's ear. It was so good we wanted to buy more but didn't have enough money. So we bought another elephant ear and I was the only one who ate it all. So they started laughing because they told us "if you could eat two big elephant ears, you could probably eat a whole elephant". I would eat twenty elephant ears "they laughed and laughed so I just laughed with them too. After we finished eating we walked around the fair looking at the other tents they had. There were a tent that spray painted your name or whatever you wanted on the shirt or sweater. But the bad thing was we didn't have enough money for the sweater or the rides so we chose to do all the rides and if we had any money we would go back and buy a sweater. Then we walked past a photo booth where they took a picture of you dressed as if you were a pilgrim. J Thought it was funny so I started laughing and my friends started laughing too because they didn't know what I was laughing at until I told them. Then they started laughing even more. We did the last four rides and it was about @ TIME2 that we needed to go, so we left while waiting for @ CAPS9. As we were waiting for @ CAPS9 two security guys come up on their two horses and I thought it was weird to see horses in town we started to laugh. We got on the @ CAPS9, took some pictures and headed home.

Laughter: A @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 of the variety of emotions expressed by humans, there are emotions that represent different qualities. While frowning @ MONTH1 is associated with discontent, anger, or even confusion, laughter is an action connoted primarily with one emotion - happiness. Although emotions are relative aspects of human nature, actions such as laughter exist to translate an emotion like happiness into physiological expressions that humans are able to understand. Because of this unique quality as an action, laughter is often a key component in relationship development. Over the years, I've discovered that laughter is crucial for three different reasons - laughter doesn't separate, it's an ability that all members of the human race have in common, and what's more, it brings down. personal barriers. In many ways, “ laughter is the shortest distance between two people ” ; the laughter examples are anecdotes from @ CAPS1. Unlike feelings such as jealousy, fury, or grief, happiness is an emotion that tends not to separate. While jealousy, fury, and grief can cause such discontent among people to the point of physically and emotionally separating them from one another, happiness does nothing of the sort. Happiness is conducive to laughter, and because of this, laughter brings people together rather than dispelling them. In addition to its irresistible nature, laughter is also an @ CAPS1 action. Generally speaking, laughter gives humans another point where they are equal; the ability to laugh is a quality that humans share. Even infants, in their states of vulnerable dependence, are able to emit laughter. Laughter is also able to establish starting points for new relationships, since sharing a laugh is akin to establishing commonalities between people. Whether the commonality is a sense of humor, similar experiences, or a surprise, sharing a laugh automatically connects two or more people. In addition, while laughter can start new relationships, it can also solidify them. Often times, as laughter is shared through common experiences, having common experiences for laughing itself symbolizes a relationship between people. Since laughter is primarily about relationships and interactions between people, it is also about building trust. Bonding between one person and another, no matter how weak the connection, requires some form of trust. Laughter is often able to break down emotional barriers because it requires a sense of kinship and companionship. Through laughter, we humans are able to dispel notions of suspicion or anxiety. As stated earlier, laughter establishes commonalities and therefore is an activity that exudes a sense of trust and reliability. This breaking down of emotional barriers is another way that laughter can bring people together. Laughter is an action @ CAPS1 that "personifies" how similar members of the human race are. It is amazing how man is able to discern qualities like reliability and trustworthiness just through the complex, yet basic act of sharing a laugh. Through laughter, people are unconsciously able to form emotional bonds with their fellow human beings and in doing so are able to bring the interaction to an emotional level. Laughter is the real story of human relationships in the world. Not only is laughter the @ CAPS1 language, but the intimate nature of laughter makes it the shortest distance between two people.

 Laughter is a big part of any relationship. In some relationships, laughter doesn't end well, but some do and some don't. I had a relationship where we didn't laugh that much and it ended shortly but I found a girl we laughed with when we needed to make another person happy. The funniest relationship I'm in now with. We have a relationship with a lot of laughs. We can laugh at each other sometimes and we try to keep each of them happy by making them laugh and feel good. That's enough for me and my girlfriend. Now my friends and I can laugh at each other when we do silly things in front of each other. We try to push each other to try silly things so that we can laugh in our life when we don't have girlfriends and when we are bored. when they all get together, it's my friends and girlfriends, and my gf and me. Sometimes we say idiots and we start laughing as loud as when and sometimes we don't know why we are doing it but it's fun when we do. Laughter is one of the best things in any relationship because it brings happiness into our lives. So try to have a little laughter in your life. Thanks for reading this.

 The snow sparkled in the sun like glitter. @ CAPS1 and I rushed to her bedroom window to get a better look. A white blanket covered the floor. Quickly we got into airtight snow suits. She opened the wooden front door and the cool air stung my nose. @ CAPS6, we rushed to any graders paradise @ NUM1. @ CAPS1 and I had both been through difficult times over the past few months. I protected myself from the fact that recently my muscular brown horse was put to death by a huge flash of light and a loud clap of thunder. @ CAPS1 had just learned that his parents were in the process of getting a divorce. Being best friends, we had been through a trail of tears that year, but all was forgotten when our legs hit the cold wet snow. We ran to his garage in a panic to find sleds. As we were running through the house to the back door, we were stopped by @ CAPS1's tanned mom. She refused to let us out until we had breakfast. We swallowed a bowl of the always tasty @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 and gulped down a tall glass of juice. @ CAPS6 we flew out the back door with our sleds. There, the giant hill awaited us. It tilted down to a perfect angle of @ NUM2 degrees with just a few turns. The piles of wood and the thorny blackberry bushes that lined our toboggan run taunted us. As my eyes scanned the snow path, I heard @ CAPS1 scream, "@ CAPS5!" @ CAPS6 I saw her whipping down the slope. I grabbed my red racing sled and took off after her. I approached my first corner. It was spinning to the left like the start of an eight. With ease, I turned around the corner and saw a snapshot of the wood pile that was to my right. I looked up to see the old pond at the bottom of the hill. The sun was shining through the shards of trees surrounding it like moonlight dancing on the ice. With confidence, I approached my second round. I turned sharply around the corner. I looked ahead to see @ CAPS1's bright blue sled reaching the finish line. It was then that my eyes saw the bay horse of his neighbors and all my happiness flew away. As I got lost in my thoughts on @ LOCATION1, I also lost focus. My shoulders hit the snow like it was concrete. My legs got tangled and I could feel my head banging. The sleigh had abandoned me. I rolled down the hill like an avalanche. Finally, the benevolent hands of a mulberry tree reached out to stop me. The thorns stabbed my neck. Carefully, I plucked each thorn from my neck and retreated on foot to the bottom of the hill. By the time I reached my final destination, @ CAPS1 could no longer breathe. Head buried in the snow, his abs hopped up and down to the rhythm of his laughter. She looked up at me, her bright green eyes and rosy cheeks telling me how silly I looked as I hurtled down the hill. She laughed one last time when a giant snot bubble burst from her nostril. She started to crack and I fell to the floor with a burst of laughter. I couldn't look at her anymore. Every time I glanced in her direction it got even funnier. I pushed my head into the snow like she had done earlier. Finally, when we controlled ourselves, we looked at each other. Our mascara was smeared around our eyes and on our cheeks. We either looked like clowns with horrible makeup jobs or weird raccoons. Our laughter began to grow again, but quickly died down. Together we stood up. We spotted my bright red sled at the edge of the frozen pond. “@ CAPS9 like a beautiful hike,” I said. @ CAPS6 we both started our journey through the forest to collect it. When I came down the hill like a meteor, and she shot that ball of snot out of her nose like a rocket, I forgot everything. It was the first time in months that we both felt comfortable with our struggles. Laughter is the greatest connection we have with each other. When I laughed my mind excluded the whole world. On snowy days, we laugh now to remember that cold day of @ DATE2, but that day of @ DATE1, we laughed to forget.

 My friends and I have a relationship that cannot be matched. We do everything together and we always find each other. Laughter is a key part of our relationship. If we weren't laughing with each other, we would most likely be at each other's throats. We do a lot of things that end with giggles, but there was one particular event that happened that didn't seem humorous at first, but by the end of the event it quickly turned humorous. The story begins at @ TIME1 as I arrived at school to leave for a grueling five hour bus ride to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 for a wrestling tournament the next day. I slept for @ TIME1 hours before I was woken up by my trainer who yelled at someone for spilling soda on the bus. We were almost in @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 so I just turned on my @ CAPS5 and listened to music all the way. When we finally got to our @ CAPS13, we were asked to lose weight before we could have dinner. After we finished training, we set off for a long overdue dinner at this point. I was with my best friends, @ CAPS6 and @ CAPS7, both with an appetite as big as mine. We passed a lot of fast food places, but we didn't want an old burger, we wanted the masterpiece called @ ORGANIZATION1. We had heard the rumor that there was an @ ORGANIZATION1 @ CAPS8 establishment somewhere in @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, so we set out on our journey to @ ORGANIZATION1. We drove a good three miles along a freeway and down a few alleys. random we thought were shortcuts. I started to think we should go back and look around the @ CAPS13 more, but against my better judgment, we trudged up to where we thought the wonderful @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 was. We quickly found ourselves in an unknown part of town. We walked as fast as we could to avoid the awkward stares of people outside their homes and people wandering the streets. We tried making jokes to lighten the mood and help ease the pain of realizing we were tragically lost in @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. Stupidly, we all forgot our cell phones at our @ CAPS13, so we had no way to call for help. We started to turn back the way we thought we had come, but all we saw were older, weathered houses and buildings that were completely unknown to us. We were all scared, but we covered our fears in the hope that we wouldn't trigger a panic. We were all guessing it was around nine-thirty, and we had to be back before ten to go to bed. It sent us into a panic more than anything else. Our minds filled with images of our trainer screaming at us with all his might, then running us dying five miles. We started running frantically through the streets and alleys hoping to see a familiar scene. After seeing nothing and running for about ten minutes, we regrouped and continued to walk. The fear that was once masked was now clearly visible on all of our faces. We came across a digital display panel that showed the time and temperature. We only had ten minutes to return to our @ CAPS13 or our fate was sealed. We started running again, praying to get back on time. As we were running we came across the side of a big @ CAPS13. We didn't know the name of the @ CAPS13 we were at, so we decided to ask the person inside if they knew where it could be. The lady at the counter informed us that we were now at @ CAPS13 @ NUM1, but she had just started her shift and didn't know where we could be. As we thanked her and walked through the door, we were greeted with a loud slap on the head. we turned around in shock to see our trainer, all red, pointing his watch. We almost did it, only @ TIME1 minutes late. after being yelled at for a good twenty minutes, he made us up to our room to sleep for the long day ahead. I was about to crawl into my bed when I peeked out the bedroom window and saw what my heart so deeply desired; the wonderful @ ORGANIZATION1. My friends and I immediately burst into hysterical laughter. We got lost looking for the treasure which is @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1, and it turns out the treasure was in our own backyard. We hardly slept that night because of all the wry laughter and thoughts of what had just happened. I never got to sink my teeth into any of these tasty and succulent @ ORGANIZATION1, but we had a very funny and ironic experience that still makes me laugh at this exact moment.

 Folded in @ DATE1, it was around @ DATE2, two of my friends and I were out quad biking laughing and having a good old time. They taught me how to do a wheelie on a quad. Soon after they started teaching me I figured out that what I needed to do was put all my weight on the back of the quad and push the gas so I could crank the quad up. 'before and I was doing it pretty well from there out. Well when we were about to head home a friend of mine thought it would be super cool if we had a pic of one of us in the front of the quad while the person driving was doing a wheelie. To do this, one of us sat in the front of the quad, one of us sat in the back of the quad, and one of us was driving. The first thing we do when we were all in the quad is for the driver to back up in front of the quad (the driver doesn't need to slam on the back of the quad as there is the added weight of the person behind it. 'rear) Which in turn brings up the front part. Then the person in the back jumps up and takes a photo on their phone, then the person driving is supposed to brake and put the quad down. Lucky for me, it was I who decided to sit in the front of the quad while my friend does a wheelie. While he was popping the wheelie, he either backed up very far and hard, or hung it up too long. So I was sitting in the front and he was up in the air for about five seconds and then the scary thing happened. The quad started to lean back so my friend jumped up and tried to hold it so I had time to jump but panicked and froze on the bar I was standing on. Then the whole quad hit me because my friend couldn't hold me back. He slammed me into the ground, all @ NUM1 lbs. of it my shins hit me in the face (I have a hard time bending my head up to my knees, not to mention my shins) and it stretched my back so far that I was lucky to not to have broken it. When he hit me in the ground it felt like my legs took off the quad off of me, but it was really just my friend pushing him. After pushing the quad out of me I was lying there for about @ NUM2 minutes laughing in pain for some reason I can't remember. After I finished screaming and screaming and laughing in pain, I got up and they took me home. When we got back there they handed me an ice pack and told me to go and sit on the sofa, I couldn't bend my back so I could sit down, so I had to turn your back to the sofa and fall on the sofa. . While I was sitting there my back started to hurt a lot so I figured if I lay flat on the floor it wouldn't hurt as much and as I thought it would. So I slept on the floor until morning because that was the only way I could feel comfortable. The next day I woke up with a really big pain, it took me about two minutes to get up from the floor, it hurt so much. shortly after waking up i called my parents and they picked me up from the house i barely got in the truck and my dad and i went home and told the whole story to my parents and mom panicked and thought I was hurting myself extremely so she took me to the doctor's office and he looked at me and said I just had to wait for my back to heal everything alone, then I went home.

 Most people believe that laughter is a basic need for your health, not only physically, but also socially. In a socially tense environment, it is difficult to achieve what is expected of you, but if someone introduces laughter into the environment, it quickly becomes more simplistic and you are able to do what you want. awaits from you. With this in mind, I entered the conference room for the first time since @ PERSON1 had left. @ PERSON1 was the advisor to @ ORGANIZATION1, or what we call @ ORGANIZATION2. @ PERSON1 was the reason why a student from every school in @ LOCATION1 had a say in what @ ORGANIZATION1 did or received regarding the school. She helped us express our opinions and that made her a hero in the eyes of many high school students! Soon @ PERSON1's time as an advisor had expired and she announced her departure from her position. After a few weeks, she had found a new advisor to replace her, @ PERSON2. I am an exception to change, but the other members are not. This particular change was far too much for them; they just wanted things to get back to normal. When I sat down in my usual chair, the room seemed a lot less warm and I quickly felt a sense of unease building up inside. I didn't know who this woman was or what she was going to do; all I knew was that she wasn't @ PERSON1, and she didn't make the @ ORGANIZATION2 members very happy. @ PERSON2 crept into the room with a welcoming spirit about her. She stood at the end of the room and smiled. The rest of the members sank deeper into their chairs, as if protesting his arrival. I told myself that she didn't stand a chance, as I sat a little higher and started to listen to what she had to say. She spoke happily and seemed to laugh after each sentence. Although his posture elicited confidence, his chuckle struck nerves. There was only one way for us, as @ ORGANIZATION2, to do what was necessary. We should see @ PERSON2 as a friend and not as an enemy. Immediately I decided to alleviate the feeling of humidity in the room by launching a name game. It's a fun activity to learn more about people and to help @ PERSON2 remember our names. @ PERSON2 seemed much more relaxed after the game, so we continued the meeting. With each second getting more serious, I suggested that the meeting be done for the week and we spend the rest of the time talking and laughing about what happened that week. It made everyone smile. Time passed and with each passing moment the stress in the room grew lighter and lighter, until the whole room filled with laughter. It was as if @ PERSON1 had never left! Soon the gathering ended and we all went home. On the way out, @ PERSON2 stopped me and told me about her nervousness before the meeting because she wasn't sure if everything was going to be okay. She was grateful that I took the plunge and helped lift the morale of the members. This ultimately led to the acceptance of the change and the effectiveness of @ ORGANIZATION2. At the next meeting, the members were all eager to go back and learn more about @ PERSON2, and were able to focus more fully on the issues at hand. Laughter helped @ ORGANIZATION2 members come to terms with what they couldn't control and ultimately led to our success today. Laughter is above all the key to any success in the social society in which we live today; with laughter everything is possible! Although the laughter was only for this meeting, it made the members more welcoming to the idea of @ PERSON2, and created a lifelong friendship between our advisor and the members of our @ ORGANIZATION2. My relationship with @ PERSON2 wouldn't be as strong as it is today, if I didn't share the opportunity to laugh at @ PERSON2's first @ ORGANIZATION2 meeting.

@ PERSON1 In a mother-daughter relationship, @ CAPS2 needs a laugh. It is so important to have this connection with someone who is so important and close to @ CAPS2. In general @ CAPS2 needs a laugh, it shows how @ CAPS2 expresses himself and makes your character stand out. This fun experience was @ DATE1 of my eighth grade, so I was @ NUM1 or @ NUM2. My family and friends went camping. So, the day before we left, my mother, my brother and I went up to set up the camp. When we got to the campsite we immediately started to set everything up and organize. It was a lot of fun but it was getting dark quickly so we went faster until it was completely over. On the way out we noticed that we had left something in the truck, so my mom stopped the truck and looked at me and asked me : @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 do you want to drive now ? ". Haven't thought twice about it. I jumped out of the truck and ran to the other side. All kinds of excitement was going through my body. When I got to the other side, I jumped straight in the driver's seat, with the biggest smile on my face. My mom would give me all the steps lit before starting the truck. Examples : seat belt, steering wheel, mirrors and seat adjustment. The family vehicle was a lever speeds so I was very nervous. I had no idea how to change gears and when exactly. I used to watch my mom and step dad when they were moving and when, I made humming noises but that obviously didn't help me. The first thing I had to @ CAPS1 was to start the truck because mum turned it off before going out I had to put the clutch in full and make sure it was in neutral. So I started this thing off thinking to myself how cool I probably look right now, the average @ NUM1 year old ego. The go part was the worst! I probably killed the truck about @ NUM4 times before the tires went at a constant speed at which they should go. My mother said: "The fifteenth time is a charm". She probably thought she was funny, but trust me it wasn't a funny time. I replied with a nervous laugh, which probably didn't make me feel any better. So I restarted the truck and started moving. I wasn't going very fast, more like the speed of a turtle but it was fine with me because I had no idea what was going on. The truck was going too slow to go anywhere, so I pushed the throttle a little harder. Go around the trash, going about @ NUM4 miles per hour, still at a slow pace as before. The campground was only about @ NUM6 at @ NUM7 miles. Which seemed to take forever! We arrived at the campsite. I could tell because we had a sign that said @ PERSON1 with an arrow pointing left. So I took that to the left and saw all of our stuff. There was a river behind where our camp was and trees were circling all around us. So it was an enclosed space, except for one side. Where @ CAPS2 could see across the river and there were other people camping on the other side. Which was pretty cool because they had kids my age. My mother pointed at me and told me to go near the tent and the park. For an inexperienced driver, I got anxious and put my foot on the accelerator instead of the pause, so that @ NUM4 mph went to around @ NUM9 in a matter of seconds. We were going so fast that I couldn't really react to what was going on. All I could hear was my brother in the backseat screaming like a little girl finds a spider. My mom grabbed the wheel as fast as she could because we were heading straight for the river and about to pay a quick visit to the folks across the way. Instead of going in that direction, we went to a picnic table and pushed this right into another and landed directly on a third table. We were at least @ NUM10 feet from the ground on the pile of broken tables. I had an adrenaline rush and I'm pretty sure the passengers too. We all got out of the truck and literally pulled over and watched the situation for a good @ NUM11 minutes before we started laughing out loud. We all looked across the river and saw their whole family looking at us and laughing at us. My mom looked at them for a few seconds, then looked at us and said, "@ CAPS2 can all come over later for a fire !" "

 The night has been cool, @ DATE1, not too cold but certainly not the sweltering temperatures that @ DATE2 has brought you. It was the type of weather @ NUM1 degree that would allow you to wear jeans and a t-shirt while still being comfortable. The air tightened my skin as I walked the path to my friends' front door. Above me, I knew the stars were hanging in the sky, but I paid no attention. Inside the house, I knew my two best friends were waiting for my arrival. I also knew there was a potential for them to be mad at me. For what, I did not know. I knew when I left school that day I had a feeling in my gut that told me something was wrong. On my way home, as I increased the distance between them and myself, my stomach turned, causing me to look back. When I did, they were both looking at me with looks I couldn't (or didn't want to) place on their faces. All of this made my heart give occasional hard pounding on my chest from nervousness. Still, I pretended that everything was fine. "As far as I know," I thought to myself, "it might as well be, and I'm overreacting." I knocked on the white painted wooden door and stared at the brown side panel, waiting for a response. My friend @ LOCATION1 answered the door. From somewhere inside I could hear my other friend @ PERSON1 laughing. I knew I had missed something, laughter explained it to me as I stepped inside. There was a feeling of emptiness in my chest. I wanted to know what I had missed. I hated not knowing. A mixture of emotions surged inside my body, making my head a jumble that I couldn't understand. I gently pushed open the door to @ LOCATION1's bedroom with my fingertips. As always, the turquoise walls and the sound of music from radio stations jumped in to greet me. @ PERSON1 was laughing and dancing to the music, but when she saw me she stopped and looked. The moment seemed to stretch and expand in time. I felt my guard go up. If she was crazy, fine. I did nothing wrong and I will maintain my innocence. The moment stretched and stretched to the point that I thought it might snap, then @ CAPS1 hugged me, catching me completely off guard, but filling me with a sense of entitlement, because I knew I hadn't done anything wrong. Everything felt normal for what felt like a second and then @ PERSON1 explained the feeling I had when I walked home from school that day. I was accused of not working on a reading project. The accusation dismayed me and deflated my pride. Instead, a slight anger boiled and I just walked out the door and into the chilly night. I heard my friends calling and following me down the street, but I kept walking. I thought it was out of anger, but @ DATE3 I know it was to do a scene. The footsteps I was listening to behind me suddenly came at a faster pace. I glanced over my shoulder and saw @ PERSON1 running towards me. Against my will, I gave a high-pitched cry and started to run, digging my feet into the concrete sidewalk. I felt the determination run through my veins. I walked home in the dark to make my point. @ PERSON1 caught up with me and tried to take me home but I resisted with all my might. I knew I couldn't get out of his grip, out of sheer stubbornness I planted my butt on the sidewalk and refused to budge. I realized that I had only passed two houses. My friends exchanged glances and took me by the arms and legs and started to carry me towards the house. I caught the anger slipping from my hands. I wanted to stay angry but I couldn't. I started to laugh and any tension that I still felt swarming around me rose and was gone. A smile graced my face from ear to ear and my common sense returned gracefully. They dropped me off in the middle of the road. I looked up and admired the stars, which I had missed before, winking at me from above. The last bursts of laughter still danced in the air and whispered to me that everything was going to be okay.

  I was in grade @ NUM1 ; when it was almost my last day of school so since college years have been the worst years of my life. I thought about my brother's pranks he'd made while in college and one of the funniest pranks was the fire alarm prank. He told me the story all the time and that he had done it several times and that he had gotten away with it too. I know I should at least try it since it was my last year in college and I should just go. well @ NUM2 days before school ended i had a lighter with me and i went to the girls bathroom i noticed there was an alarm on the roof top so i stood on top of the sink and lit the lighter, waved it the round white fire alarm and then once i knew it it went off. My friend was with me just as I thought about it and told her before I did what I was going to do at that time and so she knew what I was going to do. But anyway, back to what happened ... we all went out my friend and i were laughing so hard everyone was looking at us with weird faces but then we told our closest friends this that I had done and they all cracked up, even some lower level kids are talking about it, but that's because they were with us and in the end it wasn't pretty. It was the last period and I was in computer class when my assistant manager picked me up then took me to her room and she asked me if I was the person who had turned off the fire alarm and i was like no then asked me again and i still said no. Eventually she told me that when I was doing what I was doing to make him go; Did I notice if there were people on the stalls at the time? I said no and she told me there were two people inside and one of them had denounced me. So I ended up having big problems being on probation, going to the fire department to apologize for what I had done and how long it took them to do their work on the fires at the school, then I had community service all @ DATE1, and almost couldn't get my promotion with the @ DATE2 class which got me down. I regret that I did what I did since I think about it all now, it was something childish and stupid. For some reason it was my funniest moment of my life and I will always keep it as one of my best @ NUM3 memories and moments of any school year. True story.

My laughter story is going to be a true story about me. This story is about my visit to the doctor. I have always loved playing sports, always will. I have been playing soccer for about @ NUM1 years now and have never been injured except for one practice. It was in the @ NUM2 class. My football team always does a hitting drill once a week. The drill is called truck and trailer. This is where you have @ NUM3 people. Two people in attack and two people in defense. The two people on offense try to score and the two people on defense try to stop them. Of course I'm stuck with the ball and not to mention the worst person on the whole team blocking for me. There was nothing that kid could do on the football field other than keep the bench warm. The two bigger and better hitters were on defense and trying to kill me. I knew it was going to be bad. All I could do was run fast, so I do. My trainer (my dad) turns the ball up and I take off. Soon they catch up to me and make me take off. One went high and the other went low. I touched the ground and stayed on the ground. I hear my teammates start to scream. I thought it was because I had cracked. I thought wrong. I sit down and my knee hurts a bit. I look at it and it looks like rubber. saw a brake like this on tv and youtube. My dad doesn't hesitate to call @ NUM4. The ambulance arrived on the ground @ NUM5 minutes later. They went down to the field and put me on a stretcher. My team was not the only team that used this pitch. About @ NUM5, other teams trained at the same time. All eyes were on me. And on my leg. The other teams didn't know what happened except they had a large ice cream in my private area. All of my friends thought I hurt my man parts. It was embarrassing and funny at the same time. When they all found out it was my leg, they were still laughing at me. I had horrible nicknames for a long time. It was no fun for me and most importantly no fun, but all of my friends found it hilarious.

 Being part of a team doesn't always mean everyone is the best of friends; most of the time the case is that you really don't get along with your team members. This was the case for @ ORGANIZATION2 (@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 of @ LOCATION4) @ CAPS3 of which I am a member. Everything changed after our trip to @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION1 for @ ORGANIZATION2. It was late, twelve members of @ ORGANIZATION3 @ CAPS3 were flocking to @ LOCATION2 to register. Everyone was in their group of friends chatting and looking forward to leaving @ ORGANIZATION4 for our eight day trip. Each group of people didn't always get along with people from other groups (even though we were a team), other people got along with everyone they just had their own close friends. Emotions were very varied that night between the tension of the conflict between people, nervousness and excitement. When our plane finally landed at @ LOCATION1 everyone was completely drained of their energy, but again each split into their own groups and we walked through @ LOCATION1. @ CAPS5 we went through @ LOCATION2 until baggage claim. I started to wonder, "@ CAPS4 are we all together and a team, but we split into different groups within our team and everyone notices it, but it's not cash?" @ CAPS5 I pondered the thought that we headed over to the rental vehicles and loaded everything up and started the day. After a long day of flights and downtown sightseeing @ LOCATION1, we were finally checking in at the hotel. @ CAPS5 we checked in, everyone largely split up with their groups of friends they were cohabiting with to check in in their rooms. Later that evening a few of us who were very close friends went out to hang out by the campfires they had at the hotel we were staying at. @ CAPS5, we sat there talking and laughing, we had a great time. The response I got from everyone was blank stares and a change of topic. The next morning arrived early, we went for lunch and then left for the day to go sightseeing. The first place we went out of the three places we were scheduled to tour that day was @ ORGANIZATION1. At @ ORGANIZATION1 our @ CAPS3 faced our first team building / collage activity. The task that we had to accomplish with each other was difficult at first for everyone, but we all slowly started having fun laughing and working to accomplish what we needed. After we finished the activity, everyone started slowly mingling with people outside their normal group. Later that same day we had a second team building / bonding activity. After completing this activity, there was a feeling of less tension between everyone, even less than after the morning activity. The next day we had two more team building / bonding activities. Every time we had an activity everyone started to connect more and more and each time there was more laughter. We also started spending more of @ CAPS5 on @ CAPS3 and had an even better time of fun and laughing adventures. By the time we were all heading to @ LOCATION2 to get back to @ LOCATION3, everyone was hanging out and there was no conflict. @ CAPS5 the plane took off and I realized that everything had come to me from @ CAPS4 before there were so many conflicts and everyone was split into separate groups. I realized that we had always been in a “ business ” relationship with each other, we never gave each other the chance to laugh, have a good time, connect and let each other get to know each other. Once we took the time to authorize all of these things, we learned who everyone was and befriended.

 They say "laughter is the shortest distance between two people" and I totally agree. You can't be in a relationship or have a friendship with someone and not share a laugh with them. It makes things last between them and makes both partners happy. If there is no laughter in between, that connection will be more difficult to make. I have a best friend and her name is @ CAPS1. We had been best friends since the day we found out we had the same birthday. But for us, that meant we were twin sisters.       

<START>

 

Laughing @ CAPS1 do you remember when you laughed so hard you couldn't breathe ? Or when you started to cry because you were laughing? Whenever I start to laugh, I'm always with my best friend, @ PERSON1. We sometimes even when things are not funny. We laugh about everything. Memories, the future, or even just looking at each other we laugh. You name it, we laughed about it. @ PERSON1 and I have almost always laughed together. Since we first met in seventh grade, and now when I'm in first grade, we still don't stop. She was in my sixth period class and we sat down next to each other. After the first two minutes we spoke, we both knew something good was going to come out of this. So of course from that point on we had to be best friends. I couldn't ask for a better friend than her. She is the best. All of our free time was spent together. Even when we were busy, we were still together. @ PERSON1 and I were together almost every day and every night. We would camp in my backyard or cycle around town. I would go swimming with his family. She would go to @ LOCATION1 with ours. Our two families were going and @ CAPS1 together. We did all kinds of things together. No matter what we always laughed at. Growing up can sometimes be quite difficult for everyone. @ PERSON1 and I were no exception to this. After a bad day, you would know you might find us on the phone talking to us. We could talk for hours and hours about the smallest things. I think we talked for three hours before figuring out what we were going to wear the next day. Never hang up until one of us is told to hang up. I think I can speak for both of us when I say, we hung up with a whole different outlook on life. Even in the worst of our days, we were still laughing. I don't think I could ever grow up without her. @ PERSON1 is such a big part of my life. I would be nothing without her. @ PERSON1 and I @ CAPS1 don't go to the same school anymore, but that still doesn't stop us from laughing. If you've ever had a friend as close to you as @ PERSON1 is to me, you know how nice it is to be close to someone. Just think about the feeling of endless laughter. I firmly believe with all of my being that this is one of the best feelings in the world. @ PERSON1 and I never stop, why should I let anyone else. Without laughing, we wouldn't be as close as we are today. Without laughing, the world wouldn't be as it is today. So find a friend and start laughing. You will see how great it is to laugh with someone. I guarantee it.

 Isn't it funny how a simple laugh can change a senery, a mood like the expression on someone's face, and make a person laugh out of nowhere just because it's outrageous, or the laughter she hears sounds funny. Personally, I've been through all of these stages of what I like to call the contagious circle of laughter. In the past, I have been enlivened by laughing and hearing others laugh. Sometimes I even encouraged others by making them laugh, or laughing at @ CAPS3's own humorless jokes. It feels good to laugh, and at the end of @ CAPS3 long lasting laughs, I feel refreshed that I used all that energy just to make some noise. The friends of @ CAPS3 chose me to be the clown of our group. They all think I'm this hilarious joke (I'm pulling out all these funny jokes). Personally, I don't think I'm that funny, but for some reason just by making them laugh I laugh too. There is this joke that I made up on my own to cheer up @ CAPS3 friend @ LOCATION2. It made everyone laugh on the floor. It's about walking around the store, and seeing the different nationalities of mothers with their babies. The way each mother treats her baby differently. At the end, I tell how the African American mother screams at her baby to be quiet. I'm using a bad word but it's inappropriate for this piece of writing. You got the idea. Anyway, the friends at @ CAPS3 still ask me to tell them this joke to this day, and they still laugh as loud as the first time I told them. There is always someone in your life that you are totally obsessed with laughing, only because you like the way it sounds. Personally, I fell in love with the @ CAPS3 boyfreinds laugh, and that's why he looked so cute to me. The very first time we met he was going after his cousin @ CAPS1 in a park at @ LOCATION1. I was with @ CAPS3 friend @ PERSON1 in the trailer park where his father lived at the time. Malikye (@ CAPS3's boyfriend) had this laugh that made me want to scream “@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4!”, It was so funny. I wanted to run over to him and tickle him to death so he could never stop laughing. Most people who know him hate his laughter and find him obnoxious. He even hates his own laughter. I don't know why but I was addicted to it. It's funny how even hearing someone laugh can make you feel for them. A laugh shows you not only the sound, but also your personality and character. Laughter is of great importance in life. It shows so much about one person and helps so many people. I like to laugh. People should be full of laughter, because without it the world would be a dull and miserable place. I don't know anyone who would like this. Evil @ CAPS5 maybe, but he even has his evil laugh that shows his character ....

 My father is a mean and cold man. The only time he smiles is when he's having a beer or when he's with friends. The last @ DATE1 we were at my grandparents' house for a family barbecue when we got a call from mt @ CAPS3 cousin @ PERSON1 she told us that my @ CAPS1 was in the will of my grand aunts, a few days more early we got a call saying great aunt @ PERSON2 had passed away. My grandfather thought it was going to be in the will, but it wasn't. Two weeks later my @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 and I went to @ LOCATION2 for the funeral of my great aunts. When we got to @ LOCATION2 we drove to the upper peninsula. Turns out we were going to an island in @ LOCATION3 lake called @ LOCATION1 island. Then, when we arrived at my cousin @ CAPS3 @ PERSON1, she gave us the will. My @ CAPS1 got @ NUM1 acres, @ NUM2 forest acres, @ NUM3 grassland acres, and @ NUM3 acres with a two bedroom house, barn, and smokehouse.

 When I was fifteen I was so anxious to get my license. I didn't study for it, but I thought to myself how hard could it really be? The first time I went for the test I went with my best friend @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 had already passed the test once and failed, so she tried again. We arrived at @ ORGANIZATION1 at @ NUM1 exact time. I was sitting there impatiently waiting to take my test and that's when they called my number. The women of @ ORGANIZATION1 were very nice to me she said "all I need is your birth certificate, your social security and proof of registration" I gave her the envelope that I had containing all of this. She agreed to go take my test. I sat down at computer number six. I was not at all nervous, I thought how not to succeed. When the test started there were so many questions about things I didn't know like motorcycles, left turns and things about the animals that were on the road. I finished the test with @ PERCENT1 I only needed @ PERCENT2 to pass, I was disappointed that I failed. @ PERSON1 however had passed her test I was happy for her and congratulated her but I was still somehow jealous of her. My @ CAPS2 and @ PERSON1 told me "it's good, you will have it next time for sure!" @ CAPS1 they were wrong. I was supposed to be one of the first people in my group of friends to get the permit. I had no idea all of my other friends would get it before I did. It seemed like every week a friend of mine would get his license and let me go. I was extremely disheartened and sad about it because somehow I felt like a failure, but I was determined to get my license no matter how many times it took me. I returned @ DATE1 after taking my license test for the first time to retake my test, I failed, I failed the second time. I went back five more times, failed my license exam five times. My @ CAPS2 and I were driving home one morning after failing. I was very sad because I was going to have to wait another month before I could take it. That's when my @ CAPS2 started to laugh hysterically at me. I was very confused as to why she was acting this way. She told me "sometimes you just have to relax in situations and learn that it's okay not always to do things right the first time life is about sticking to things and having fun if you can't laugh at the mistakes that are made then what's the fun in that ? " I realized she was absolutely right and that's when I stopped fighting for not getting my license. I laughed hysterically the rest of the drive home. I didn't mind not being successful because I knew I was going to get it if I relaxed and studied. The next month I went back to take the test again. I went through all the steps of @ ORGANIZATION1 again. I waited for them to call my number, gave my information to the women and sat down at the computer. I have @ PERCENT3 this time ! I was so happy and so happy to have succeeded, I was mostly just surprised that @ CAPS2's advice worked. @ DATE1 that day I was driving home from the store with my @ CAPS2. I wasn't the best driver I think because it was only my first day, and she was yelling at me to slow down and hit the brakes as I pulled into the driveway. I had taken the gas for the brake and I ran towards the garage door. Surprisingly, she had started to laugh and it made me laugh. Instead of yelling at me and picking up on me for this mistake we got to laugh about it and I think that's what made all the difference because if she had yelled at me I would have been discouraged to try again To drive. Now I have had my license for four months, not only am I a better pilot, but I have learned to relax a little more, I have learned to laugh a lot more and not take so many big simple things at the world for granite. I also think it brought me closer to my @ CAPS2 in a way, so I guess it's true what they say "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people".

  About @ NUM1 years ago, my best friend @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS6 I was sleeping at her house. We were in her mom's room playing with this huge exercise ball. We had jumped, stood, turned, @ CAPS6 anything you could think of, but trying to do it without falling! @ LOCATION1 went to do that flip on the ball @ CAPS6 she said "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 look at that cool thing I just did!" @ CAPS3 she is trying to do the same as she did, but she is wrong, @ CAPS6 the giant ball has flown under her ! We started having a good laugh @ CAPS3 ! It was funny @ CAPS3 that she almost peed in her pants ! But then her older sister came in, @ CAPS6, that's when it all started ... @ PERSON1, ((@ LOCATION1's older sister) has always been much taller than us @ CAPS3 us did @ CAPS8, she said, whatever @ CAPS8. As soon as she came in we quit @ CAPS8 we were doing ! She said she wanted to play a game with us, @ CAPS3 we decided to play too. @ PERSON1 told us to get on the bed @ CAPS6 to get under the covers. @ CAPS3 we did @ CAPS6 just as we turned off the light ! @ CAPS6 the door slammed! We didn't know if she was still in the room or not @ CAPS3 we didn't say a word next thing you know barley streams door opens @ CAPS6 you can see some light through the crack. She was back, @ CAPS6 with supplies! He was silent for about @ NUM2 minutes, then @ LOCATION1 starts screaming ! Just when I look @LOCA TION1 gets pulled out of bed by his feet. As I try to pull her up, I feel someone grabbing my feet! There you have it, where @ LOCATION1 is ! We kept trying to hide, @ CAPS6 got up on the bed, but we finally gave up because our plan didn't work out very well. All of a sudden my feet were tied together! Then my hands @ CAPS6 mouth! @ PERSON1 kept throwing us around the room @ CAPS6 hitting us, she thought that was the funniest thing in the world! She was laughing loudly @ CAPS3, especially when we were trying to get back on the bed with our hands tied @ CAPS6 feet. After an hour of struggle, @ CAPS6 @ LOCATION1 had an idea ! We thought if we hid in the bathroom she couldn't get us @ CAPS6 anymore, we would try to untie the bandanas @ CAPS6 strings. But before we could do that, @ PERSON1 beat us ! She threw us into the bathroom corner with the lights off! It was silent. " @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS8, is that noise ? " I said. "@ CAPS4 the bath !" she said. We tried to get out, but just as we did, @ PERSON1 picked us up @ CAPS6 threw us ! She laughed all the time! While we were screaming yelling at each other. @ CAPS6 for help ! When we got out of the tub she threw us on the bed @ CAPS6 finally untied our bandanas @ CAPS6 strings! After turning the light back on we looked at our wrists @ CAPS6 ankles @ CAPS6, there were red marks all over. @ LOCATION1 said "@ CAPS5 ! You're crazy, we told you to stop @ CAPS6, you didn't !" @ CAPS6 right after she shouts that @ CAPS7 from @ LOCATION1 is coming in. "@ CAPS8 is that all screaming for girls?" @ CAPS6 then everything came out ! Eventually @ ORGANIZATION1 had problems @ CAPS6, we got away with it. @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS6 I learned a huge lesson. Never "play a game" with your older sister when she has @ CAPS6 string bandanas!

@ PERSON1 @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 A @ DATE1 from @ DATE1 broke me and a @ CAPS3 went @ CAPS1 with my @ CAPS5 on the boat at @ LOCATION1. We've been waiting all week to go catch salmon @ DATE1 @ CAPS4. This @ DATE3 @ TIME1, we had to prepare the boat to be able to leave that day. Our boat is big so we put all of our stuff in it like sleeping bags, food coolers and all the @ CAPS1 gear we would need for the salmon. we also brought a camping stove for our food which we prepare on the boat. There was also another guy named @ PERSON2 but we call him fat @ PERSON2 he is a very funny guy who made a lot of laughs on the boat. When we got there we had to stop at a bait shop to buy shrimp and spinning blades which is what we use to catch salmon. We leave and as soon as we get to the boat launching ramp my @ CAPS5 realizes he forgot to take hooks while we were at the store. So we take the boat out of the water, luckily the boat was still on the trailer, we collect all the things safely in the boat and go to the store. Just as we get to the bait location the lady we spoke to earlier said we forgot to grab the hooks we bought but sometimes we forgot I don't know how. So we say thank you and go back to the river. We finally put our boat in the water and go up the river to where we're going to do our @ CAPS1, and it's a popular place where there would be a line of boats called the hog line and some how we would be. always how to enter the middle where is the best @ CAPS1. There would usually be @ DATE2 days like @ NUM1 boats on either side of us and it got hectic and sometimes funny because some of the guys out there don't even know how to operate a boat. When we got there after getting our sticks ready we put them in the water my stick fell off and hooked up a nice shiny @ CAPS4 and fought it for about five minutes and my @ CAPS5 has it caught and it was a guard fish. After all my @ CAPS5 said it was a little fish. Towards nightfall, we rolled up sticks and stowed them neatly in the boat. As soon as it got dark it was time to go to bed and it was quite right on the river. The next morning it was cold and windy, but luckily we brought our top to protect us from the wind burns as the last time we went we were so blasted by the wind it hurt us. hurts for about a week. finally my friends post falls off and he is all excited to hook a fish about ten minutes go by and he realizes he has hung on a floating log me and my @ CAPS5 knew he had it hooked but we didn't want to say anything because it would be funny if he was all excited. My @ CAPS5's perch goes down and it was fish so I drop anchor we float down catch it in the net another fish also to bring home and we had two in the boat but my boyfriend is the only one who needs a fish so we all have one to take home. After all day on the boat, it was time to come home and get ready for the begging of the week. Around two o'clock, I look over the tip of my rod which slams in the water, another fish within reach, he fights it, he had trouble staggering because the trail was tight but then I fix it , he gets in the boat, his first salmon, he was happy. perfect timing, because about a quarter of an hour later we are leaving to go home. the @ CAPS2 was fun, we had fish, we had fun times, and most importantly I had my buddy his first salmon.

 There have been many times in my life where laughter was the key ingredient. My family always laughs. We could laugh at a movie or a joke someone just made. We laugh even when the jokes are aimed at us. The same can be said of me and my friends. My friends and I laugh about almost everything. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important parts of my life, without it life would hardly have meaning. I remember a @ DATE2 when my friends and I decided to go camping by a lake for a week. We all packed our tents, sleeping bags and other camping necessities. When we got to the lake it wasn't very crowded so we had no trouble choosing a campsite. Once we were done unpacking our gear and setting up our tents, we decided to go swimming. A friend of mine shouted, " I'm going to rush you to the lake !" " @ CAPS1 was about five steps before @ CAPS1 enters a small hole in the perfect size for her foot and adapts @ CAPS1 falls flat on his face. Everyone started to laugh, it was like we couldn't stop. When my friend who had fallen finally got up, @ CAPS1 was laughing too. We spent the rest of @ DATE1 swimming and laughing about his fall, the best part was @ CAPS1 joked as well. That night we lay awake eating hot dogs and junk food smores until we almost popped, then one by one we all passed out. over the next two days we did pretty much the same things. We swam in the lake, hiked in the woods, fished a bit and laughed at each other most of the time. On the @ DATE1 we were there we all decided to get up early and hike @ DATE1 to the top of the nearest mountain. The trip to the top went well and no one fell or got hurt. The only eventful thing that happened on the way up was that a friend of mine dropped his water bottle and had to chase it halfway up the mountain. For us it was funny but not as funny as what happened next. Before we got off we all had a "pot break" as a friend of mine called it, the only problem with that was that a friend of mine decided to pee in what @ CAPS1 thought was an empty hole. It turned out that the set was not empty but was home to hundreds of underground wasps. Unfortunately for us, @ CAPS1 didn't realize it until it was too late. The wasps started to come out of their homes looking for anyone who was bothering them, which turned out to be us. I screamed in horror : "@ CAPS2 shit, it's a honeycomb !" Next thing I knew was we were running as fast as we could down the mountain with apparently thousands of wasps following us. The lucky ones had finished relieving themselves and fled with ease, the unlucky ones were not quite finished and had not yet pulled their pants up. Running with your pants around your ankles isn't an easy thing to do in case you're wondering and two of my friends find out the hard way. As they were trying to get away they tripped over themselves and started rolling all the @ CAPS1s as they got stung by the wasps. We all made it down the mountain with very few injuries and not too many bee stings. I remember the first thing we did when we got back was laugh until wept. Once we were out of danger this case seemed like the funniest thing that ever happened. My friends and I always bring up stories about our crazy camping trip and meeting the grumpy underground wasps at this @ DATE1. I still think this is one of the funniest things that will happen in my life and I look forward to the next crazy event. I believe that laughter has been one of the most important parts of my life, without it life would hardly have meaning.

 My alarm went off at @ TIME1. It was another normal @ DATE1 for all of my friends, but a big day for me. It was time to get up, have my breakfast, brush my teeth, put the last few things in my suitcase and head to the airport. This time @ CAPS1 I was going to fly on a plane across the ocean, and it was the last day with my family at @ LOCATION3 for a whole year. The next time I wake up, it will be in a totally different place, country, and family, where I've never been before. It will be a new beginning for me and my life will not be the same. I will be an exchange student in a high school at @ LOCATION1. After changing planes @ NUM1 times and @ NUM2 hours of travel, I was finally at @ LOCATION2 airport, where my foster parents were waiting for me with a large sign that had my name on it. I was very happy and excited to finally arrive, but above all I was really tired. We took off and headed "home". My new home was a little green house on a small ranch in the high desert of @ LOCATION4, @ NUM3 minutes out of town, and with no public transportation. Due to the hot temperatures and dry air I was very tired the @ CAPS1 weeks. The adaptation took me about a month. Before the start of the school year, I visited my new high school and I met the principle of the school. I also got my schedule and signed up for the soccer team, which had their @ CAPS1 reunion on the following @ DATE2. It was good to see children who will be in my school and in my classes. Finally, my high school day @ CAPS1 arrived. It was exciting for me, but I couldn't hide that I was very nervous. After an hour's drive to school, I got off the school bus and entered the building. I felt like thousands of people were looking at me in the hallway. I walked faster. I was hoping my day @ CAPS1 would start well. Finally, I reached my locker, pulled out the little piece of paper with my locker combination on it, and tried to open it. Even though I've done this @ NUM1 times, my locker won't open. "@ CAPS1 turn it @ NUM1 right once, go to number @ CAPS1, go left, skip second number once ..." I whispered to myself. The bell has already rung and luckily a friend I knew from football stopped by and asked if I needed help. We both started laughing and I was so glad she helped me out or I would have been late for class on the day of @ CAPS1. The next two times I needed his help again, until I figured out how to open my locker three days later. Being open-minded, being friendly and smiling are three very important things in life. Besides that, another very important thing for me is also to laugh at the mistakes that I make. More than anything else, discovering a new culture, a new country and meeting new people has given me a lot of experience for my life. Above all, learn to laugh at mistakes or situations so as not to be frustrated. Being frustrated would have made my time more difficult and less enjoyable. Laughing makes it easier for me to learn from my mistakes and move on. My mom once told me to be brave to make mistakes, and I don't regret any mistakes I made.

 He laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day. It was right after @ DATE1 and @ PERSON2 and I had just settled our intermittent relationship. He had picked up @ CAPS1 at my house so that we could spend some time at his house. He had seemed upset since choosing @ CAPS1, which was completely out of the norm for him. He was still smiling or laughing and had a fun story to tell @ CAPS1, but not today. Today he was calm, we had been together for about two hours already and he had said just about one sentence to @ CAPS1 and I had only had one of those lame half-smiles that really meant "I don't. I'm not in the mood so stop ". We were watching Despicable @ CAPS1 for about the third time when the screaming started he was standing against the wall next to his bed when his dad just started screaming his voice was followed by a louder and softer voice screaming back, it was @ PERSON2's mother-in-law. They were arguing over cheating, drinking or staying out too late, I really can't remember, I couldn't hear very well and I was watching @ PERSON2 to watch his reaction. He stayed where he was for a few minutes, looking right in front of him, it looked like he was going to cry. Then he collapsed to the ground, pulled his knees up, crossed his arms over them and put his head on his arms, for a second I thought he was crying. My big badass who's never faced anyone's bullshit looked as hurt and helpless as he could be, he looked more helpless than me. I mean what I could do, I wasn't sure if he wanted to be left alone or if he wanted someone to hug him and make him feel better so I sat down where I was, on his bed leaning against the wall just staring at him hoping he does something to help @ CAPS1 decide what would help him feel better. In the living room her parents were still screaming and yelling at each other when another voice joined them, it was her stepmother's friend, @ PERSON1. She was trying to keep them from fighting, trying to help, but @ PERSON2's dad, @ PERSON3, wasn't the type to interrupt, when he was angry you just stayed away. @ PERSON1 made a mistake. Suddenly there was a crash, @ PERSON2 jumped out, and the sound of slamming cupboards and shattered glass, the only statement I could make was "that was your grandma, your mom is going to be pissed off ! " from @ PERSON2's mother-in-law. @ PERSON2 got up, walked to his door and locked it. He stood there for a second, his forehead against the door, then he turned and walked over to @ CAPS1, laid down @ CAPS1 and snuggled up with @ CAPS1. There was more screaming now, something about food and cars and getting everyone out of the house. There was the sound of throwing food, then a slamming door and the screeching of tires. Finally, they were done. @ PERSON3 was leaving too, as you could see by the sound of a big diesel truck leaving. Now that we were alone @ PERSON2 finally looked @ CAPS1 I could tell he was sad he still looked like he wanted to cry. I could tell he hated fights and that's when I realized that was what was wrong with him all day, they had been fighting like that all week, they were in the process of divorce. It was not the first divorce he had experienced either, it was his father's third wife who had just walked through the door. "@ CAPS2 this is hell and really scary. Promise @ CAPS1 WE are @ CAPS3 going to fight like this?" I said. I had @ CAPS3 heard someone fight like that and frankly it scared @ CAPS1, I wish @ CAPS3 would want this kind of thing to happen in my house. "I promise you." he smiles. I kissed him on the nose and I went myself up but he pulled @ CAPS1 down and kissed my nose, I looked and I smiled "@ CAPS4, I really really pee. " That's all it took, he laughed, I hadn't heard his laugh all day.

  @ DATE1 @ CAPS2's @ CAPS1 dog made me laugh every time I saw his floppy ears and little pointy nose. @ CAPS2 was my best friend, my dog. @ CAPS3 brought me happiness every moment I was with her. Barking at squirrels in the garden to keep me warm at night. All the crazy things this amazing dog did made me smile. Laughter and joy in my heart. Every @ DATE1 when we went camping with the @ PERSON1 family, we had to bring it with us. We had to bring him his own sleeping bag and camping chair to sit on. After a long day of swimming and walking around the lake, @ CAPS2 would jump into his chair and fall asleep by the hot fire. When we walked with the other family's dog @ PERSON2, @ CAPS3 wore his own leash as if in his mouth as if I were holding it. Every little thing @ CAPS2 did differently than the average dog made us laugh. @ CAPS2 was "@ CAPS4" as we called it. @ CAPS3 also liked to "connect". @ CAPS2 pulled logs or giant sticks into the water and chewed them until only back was left. All the grandparents loved him too. Grandpa had special cookies just for her because @ CAPS2 didn't like any cookie. The time @ CAPS2 went to his house on his birthday with his own party hat, hopping on his knees to give him a birthday kiss. He laughed so hard that his eyes started to cry. Every time we went somewhere the other grandma would beg to "@ CAPS6-sit", @ CAPS3. Che loved her so much. When @ CAPS2 was there, @ CAPS2 did not have a kennel or dog bed, @ CAPS2 had the sofa. @ CAPS2 would take @ CAPS3 into town to buy him a cheeseburger and go to the park. I taught him to do tricks like @ LOCATION1 where @ CAPS2 bounced on his hind legs in circles, and I also taught @ CAPS16 to talk. I would say "@ CAPS9 is on top of a house ?" "@ CAPS10. (@ CAPS11)", "Who was the best @ CAPS12 player ever ?" "@ CAPS10 (@ CAPS14 @ CAPS15)" and "@ CAPS16, does sandpaper feel ?" "@ CAPS10." It made everyone laugh. We spent hours just doing tricks and playing in the backyard. Our family took her to @ CAPS9 which we called "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS1" to the river to go swimming and fishing with us. @ CAPS2 had fun running and splashing around with us in the water. We also took her to the coast to play on the beach. We took her everywhere with us and @ CAPS2 loved it. @ CAPS2 was also the only dog in the park who knew @ CAPS16 how to slide. Everyone was so amazed at @ CAPS9 that @ CAPS2 could do. They had never seen anything like it before. @ CAPS3 made many people laugh and smile when they saw her. @ CAPS2 was my best friend and the smartest dog I know. From going to the park, sledding, camping and swimming to just being a lazy dog, @ CAPS2 made me laugh. @ CAPS2 is gone now, but his memory is still there. @ CAPS2 will never be forgotten.

The Importance of Laughter in Human Life There are many things in life that make a person happy, but none come close to the joy of laughter. @ CAPS1 and her friends always get together and share a good laugh, that's why we get together, to have a great time with those we love and appreciate to be with us. My @ CAPS1 gets together every Thanksgiving and it's always one of my favorite times because when my @ CAPS2 shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you fall to the floor crying because you laugh so hard. He has this sense of how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh can turn a bad day into a great day. @ CAPS1 is the best thing anyone could ask for and when everyone is together it only makes the weather sweeter, now add a laugh, a few smiles and you have a blast ! My @ CAPS2 has so many jokes and cheesy lines that he can use to try and make someone laugh, but it's not just what he says that makes him so funny, it's the moment he the fact. I want to learn from him and use his relationship skills to reciprocate and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and putting a little smile on their face because not only does it make them feel good, but it can also make you feel better knowing that you just helped someone else have a better day just by telling a little joke or saying something funny that got enough attention, and you never know that a person might one day go back and remember what you did for them and tell them somebody else and then it's a domino effect. He / she will tell someone what happened and he / she will make someone else's day better just with a simple chuckle. Most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with each other, sometimes that's all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime. life. So everyone can share a good laugh, no matter who you are or where you are from, everyone is subject to "hoots and screams" from time to time. When I now met my best friend who is like a brother to me, it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgettable laugh. From that day until now we've been the best friends life could have afforded us, so all it takes is you really wanted to go out and just be yourself and make someone laugh. Laughter is the biggest thing in life that people have to do every day to keep their spirits up and up, no matter what the circumstances. The military have to go to war and live in a hostile environment, but they always find time to sit down. as a unit and share a drink and luagh about something. Enjoying life is in our blood so don't try to avoid people or the luaghter who wants to hang out. When you are having a terrible day the best thing you can do is go to a boyfriend's house and hang out because the people who really care about you will find a way to liven up your mind and make you laugh, what will make you smile and have a whole new start to the day is like refreshment for your body. When I'm having a bad day all I have to do is think of something me and a friend did that was funny and it will either bring a smile to my face or an outgoing laugh and sometimes both. Laughter is the key to life because it can turn anything negative into positive. When you go to a party with @ CAPS1 or friends you sit in the back and think of nothing, no you get up and have a good time with your friends and always end up sharing a good laugh with someone a. I believe with all my heart that laughter is not only the key to life but the key inside a person, it shows who they are because no one can hide or shake the urge to laugh of something funny, it's just not possible for someone to do. Laughter comes from the heart and soul inside a person and these two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you cannot deny the need . When two or more people are together, the ability to create an environment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy laughter, not just pretend, which is what everyone is looking for, so when someone says that, it is. is so true "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people".

 @ CAPS1 ago when I was about @ NUM1 years old. I had moved to @ LOCATION1, after @ NUM2 weeks passed @ CAPS2 parents started going to church, while we were in church I met another kid who was around @ CAPS2. I did not know but I saw in his hand. @ CAPS6 has a deck of cards. I noticed right away that @ CAPS6 liked to play yu-gi-oh which is a card game which is a lot of fun to play when I was @ NUM1 ..., I wanted to ask him if @ CAPS6 wanted playing card game yu-gi-oh but i was too nervous to ask her after church ended and @ CAPS2's parents and i came home last day. The next morning I had to get ready for the first day of school from @ CAPS2 to @ LOCATION1, it was a bit difficult as I am going to be in this new school with no friends but once I got them I noticed something right away i saw the same thing kid from yesterday i was a little surprised because @ CAPS6 would be going to the same church as me. After the @ CAPS2 teacher told me to sit down I sat down, the @ CAPS2 teacher started the call saying each student is their class name, each student responded and said “ Here ! » When it came to that trick of other kids his name was @ PERSON1, once class started it all went a bit fast when you are busy doing class work, so after lunch started I went to lunch and surprisingly a lot of students in class @ CAPS2 are nice they asked me if I wanted to be their friends. I was happy since they asked, but this kid @ PERSON1 didn't ask. So I thought @ CAPS6 was mad at me later after school before getting on the bus home. @ CAPS6 "answered yes, and you?" I "told them yes we should play yu-gi-oh sometimes" @ CAPS6 said we could play this @ DATE1 at church. I told them @ CAPS3. later that day i told @ CAPS2 older brother @ CAPS4 i made some friends at school, and this @ DATE1 i am going to play yu-gi-oh card with one from them named @ PERSON1 who goes to church, @ CAPS2 brother @ CAPS4 told me oh ... @ PERSON1 goes to school? I said yes and @ CAPS6 said I played the yu-gi-oh card game with him last time at church. I was shocked since @ CAPS2's older brother knew @ CAPS6 was and I didn't at that time. I asked him why @ CAPS6 didn't tell me that @ CAPS6 knew someone who played pay per view yu-gi-oh, @ CAPS6 said "because you didn't ask" I was like. .. Oh ..... Me and @ CAPS2's brother started laughing because I didn't know @ PERSON1 was an older brother friend of @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS6 made fun of me because I didn't him ever wondered if @ CAPS6 knew anyone who played the yu-gi-oh card game.

 It was @ DATE1. The day was beautiful and full of happy faces. A perfect day to be at the fair. I was sitting on a bench next to @ PERSON1 this guy I really liked, but I doubted @ CAPS6 of course likes me. I had caught him looking at me a few times and just thought I had something on my face that really grabbed his attention, like a piece of food since we had just a few minutes ago or something. I looked at it and asked "@ CAPS1?" funny, but .. "@ CAPS6 paused for a while." @ CAPS5 can I ask @ CAPS13 to come out ? " @ PERSON1 asked. I felt my face turn red, my body temperature rose and my leg started to move uncontrollably. "@ CAPS6 can't know I have strong feelings for him," I thought to myself. "@ CAPS7 is just playing like @ CAPS10 he's joking..because @ CAPS6 is joking , right ? "" @ CAPS8 @ PERSON2 ? Are @ CAPS13 okay ? " @ CAPS6 asked as @ CAPS6 put her hand on my lap." @ CAPS9 I'm fine, it's just… "I took a long break." @ CAPS10 @ CAPS13 said @ CAPS3 I @ CAPS17 understand "@ CAPS6 said as his head was slowly facing the ground. I didn't know @ CAPS1 to say it, I felt stuck. I wanted to say @ CAPS14 a lot but the words just wouldn't come out . " @ CAPS11 don't mess with me like that, I know you are joking @ PERSON1 "I laughed nervously. @ PERSON1 looked at me with a confused face like @ CAPS10 @ CAPS6 was saying" Wasn't I clear enough " or “@ CAPS12, am I just walking away?” Her smile turned into a serious expression and the glint in her eyes was gone. I felt something in my throat, the words were stuck and they had to come out !. "@ CAPS13 can ask me out anytime and my response @ CAPS17 will always be @ CAPS9" I said I felt relived. "@ CAPS14 does that make @ CAPS13 my girlfriend @ PERSON2? "" I don't know @ PERSON1 .. @ CAPS13 hasn't asked me out yet "I said with a smile on my face. We looked at each other for a second and burst out laughing, like @ CAPS10, c was the funniest thing in the world. I didn't quite understand why we were laughing and @ CAPS6 either, but that didn't stop us. I started to feel a stomach cramp because of it. e with all the force I was putting on my stomach, which made me stop laughing. @ PERSON1 took my hand and we headed for the roller coaster. In my head, I imagined him kneeling on one knee and asking me to be his girlfriend, and by then the background noises would disappear, and the camera would only be focused on us. Although that probably only happens at the end of a romantic movie where everyone lives "happily ever after". I watched @ PERSON1 realizing I wasn't in a movie, I was in this place called reality. @ CAPS6 looked at me like @ CAPS10 I had something on my face again, but it didn't really bother me anymore. We rode on the roller coaster and a few other rides which totally made me feel like I needed to throw up. I was standing in the queue for some reason I felt this joy inside of me like @ CAPS10 I was the happiest person in this world. @ CAPS2 bothered me that day even though something was supposed to bother me, I just ignored it because I felt like @ CAPS10 didn't really matter. I had the biggest smile on my face like @ CAPS10 I had just received the bot-ox and couldn't put on any other expression than this. The sun hid behind the clouds, and the day darkened right before my eyes. I felt like the day had not been long enough because of all the fun I had had. I was starting to believe that time flies really fast, even though I knew better than that. It was time to come home and the people coming out of the fair had exhausted looks that didn't even let them smile because they were @ CAPS14 exhausted. @ PERSON1 and I walked over to the car. As we walked @ CAPS6 looked a little worried. "@ CAPS15 fake @ PERSON1" I asked, noticing his unhappy expression @ CAPS14. “I haven't officially asked @ CAPS13 to come out,” @ PERSON1 said. "@ CAPS16 ask me that I am ready" I replied Jorge rushed in front of me and stopped me from walking. "@ CAPS17 @ CAPS13 be my girlfriend @ PERSON2..Once again?" @ CAPS6 grindButterflies ran along my stomach and my feet got weaker. "uhhhh..i mean @ CAPS9 of course @ CAPS7 be your girlfriend" I stammered. I guess the expression on my face was hilarious or something because @ CAPS6 started to laugh. @ CAPS14 I decided to laugh too even though I didn't know @ CAPS1 was funny but hey. We got in the car and drove home. On the way it was pretty quiet, but it was worth it.

  In all of our lives there is that one person who is so special that you would never do anything to hurt them. Whether that person is a close friend, relative or family member. The people who are meaningfully involved in our lives are there to help us through tough times, uplift us when we're down, and be there for us. Friends are one of the most important people we have in life. Friends are someone we can talk to and understand, someone we share everything with, including clothes, food, etc. They are the ones who accompany us every day with a smile. High school is filled with drama, it's the same old story just, a different day. I have the best group of friends, we are very close and spend a lot of time together in school and outside of school. They are there for me when I need them most. Recently this guy @ PERSON1 and I tried to work on our relationship but he lied to me and cheated on me but all my friends that I tell about the situation are saying the same thing, "he's going to hurt you" and "he is not worth your tears". I have classes with him every other day. It's not like I can choose when I want and don't want to see it, some days are just better than others. The bell rang, right after lunch, and I was in no rush to go to the group room. The group room is very big, smells of old cheese and looks like a trampoline so the sound bounces and explodes in your face. I don't like this course at all. I casually walked into the room and put all my books on my chair and started walking towards my locker. I grabbed my instrument and went back to put it in my chair and went to talk with some of my friends. It hadn't been a bad day so far, it was just a regular day at school. As I walked into the group room, I got the feeling that @ DATE1 was different. He walked through the group door with a huge smile on his face but I couldn't help but look away and frown. Mixed emotions are the worst, he does one thing and you like him and he does another thing that drives you crazy and makes you want to hurt him. He's sitting right behind me in the group and I constantly turn to talk to him, but we never seem to be in trouble except for @ DATE1, we were supposedly talking too much. I don't think we talk much, because @ DATE1 was where I didn't want anything to do with him. He was angry with me and I was angry with him, so we were tied. Twenty-five minutes passed, each minute dragging on and I thought only of him and what I had heard he was doing. It is never nice to know that something is wrong. I confronted him with what people were telling me. His response was "don't believe what you hear, believe what you see." I had no idea what was going on, but tears started to flow from my eyes, streaming down my face like a crystal clear waterfall. I asked my teacher if I could take a minute in the hallway, and she agreed, so I sat in the hallway, tears streaming down my face. A friend of mine came out and sat down with me to comfort me. We started talking and I told him everything that was going on. She hugged me and started making jokes on him. I couldn't help but laugh. I even smiled and made my own remarks which made him laugh too. After a few jokes and hugs, the tears were gone and I smiled. Neither of us wanted to go back to class, but we really didn't have any other options. We weren't very close friends, but our conversation in class made us stronger. Even when things are going badly, you have to rely on your friends to tell you the truth and give their advice because they are always right, so don't guess them. They know how to make you feel better and it always seems to work. Laughter is more than an emotion. It gives you strength when you are weak. It builds you up when you're down. Laughter brings relationships together, and sometimes all we need is a smile. Laughter also helps create memories, the nights you stay awake talking and laughing until two in the morning are the ones you will remember forever. Laughter is an important aspect for everyone, we all need a day to relax and step back to laugh.

  Laughter is the only expression in my opinion that is always positive. My dad claims laughter is the reason for his six pack, it works your muscles. @ CAPS3 is very important in a relationship. If @ CAPS5 has no sense of humor, consider yourself inhuman. When it comes to my family, I'm always @ CAPS3. @ CAPS3 is always positive and happiness is in life. If I have a problem I think of something that would make me laugh, a laugh is always nice. Relationships can be created by having things in common, seeing my father and I don't always get along. When we laugh, everything else is silent, it sets the mood. If @ CAPS5 didn't laugh with my dad, he would ask "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS5 has a bad sense of humor ?" @ CAPS2 again if your not @ CAPS3 with me at something funny, @ CAPS5 must be a stranger. @ CAPS3 is positive and positive energy is good. I laugh a lot, I laugh hard. @ CAPS5 would not have the relationships @ CAPS5 have @ DATE1 if it were not for @ CAPS3. Some people say that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I agree with this statement. If it hadn't been for the laughter I think I would be very negative, I would be more disciplined and think I would be more distant with my dad. As I get older I see myself maturing, I laugh a lot less ... My dad also sees the change, we have moved away from each other which is normal with every growing teenager. My dad is very funny, and while I'm happy growing up, I wouldn't trade the world for the humorous relationship I have with my dad. Laughter is everywhere, I see people walking down the street @ CAPS3 on their cell phones. I have heard of the phrase "@ CAPS3 to the bank", I would be @ CAPS3 if I was rich too. Being rich is a positive thing, but if @ CAPS5 is not @ CAPS3 and happy in life, then money means nothing. I could be poor and @ CAPS3, and still be happy. If @ CAPS5 isn't happy in life, then everything @ CAPS5 has or has worked on means nothing. Laughter brings people together, r @ CAPS2 has no doubts. I have met a lot of people just by "@ CAPS3". @ CAPS5 will be surprised what @ CAPS5 can achieve by just smiling at you, or if @ CAPS5 finds something funny, "@ CAPS6". I have a very humorous daddy, I wouldn't change him. I believe everything happens for a reason, and I believe everyone deserves a good laugh and to be happy. I think they deserve it, it's a shame that not everyone is happy in life, so why doesn't @ CAPS5 personally go out of their way to make someone laugh ? @ CAPS5 doesn't know their situation, it's almost possible that a laugh could take @ CAPS5 from many places. @ CAPS5 never know what a laugh will do for @ CAPS5 until @ CAPS5 finds out ? Laughter is a strong element in relationships and can build a personality profile of someone and who they are.

Have you ever seen the expression @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2, Laughs ? Have you ever wondered what this means? I believe it can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. There are people who can take it negatively and then there are people who take it positively, I believe those words @ NUM1 in this sentence are all you need to have a perfect life. A perfect life is not about having the best car, the most expensive clothes, or the best physical appearance. I'll tell you why laughter is so important in any type of relationship. I'm @ NUM2 now but I was @ NUM3 when I met the person who made me laugh no matter what. He is a large male with brown skin. He is now @ NUM4 years old. but he was @ NUM2 when I met him. It all started at school, that's where we met. He always made me laugh, I remember a time when I was very upset because I was having problems at home and being with him was something I needed to forget what was going on. He's a very honest person and that's what was good about him, he would make him make a joke of any situation. Even embarrassing things that were happening to me or that were happening to him, he would turn them around to the point where I wouldn't feel embarrassed anymore. I @ CAPS1 how I can be myself with him. He was climbing on a rocky roll-a-coaster. @ NUM1 years have passed and I am now married to this best friend I had and we have two beautiful twin daughters together and I @ CAPS2 my life to the fullest because it makes me happy. Instead of discussing his laughter and his life, it's just better that way, not only does it make me laugh, but it's what makes him a good person and people around him feel good. Laughter is not only good in a man-woman relationship, it is also good in a woman-woman relationship. I have a best friend. not only is she my best friend because she is honest and kind but because she is funny she makes me laugh we can laugh at the simplistic things that most people @ MONTH1 think we are crazy we don't are not just the sound of a happy life. I believe a life without laughing is like a boring and long straight road. life with laughter is like a winding road, you don't know what to expect. My mom and I have a pretty strong relationship, we do a lot of things together, but what I love most is the laughs we have sometimes when something happens at that time it can be downhill but a year after that day you look back and it's funny it's always better to laugh with someone you can consider dear. Laughing at the memories is what I love most about anyone because that memory you will always take with you and sooner or later you will laugh at the fact that it happened, when and where. So whenever something happens to you that you find @ MONTH1 embarrassing, look back a year from that day, I'm sure you'll get a laugh or at least a smile.

                   The @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 I was @ NUM1 years old and I lived on a farm next to @ LOCATION1 OU. I spent most of my time playing with my brothers, @ PERSON1, @ CAPS4 and @ CAPS5. We've done everything together, from caching frogs to eating bugs. We had just moved into a new home and my dad had a lot to do to make it a safe and fun environment. His first thing to do was build a pull @ CAPS3, which is a building on top of a garage. He started by pouring cement on the freshly bulldozed earth. He made square holes in the cement to put the posts in, so that he would hold the @ CAPS3 up. Then he started to do the main building above the garage he made. I was so excited to see my dad build this @ CAPS3 with his bare hands. After he secured everything inside, I was allowed in. I walked in and was amazed at how beautiful it was and how perfectly built it was. But there was still things to do. My dad and older brother @ PERSON2 were putting on the shingles so the rain and other bullshit couldn't get in. The next day I woke up with them hooting and screaming, like a bunch of chickens when they lay their first egg. They just finished the @ CAPS3 sweater. I jumped to my feet like a cat that had just been shot by an air pistol and ran down the stairs to meet them. When they entered it looked like they had fallen into a pond. They were drenched in sweat. Right away my brothers and I ran as fast as we could to the brand new @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3. When we entered the @ CAPS3, we had a strange feeling, like something was getting cold and wet on our feet. So we know what we had just done, we had just run on the freshly painted floor. We all looked at each other and started trying to find each other doing as little damage as possible. We walked backwards in our previous footprints. When we finally got to the stairs we had to find a way to cover up our mess we just made or else we would be in a lot of trouble. So we all came up with a plan, that was to paint over our footprints with the remaining paint. So right away we started painting over our mess that we had made, with the leftover paint that we found from the project. Soon we were all done and it was a great relief not to have a cot. Later that day my dad and older brother went to @ CAPS3 to see if the paint had dried. to their surprise, they sow a bunch of tiny footprints on the staircase leading to the freshly painted floor. As they went up the stairs, they saw more and more footprints. When they reached the top, they looked at the wet ground and they just sprinkled wet paint, no footprints. While all of this was going on, my brothers and I were watching from our window, we could see everything. Soon we sow them by returning so we went down to meet them. As they walked in I could see a puzzled look on their faces, it was a confused look. They walked in the door and looked me straight in the eye, it was like I had just stolen a hundred dollars and just got a cot. My dad politely said, " Can I see your feet ?" " " @ CAPS6 "I replied with a frightened face. I showed him my feet, then he said "did you maybe go to the @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 and then try to fix your mess by painting on it ?" I looked at him with a stupid face and said "@ CAPS6". He just smiled big and said, "go wash your feet." Later that day the ground dried up and we all went up there and had dinner.

 I woke up to @ NUM1 from a call from my cousin saying he wanted to go out and introduce me to my cousin I had never met before. after I hung up I hung up and rushed into the shower and got ready as fast as I could. once they got to my house I ran frantically to the door and opened it very quickly, expecting some kind of reaction from my new cousin, but the one I got was not what I expected. just when I opened the door he started laughing at me for a few minutes. I got a little mad at him because I didn't know what he was laughing at, until I looked down and realized I had no pants on, I rushed to my room and I put on some shorts and walked back to the living room while they were still in the bus laughing at my stupid mistake. i sat on the couch in front of them and asked them what they were laughing at and i did it on purpose for a joke they didn't believe me at all i don't blame them because it was the stupidest thing to say in this circumstance. after they stopped laughing my cousin asked me if it was the only thing i had done like that i said no and he started telling stories about him doing stupid stuff like i did, that ended up being the only topic we talked about for half the day, just reciting silly stories about ourselves that were embarrassing. it turns out that just because i made that stupid mistake it was easy for us to get along and start talking as soon as he walked in and that's why we've had a good relationship ever since our meeting. in the end i was happy i did it because it made us really close because now we can laugh at each other when either of us does stupid things. and this is my story in which laughter was an element in a relationship between my cousin and me.

It was @ NUM1 pm. at night i was watching @ CAPS1.V my dad said he was going to the store i wanted to go with him my mom said no because he was coming back soon he was only going to get a few things from the le store. My dad said everything was fine so i want with him on the way we saw a man on his bike he didn't have much control on his bike it looked like he was going to crash into the 'one of the poles, we walked past him, looked back at each other and the man on the bike was on the ground it was funny me and my dad were laughing but we stopped and helped the man, at the store me and my dad went separately I went to the candy area and he went the other way. I was done looking at the candy so I went to get my dad I couldn't find him where in the store so I went out to look for him the car was not there I thought he had gone in the other store i went there he was not there so i went to the store to look agen one more time he was gone so i started walking to my house while i was walking a car stopped and asked me if I would decrease a turn I said no thank you they insisted but I told them once that it was good that I live in the block next door, they left so I continued to walk. Seductively, I heard a noise behind me, I turned around and it was a big black shadow. I was afraid. A car passed me I looked and it was my father I tried to call him but he couldn't hear me he was walking away so I threw a rock at the car my father stopped immediately I ran towards her, my father saw me he told me that he had forgotten that he had taken me with him. At the end we both started to laugh, we didn't say anything to my mom because she would be done against my dad.

 Historically, people have paid a lot of attention to laughter. We cannot imagine our lives without @ CAPS9. We @ CAPS8 everyday, make jokes, smile. For me, laughter has always been one of the best things in the world! @ CAPS9 has helped me so many times in the most difficult situations. I want to tell you a story from my life where laughter played a huge role. @ CAPS9 it all started @ DATE1 in @ DATE2. I was living at @ LOCATION2 at that time and was trying to get a scholarship to go to @ LOCATION2 for a @ DATE1 as an exchange student. To do this I had to take a lot of tests, write millions of essays, go through all the paperwork ... one of the things I had to do was talk to the group of other participants and two @ CAPS1 for about an hour. So the people who have chosen the children to go abroad will consider how we can communicate with others. Can you imagine speaking a foreign language with a group of people you've never seen before? No. Especially when you all know that only one of the whole group will go to @ LOCATION1. You know everyone will try to be the best, the leader, and hardly ever let others say something. But I still hoped everything was going to be okay. I remember that day like @ CAPS9 was yesterday. Everything in the details. @ CAPS9 was @ DATE3 @ TIME1, when I walked into the big white building at @ ORGANIZATION1 where the competition was going to be held. I came into the classroom and two @ CAPS1 introduce us. And at that exact moment, when I saw three other people, at that precise second, I realized that I really must be worried! I saw their faces. They were thinking the same. We had nothing in common. At all. They all looked different. One girl was all in black. No kidding. the big black shoes looked like the old army shoes my grandfather had, the black skirt was longer than the girl, the black ties, the dark t-shirt, three or four sizes bigger than the girl; you can't even imagine how black her short straight hair looked. She looked like she was part of the darkest night of @ DATE1. Another girl was a complete "barbie girl". You know, typical @ CAPS3 - two vouchers for everyone. She was tall, thin, with long blond hair and pink clothes. All pink. Hot pink jeans, light pink top and high heels. I remember her saying to the girl in black something like "@ CAPS4 I'm the best here". Nothing else about it, just @ CAPS3. There was also a boy. He was a wonderful example of a rapper. His whole look, from shoes to attitude, only screamed how much he loves rap. No, love rap. Big blue jeans, cool shoes in @ ORGANIZATION2 representation companies, a white tee shirt with a popular rap musician face in @ LOCATION2, a hoodoo and a big hat. Also, he had a backpack and I could hear music from his I-pod. Well me, I was in new green pants, a gray top, a black cardigan, a cute gray handbag and black flats. I looked like a style-loving girl, I suppose. I can't tell you what they thought of me. I do not know. But I'm pretty sure I was a person who read magazines all the time and watched @ CAPS6 fashion shows. So we all looked super different from each other and seemed to be only interested in our own thing. And in nothing else. I didn't understand how we could be in the same group. But we were. The first ten minutes were difficult. We didn't know what to talk about because we were all so different. Two @ CAPS1 who were taking notes on our conversation decided to help us. They gave us a random word, something like "jungadzhumba" and told us to think about what @ CAPS9 is and run @ CAPS9. It sounded interesting to me, but not to others. Girl in black said @ CAPS9 is stupid. And then the next second the thing that changed everything happened. The boy said a joke about @ CAPS9. Yeah, just a joke, and I don't even remember what @ CAPS9 was, the only thing was @ CAPS9 was really funny. We started at @ CAPS8. And laughter helped us. We were talking for so long, over an hour, but @ CAPS9 seemed so fast! We were talking about everything in the world! So many topics we were talking about in this room, then after in the restaurant, and in the subway on the way home ... @ CAPS9 was a wonderful time! This day is very important to me now, because on this day I realized that laughter is the key to everything. I've heard @ CAPS9 before, but the real understanding was at this @ DATE3. Now my favorite line is : "@ CAPS8, if you don't know what to do, just @ CAPS8 !" @ CAPS9 will help you.

Laughter is an incredible feeling. @ CAPS1 feels good, @ CAPS1 feels wonderful, happy, secure and loved. That's what brings out the best in people, in my opinion. People laugh to show a sense of humor and to show love. I am rather a depressed person and my father always told me : "@ CAPS1 does not wrinkle, and then mouse kidding yourself." I predict laughter is what makes people who they really are. When @ CAPS1 is crazy, even sad. What does @ CAPS1 want to do ? I don't think @ CAPS1 wants to be cranky all day? I think @ CAPS1 would like your friends or family to make @ CAPS1 laugh, so that @ CAPS1 can get over what is getting on your nerves, move on and be happy. In life, nothing is more important than love and laughter. There is no love without laughing. No laughter without love. We need each other to continue our days. Especially for those who have been through a lot in life. Like me. I have family issues, I'm in second grade, but I'm still standing with a bright smile on my face. I know everything will be fine @ CAPS2, @ CAPS4 I'm @ CAPS2 just kidding. It makes me feel safe, makes me feel like I need myself in this world. I have been through so much that others admire me. When it comes to that, I know exactly @ CAPS2 what to do. Make them laugh. Nothing is more beautiful than human laughter. A lot of people have always wondered how I could be so strong, because of all the horrible situations I have been through since college. And I tell them, "@ CAPS2 is laughing. It makes @ CAPS1 feel a lot better at the end." I mean, @ CAPS1 @ MONTH1 feels silly when you're done laughing, but you also feel great. This @ CAPS1 can @ CAPS2 laugh and move on. Because that's life. Notihng is perfect, things will mess up, people come and go. There will be tears, and there will be laughter. When it comes to an end, let it go. Laugh, and @ CAPS2 be happy that he / she was yours. The memories last forever, cherish every moment @ CAPS1 has, laugh and live life as it is because it is too short to waste time and frown. Laughter is the beauty of a person's voice. Some are high, and some are low. Some are loud, others very quiet and giggle. I have a loud mouth. Also a big laugh. I'm very short, but the volume that comes out of me when I laugh makes @ CAPS3 so surprised. I entertain people with my laughter, depending on my mood, my laughter will change tone. Sometimes @ CAPS1 can tell my laughter is annoying, but I'm not afraid to laugh. I'm not, so have no fear talk about it and like the text messages @ CAPS3 sends to each other, laugh out loud. It'll be OK. It takes a lot of strength to make me stop laughing. Because I am a "blonde". @ CAPS3 says. Either way, I'll always laugh. In fourth grade, my teacher once said : "CAPS4 @ @ @ CAPS1 CAPS1 laugh a lot live longer.." Laughter is what makes me who I am today, and it has made me a better and stronger person. The most common thing people do is laugh. @ CAPS1 can walk in the hallway, in the mall, next door, outside, in a park, anywhere else. There will always be people laughing and sharing jokes all over the world. I'm glad people can talk while laughing.

Laughter is a @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 Do things like music, tears and laughter have in common ? @ CAPS19 are all universal languages - @ CAPS19 crosses all barriers @ CAPS1 to get the point across without words. @ CAPS21 was definitely the case when @ CAPS3 @ PERSON3's best friend came to visit me from @ LOCATION2. I was eight years old at the time. I had lived at @ LOCATION1 all my life, and hearing other languages was not something that happened to me regularly. When my @ CAPS3 announced that her roommate @ PERSON3 was coming to spend a few days with her family, I was apprehensive about trying to talk to them. However, my @ CAPS3 was encouraging. "@ CAPS4 will be a learning experience !" was his enthusiastic battle cry every time I moaned. "@ CAPS5 will learn @ CAPS6 and @ CAPS19 will learn @ CAPS7." @ CAPS4 was a cold stormy day @ ORGANIZATION2 when @ CAPS19 arrived. As @ CAPS19 pulled his blue minivan down our driveway, I @ CAPS12 was feeling shy. After all, I only had vague memories of visiting "@ CAPS9" @ PERSON3 years ago, and I had never met the rest of his family. However, my sense of worry was quickly replaced by the rich voice of @ CAPS9 @ PERSON3 : "@ CAPS11 ! @ CAPS5 has grown so big !" @ CAPS12 I was wrapped in her warm embrace and smelled the familiar scent of my @ CAPS9: chocolate, detergent and something spicy like she had just cooked. Soon @ ORGANIZATION1 started greeting my younger sister and I found myself awkwardly standing next to the three children of @ ORGANIZATION1. I realized I didn't know @ CAPS2 could tell them - or even how to tell them anything. While @ PERSON3 was bilingual, she still did not speak @ CAPS7 with her children. There was a total barrier @ CAPS1. The awkwardness passed momentarily as the adults intervened. @ PERSON3 rushed into our silent mass and started to introduce us. Her oldest was tall, dark haired @ PERSON1, who was twelve years old and worldly. Closest to my age was @ CAPS14, nine, who had a quick smile and a mischievous glint in his eyes. The youngest, @ PERSON2, was small even for her young age of four. I smiled and nodded as each one was introduced, and smiled and nodded some more when @ PERSON3 introduced me and my sister @ CAPS15. As @ CAPS19 replied to him in @ CAPS6, I marveled at how smart @ CAPS19 seemed to talk to another @ CAPS1. How, I wondered, did my @ CAPS7 look like to them ? My @ CAPS3 soon got us into the house. She had started to prepare dinner and @ PERSON3 joined her in our small kitchen to "catch up". For a while, we children stayed close to our parents, like birds hesitating to leave the nest. Soon, however, @ CAPS4 became apparent that seven people were too many to fit in one kitchen. "@ CAPS18, won't @ CAPS5 show them your rooms ?" my @ CAPS3 suggested. "@ CAPS19 still hasn't met @ CAPS20 !" @ CAPS21 seemed like a good idea, because @ CAPS20 our cat was friendly with everyone. @ CAPS15 and I led the way to find him while the @ CAPS23 was talking in a low voice @ CAPS6 behind us. As we entered the living room, @ PERSON2 @ CAPS12 let out a cry. She ran across the floor to @ CAPS20, who was napping in the sun. I was afraid she would startle him, but the overweight tabby just got up drowsy and yawned. And then, to our amazement, @ CAPS20 did something he had never done before. He jumped up and placed his hind legs on @ PERSON2's chest. She was a big cat and she was small, so @ CAPS4 turned out to be looking her in the eye. For a moment @ CAPS19 looked at each other in surprise, then she fell into a sitting position. Fearing that she might cry, I started to go and help her, but something completely different escaped her mouth: the infectious laughter of a four-year-old. For a while there was a startled silence from the rest of us as she screamed at @ CAPS4's hilarity, but soon we couldn't help but participate. And at that point, I realized we didn't even need to do it. learning each other's languages - the laughter we shared had broken the ice and the barrier @ CAPS1. I still fondly remember this visit today, as @ CAPS4 is the first time I realize how similar other cultures are to ours. It's true that we struggled to get along at the beginning. But in the end we had become friends, all because of a cat, a four year old, and the one @ CAPS1 we had in common - laugh.

 One day my brother and I were at the mall looking for a hat to buy. My brother came up to me and asked if he should get it, I told him he shouldn't so he handed it over. Later we continued on our way to look in a different store, I was in one store while my brother was in another. As I was about to make a purchase I felt a tap on my shoulder and looked and saw a guy who worked in the last store we were in with two cops with him. I was curious as to why he was talking to me. He said "Hey where's the hat you stole from my store?" “I didn't steal a brother hat,” I replied. "@ CAPS1 you did it, we recorded on tape that you had the hat." said the guy. "@ CAPS2 man I didn't take a hat" I replied. "@ CAPS3.k. And your brother, where is he?" the guy asked. I told him where he was and he went there with one of the cops while the other stayed with me while I made a purchase. At this point, I was quite upset that my brother and I were being accused of stealing a hat. The cops started asking me personal questions. I said I wanted to talk to my dad and tell him what was going on. My father was quite upset that my brother and I were charged with theft. My dad was asking me about what had happened, I told him the truth about what had happened. As a cop, my dad and I would come back to watch the movie of the whole incident. We saw my brother come back with the other cop. “ I'm ready to go, the video shows me putting the hat back on the rack, ” my brother said. I was always upset that the guy who worked at the store didn't watch the whole movie, only songs. The guy apologized to my dad and me. I was still angry, because the guy watched the whole movie, and I didn't want people who saw me with the cop to think I was a troubled kid. As my brother and I look back on this experience, we laugh about it and make jokes. There are @ CAPS2 reasons to be angry because we didn't steal the hat and we knew it. Laughter makes us forget. I think without our laughter about it it could have been different. Laughter makes experiences more fun, there is always something to laugh about. It feels like you take a bunch of weight off your shoulder brings you back to life. I could have called the manager to find out how I was feeling and what the guy did with the video, but I forget about it and make a few jokes to make myself laugh.

                                   @ DATE2 I woke up to a very beautiful day. The sky was clear and the sun was shining which was unusual for a day at @ DATE1. I got out of bed as usual. I ate my breakfast, went to the bathroom, and brushed my teeth. I left the house a little tired but great. As I walked to my bus stop I watched people pass by saying @ CAPS4 every now and then. When I got to my bus stop @ CAPS5 was there. I thought maybe the bus had already picked up the children. I waited and waited. Almost fifteen minutes passed. I was starting to worry. If I had missed the bus, I wouldn't have been able to make it to @ ORGANIZATION1. My parents worked until @ TIME1 and there was a @ CAPS5 to take me there. I then decided to walk to the next stop. @ CAPS5 was there too. At that point, I was sure the bus had arrived earlier and left me behind. I started to walk home. When I got there, I opened the door and went to check the @ ORGANIZATION1 calendar on the wall. There was nothing written on @ DATE3. @ CAPS7 was a normal @ ORGANIZATION1 day. @ CAPS2 could I have missed the bus? I never miss the bus! I started to wonder about other possibilities. Maybe there were weather problems and the schools closed. It was not possible because the weather was nice. Maybe something happened to the bus like an accident and @ CAPS7 couldn't come, but it wasn't @ CAPS7 either because then the kids would have been at their bus stops. The more I thought about @ CAPS7, the less @ CAPS7 made sense to me. What was happening that day? I was frustrated. I put my backpack down so I could look up my daily agenda. I opened @ CAPS7 and looked up the phone number for @ ORGANIZATION1. Then I picked up the phone and called @ ORGANIZATION1. “@ CAPS1 has reached @ ORGANIZATION1,” a woman said over the phone. "@ CAPS2 @ MONTH1 Can I help @ CAPS1 ?" "@ CAPS3, I'm a student there and wondering if something was wrong because I didn't see the bus today ?" I said. There was a moment of silence. The woman did not answer me. It made me angry. "@ CAPS4, is @ CAPS1 still there ?" I asked, anger flowing in my voice. Nothing. Then the woman started to laugh. @ CAPS8 laughed for almost a minute. It drove me crazy. What had I said that would make her laugh like that? " Was @ CAPS7 something I said ?" " I asked. “@ CAPS5, @ CAPS5, I'm so sorry,” @ CAPS8 said, trying to keep from laughing. "@ CAPS5, @ CAPS7 is just that, does @ CAPS1 know what day it is today ?" "Isn't @ CAPS7's @ DATE3 @ CAPS7 ?" @ CAPS8 laughed again. "@ CAPS5, today is not @ DATE3, @ CAPS7's @ DATE2." I was shocked to hear this. I had spent all of my time trying to figure out what had happened. The only possibility I hadn't thought of was that @ CAPS7 was @ DATE2. I felt like an idiot. I put the phone down and started laughing. I laughed and laughed like I hadn't done in years.

                                           "Laughs" Laughter is a huge part of my life. I love to laugh, whether it's about something, something, someone, someone, a funny event, a face or just a funny joke. I heard it said once that the more you laugh, the longer you live; if that's true, i will live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it's such a big part of my life. I laugh the most when I'm with my family and friends. They are all very funny people who make jokes whenever they have the chance. There hasn't been a single reunion of family or friends where I haven't laughed. A really fun time in my life that I will never forget is when my sister and I started to get to know our new stepmom, @ CAPS1.We were all playing this game where one person throws a soccer ball in a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the number of points the pitcher calls for. We all got points left and right; however, @ CAPS1 was not that hot. She hatched a plan that she said would win her over. In fact, it ended with all of us on the floor crying laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and shouted "@ NUM1 points !" @ CAPS1 has turned around. My eyes opened wide. Shayna howled with laughter as @ CAPS1 pulled her pants down for us moon. The soccer ball hits the grass, like all of us. I really think this moment brought us all together. I believe laughter brings everyone together. My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it's a very big part of our relationship. Think just a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal ? We can love, cry, hate, and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the only real feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile accompanied by laughter. If you can give someone a reason to laugh, then you've logged in and gone a mile in an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us with ways to reach out through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You-tube is a laughing social network. I put a lot of funny videos on youtube and watched a lot that made me laugh. I once made this video of my friends and I playing @ CAPS5. It was so funny that I thought I would put it on YouTube. I shared it with my mother who laughed loudly. She shared it with her family who shared it with colleagues who shared it with her family and friends. They all laughed. Laughter is everywhere. Laughter can start at a place like @ PERSON1 and reach @ LOCATION1. Laughter isn't always a good thing either. People can go from laughing to a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a child on the playground. Laughter doesn't always feel good if you are laughed at. I don't like to think of laughing this way. I love to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one. Laughing is part of my daily schedule. I would have to write a book to tell you about all the times when laughter has been a part of my life because it happens to me every day. I like to laugh. I hope you too.

 People say "laughter can cure everything" @ CAPS6 you know what I totally believe in. There were a few times that I was sad or angry that someone made me laugh, and I made almost everyone I know laugh when they were frustrated. Now a lot of people have made me laugh throughout my sixteen years of life. To be completely honest, I only really remember one time in my life when laughter was all I needed to bring me back to reality. My best friend @ PERSON2 really knew what I needed to help me. his humor brought my life back to life, and because of that I was able to escape life. It was @ DATE1, when I got really pissed off because I knew the guy I had loved since seventh grade wasn't going to date me anymore. His reason was that he didn't want to ruin our great and close friendship. Just because he said I was going to give up. I tried @ CAPS2 to win it back, but nothing seemed to work. At this point I knew I needed to talk to my best friend so I texted @ PERSON2. I told him @ CAPS2 that I was doing and none of that was working. If you knew @ PERSON2, you would know that @ CAPS1 sees a bright side to anything @ PERSON2 told me at the time, "@ PERSON1, you can have any type in the world, and yet, you don't seem to realize it. I don't know about you, but you must be really sick of @ CAPS3 ! " @ CAPS1 said this once or twice because @ CAPS1 knew it was true. I still couldn't except what @ CAPS1 was telling me. it never stopped me from smiling or laughing. I admit those words really dried my tears. and helped me move forward. Now it's @ DATE2 time, school is out and it's time for me to step up my game. I was always trying to win @ PERSON3, the @ CAPS3 of my life. Again, I tried @ CAPS2 ! I even asked @ PERSON2 to ask @ PERSON3 if he still had feelings for me. He never gave her an answer. When I asked @ PERSON2 for more advice, @ CAPS1 responded as usual. "@ PERSON1, @ PERSON3 is just one guy, there are plenty of guys out there for you. You just need to watch and stop trying for one guy." It made me think. @ CAPS6 @ CAPS1 is absolutely right, I just need to find a guy who makes me feel the same as @ PERSON3 makes me feel. Don't get me wrong though, even though @ PERSON2 was trying to be serious, I couldn't help but smile a little and laugh. As I laughed I thought to myself. I still @ CAPS3 @ PERSON3 like crazy. It's the start of @ DATE2, and I'm just relaxing at home as usual, when I get a text from @ PERSON3 saying he might move to @ LOCATION1. I just started to scream like a hungry baby. I quickly texted @ PERSON2 to let him know, but @ CAPS1 already knew. I had another plan to win back @ PERSON3 and told @ PERSON2 about it. My plan is to ask @ PERSON3 if he wants to hike @ CAPS4. Pisqah with me before he moves. When we walked to the top, I'm going to tell him how I really still feel about him, then I'm going to kiss him m @ CAPS5 @ PERSON2 read this, his first response was : "@ CAPS6 shoot girly, aren't you just a spittoon of @ CAPS3 and romance ! " I almost peed in my pants when I read this. It was hysterical! My plan never happened because @ PERSON3 ended up not moving, luckily. Quintin and I are still not back together, but that's fine with me. His friendship and I have grown considerably. I admit though, I can't help but flirt with him a lot. Luckily I had my best friend @ PERSON2 to talk to. @ CAPS1 is the reason my tears and moans turned into tears of happiness and laughter. The humor of @ PERSON2 led me to ants off. laughter kept me in perspective of @ CAPS2. I owe all my thanks to @ PERSON2, who kept me from going crazy or crazy about @ CAPS2. Laughter has helped me heal my heart and radically change my life.

 I stood up slowly and saw paint dripping from my face, hair and clothes. A trail of paint followed me as I tried to jump from one open spot on the ground to another, but there weren't many open spots. All I could think of was if I was going to do @ CAPS5 in high school, or not. Doing my best to keep the paint off the floor, I carefully opened the door and called. "@ CAPS1 ... Hey mom ?" I shouted half-heartedly, as I glanced around the " painted " room. "@ CAPS2 ?" she cried as she walked up the stairs. My mouth refused to open, I was afraid to answer. I've messed up a million times, but none have been this bad. "@ CAPS3, you see ... I had a paint removed from the paint tray." I replied softly, hoping she wouldn't hear me. "A paint removal?" she asked in a confused tone, as she walked up the stairs to see what had happened. I closed my eyes in fear as she turned the corner. My mind raced as I tried to brace myself for a rant about how I should be more careful and punish. Neither came. She started to crack. I was @ CAPS8 confused at the sight of my mom sitting on the floor, almost peeing in her pants. I then realized that I was probably a sight to see. I was covered in paint from head to toe. I started to laugh when I saw the situation, something like this would only happen to me. A few minutes later, we got our act together and Mom went to get some paper towels to clean up my mess. She came back upstairs with a paper towel roll and a plastic garbage bag. "@ CAPS4 thing I put the plastic coating on everything, before I let you paint." she said smiling at me. "@ CAPS5 would have been a lot worse if I had spilled paint all over the carpet." I replied, smiling back at him. I started to pick up the plastic covering, revealing the unsullied carpet. The trash was as full as a stuffed @ LOCATION1 on @ CAPS6. After collecting the last plastic liner, I slammed the lid of the trash can, putting on the last piece of plastic liner. My mom walked in with @ CAPS7 and a handful of paper towels. "@ CAPS8 what caused the paint tray to suddenly pull out of the paint, @ CAPS9 ?, @ CAPS10 you trip over the plastic liner or drop the brush into the tray ?" she questioned me giving me a confused facial expression. I did not know what to say. "I ... @ CAPS1, @ CAPS3, I was painting the edges against the ceiling, when I took my first step on the ladder and slipped. Land in the paint tray and receive the brush in my face "I didn't mention the fact that I tripped on my shoelace. My mom was still mad at me for leaving my shoes untied. My mom started laughing uncontrollably again. She started to turn red. I couldn't believe his reaction. The situation was @ CAPS8 funny, I started laughing again like- @ CAPS3. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined that someone would forgive me so much. Once we finally stopped laughing, my mom and I finished cleaning up the mess. My mom and I remember that day as a time when we were able to bond. I now realize that my mom will understand and forgive me for my mistakes, no matter how small.

@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 in the school office was a usual thing for me. I was only in elementary school and already had a habit of making myself sick "so I could go home. It had worked several @ CAPS2, but the reality was some adults could outsmart “my disease.” As a child I was a perfect actor, but apparently my acting skills waned. All the staff had discovered me by then and it was now more difficult for me to come out of it. I remember to be in fourth grade when I made an appearance at the office, but not really by choice and in my innocence I never knew what might happen next. My cousin @ PERSON2 and I were in the same classes, we looked alike when we were kids and teachers often confused who we were because we looked like twins. One day my cousin had some math problems and @ PERSON1 our math teacher decided to stay a few minutes after the school to help him. t, we were also taking the same bus and I decided to wait for him to take the bus together Those few minutes became more and once @ PERSON2 got out we already missed the bus. That's when we appeared in the office and there she was the stocky old lady who knew me by heart. I would always remember her sitting in a chair in front of the computer and filling out papers. This time she knew it wasn't one of those "I want to go home" days. "We missed the bus" we said to ourselves, then she asked us why, we both gave our explanations. In the meantime, she called @ PERSON1 to make sure we were telling the truth. When @ PERSON1 showed up, the office lady explained what we said, but the problem was she was confusing our explanations into thinking we both missed the bus for the same reason, pretending to be a liar. When @ PERSON1 heard this she said I was not telling the truth and when I tried to explain to her that the lady was wrong there was no use even my cousin tried to defend me but the office lady said she was sure what I had said. Being a kid and all I was ashamed of even though I knew I was telling the truth. Mrs @ PERSON1 decided to give me a demerit but deep down I knew I had told the truth and that's what matters. As a child, it seems like the end of the world in these situations. Feeling angry because I couldn't do anything about it, but now that I look back it makes me smile because in my bad judgment I could just think the teacher was mean, but now I see that it was just a big misunderstanding. Now about @ NUM1 years have passed and that memory is still with me, but I only get the best out of it. When I hang out with my cousin @ PERSON2 the basis of our conversations are those funny moments from our childhood that just laugh, just remembering the silly things we did when we were young. Sharing these moments brings us closer not only as a family but also as friends and there is nothing better than enjoying long lasting moments of laughter with the people we love.

 Laughter is the key. I think being happy is a big part of life because being happy is so good. If I was in a relationship that wasn't happy, I wouldn't like it at all. In a happy relationship comes laughter, the first thing I do when I meet someone I always smile and tell jokes because if I tell jokes and they laugh, they know I'm a happy person. If you meet anyone, whether it's an adult, a friend, or someone you want to date, they'll always enjoy a laugh. Let's just say my girlfriend and I, when I first saw her she was sitting in a desk in my history class crying and I asked her if she was okay and she told me. told her story after telling me her story, I told her how I felt and then I told her a joke and she laughed. After I finished laughing she asked for my phone number and that night we started dating. I asked her what she liked about me and she responded like I made her laugh. I always love making my family and friends laugh because if they smile it makes me smile. I use laughter as a way to make people feel better about themselves and myself. If the world can learn to laugh and be happy it would be a better place because I would rather laugh and be happy than be angry or sad about something. when i was growing up i was alone all the time so i had to learn to stay happy so i could think of funny things i saw or said in the past and try to make a story out of it and that has worked. I got older, I started doing stand up comedy. It felt good to see everyone laughing. then after the show seeing all the people coming out with big smiles on their faces, it was a night i will never forget that night. If I had to choose what I would like to do for fun, I would be a comedian. Thanks for reading this and have a nice day

 My smile is a mask. It disguises all the past tragedies, future mishaps, and current mistakes - loss. Life is a puzzle that I can't figure out. I am lost, and the more I get lost in life, the more I get lost. Isolate myself from the world, sleep in a bed of handkerchiefs soaked in tears and look at my face in the mirror that I so despise. Laughter or even just a smile goes a long way - too long. It sends the wrong message to those who cannot tell if the mask is real, or perfectly put on. That's the message I want to get across, isn't it? Very quickly, my laughter subsides, my smile diminishes and my lips begin to tremble. I feel like my heart is bleeding and being compressed at the same time. The eyes became wet, they began to sting and redden as if they were infected. Don't ask me if I'm okay, ask to do something for me, or give me a hug. Only pushes me down, which is something that can't be faulted. Peace is all that is needed at the moment; and of course, my best friend, the tissue.

 In ninth grade, I had to give a speech about a book. The speech had to be persuasive, like a TV or radio commercial. I am awful at making speeches. Before speeches, my hands get sweaty and cold, I experience " hot flashes " and I sometimes feel nauseous. During the speeches, my eyes look around the room frantically, my breathing changing to short, rapid breaths. Almost in tune with my looks. At the end of my speeches I start to shake and almost go into shock. I don't speak, I don't laugh, and I want to hide. Fortunately, @ CAPS4's speech was different. My @ CAPS1 class had all girls and one boy. That's not to say I'm sexist, but the fact that the majority of the play is female helped. Girls have a way of accepting, or at least creating a facade of acceptance, and that makes me feel relaxed and calmer. So when the time came for me to get up in front of the room, almost everyone in the class had a slight smile of ambition and eagerness to listen to what I had to say. Everyone looked me in the eye. Compared to the average “ talk time ” classroom setting (when people scribble or speak words to each other), the classroom was zoned on me. Today @ CAPS5 felt like everyone was ready to hear me, no matter what I really had to say and how professional @ CAPS5 was. I felt superior, like I had the power to change their life, almost so superior I could spit propaganda at them and they would eat @ CAPS5 (@ CAPS2 isn't that what advertising is? to a group of people the good things about a product or an idea, and hide the bad things ?). The group looked so innocent. Today I was ready to deliver my speech, just because of that spark of acceptance and a smile. I started. My speech was told with puppets with a cardboard box around @ CAPS5 to serve as a TV. @ CAPS4 also made me feel better because everyone in the audience saw my puppets and all they heard was the voices of the "actors". @ CAPS3 the first lines of the speech, my group of classmates laughed, @ CAPS4 was not what they expected. I'm a shy, calm girl who barely has the courage to raise a hand in class. I wear things like semi-large coats to establish a barrier between myself and the world. Often times when I give speeches people laugh, but usually a negative laugh. The kind of laugh the professor has to silence everyone. @ CAPS5 is also the kind of laugh that makes me shorten my speech, which just makes the speech an introduction and an end, without a body. So for me, coming out of my shell was a big step in what most see as the right direction. The sound of @ CAPS4's laughter prompted me to continue my speech. At the end of my speech, everyone applauded. They always applaud. @ CAPS5 is required to applaud. @ CAPS4 clap was different, @ CAPS5 was applauding for the success of the speaker, an applause that read "@ CAPS4's speech had a clear purpose and made the audience keep listening." @ CAPS5 was not a pitying applause. Then I smiled. My smile showed that I knew I had succeeded. That I got a bunch of people together and focused on listening to what I had to say, and they got it @ CAPS5, and maybe now they would like to read the book. @ CAPS4 was one of the first speeches I ever fully qualified for. The length of the speech was good, not long enough to put the audience to sleep and not fast enough for them to forget the real purpose of the speech. I spelled out all of my words so everyone could understand what I was saying, @ CAPS4 was a big improvement, and also a factor in why they laughed. They could hear my jokes and witty comments. Finally, my puppets also had an introduction, body, and conclusion to their babbling. Usually I get so nervous that I forget to say the body of the speech. Laughter can be mean, cruel, and disrespectful. My story of speech is an example of how laughter can have a positive effect on people. The laughter from the audience was cheerful, cheerful, encouraging and tolerant.

                                 Love in @ LOCATION1 was a little boy, who didn't have much ambition in life, he was mocked and teased to the point that he hid in his house and didn't talk to anyone. The other boys in school would laugh at @ ORGANIZATION1 for being so much smaller than them. He was never the fastest, strongest, or coolest, but he was the smartest. He knew how to twist any sentence to feel superior to others. @ ORGANIZATION1 was in truth alone, he had never laughed or felt the cool touch of a lover. He wished very much that he could be more outgoing to the point where a girl would fall in love with him. There was actually a girl he had been watching for months, her name was @ PERSON1. She was the most beautiful girl he had ever laid eyes on. He had followed her around town and rode his bike in front of her almost every day when she was with her friend @ CAPS1. @ ORGANIZATION1 hated @ CAPS1 because he was with @ PERSON1 every day, and had to hold her and talk to her. @ ORGANIZATION1 had envied @ CAPS1 for about four months before posting him on a website called "myyeabook", a place to meet new people and make new friends. @ ORGANIZATION1 had sent her a friend request and asked her for her numbers. Hoping she would find him attractive and let him text her. @ PERSON1 accepted her request and texted her saying "@ CAPS4, I see you from town next to mine, we should hang out together, that would be cool." @ ORGANIZATION1 had almost lost him when he read this he went for a haircut and some new clothes just to make her think he was attractive and cool. @ PERSON1 had gone to the park with her friend @ PERSON2 and waited for this man named @ ORGANIZATION1. She and @ PERSON2 had played on the swings and spun around on the spinning wheel. @ ORGANIZATION1 had ridden a bike and put it down a hundred yards from where they were. He walked up and said "@ CAPS4". to @ PERSON2 and headed to @ LOCATION2. He told her that he found her beautiful and that she had an incredible smile. @ PERSON1 blushed and asked if he wanted to swing for a while. @ PERSON2 left home, seeing that @ PERSON1 was going to be okay with this guy, and they didn't know they were made for each other. @ ORGANIZATION1 let his guard down and told her jokes, he told his life story almost with her, he was so comfortable with her and he didn't know why. @ PERSON1 felt the same, laughed at his jokes and told him her life story. During this short reunion, they had connected on a level that was far from their age. @ ORGANIZATION1 found that @ PERSON1 was smart and loved being outdoors, she was practically the female version of himself. After a month of conversation and intermittent dating, @ ORGANIZATION1 sent @ PERSON1 a text message saying "@ CAPS6, are you my partner in life ?" @ PERSON1 was stunned and excited that @ ORGANIZATION1 wanted her to be his girlfriend. @ PERSON1 simply replied "@ CAPS6 are you mine?" @ ORGANIZATION1 replied "I love you". @ PERSON1 was the happiest girl in the world that night of @ DATE1, @ NUM1 @ DATE2. The two went everywhere together and did everything together, everyone knew they were perfect for each other. @ PERSON1 started to fall in love with @ ORGANIZATION1 and after four months of being together he finally told her. @ ORGANIZATION1 was so thrilled he went out and bought her a ring, and she graciously accepted it. @ PERSON1 and @ ORGANIZATION1 moved in together and started a family. A little laugh can go a long way, in anything you do, in a job, in a family, or even in the hope of finding the perfect person. @ PERSON1 and @ ORGANIZATION1 found their love came from that day several months ago in this park, laughing at the smallest of things like a cheesy joke or another's adventure can set the stage for a life of true love. All it takes is a little laughing.

 Moving a school is never easy, especially for a fourth grader. I had dreaded going back to a new school all @ DATE2 and the day had come. My @ CAPS1 reassured me as I reluctantly got on the bus. As I scanned the seats, it became obvious to me that I had to try to make new friends or to live my fourth year career alone. The bus ride was quiet, I did not speak to anyone and they did not speak to me. The school day started off like any other. First, the teacher gave everyone their seats in pairs, I sat next to a boy named @ PERSON1. At first I thought my school life would remain lonely, I wasn't sure what my seat partners problem was, but no words were exchanged. The rest of the day passed pretty quickly, before I knew it was over. I had done it though my first day of school. The bus ride home was not much different from the ride to school, as I got off the bus at my house, my mom was there to ask me how my day was going. After telling her everything, she said that I should try to be just myself and eventually make some friends. It was @ DATE1, I woke up that morning with a feeling of renewed motivation. I got ready for the day and waited at my bus stop, waited almost half an hour before going to see my mom. After phoning the school we found out that my bus had had a minor accident so I had to be driven to school that day. My mom was surprised but told me to get in the car and she would take me to school, just as we were coming out of our driveway I noticed that @ PERSON1, my seat partner, waited at her bus stop not caring what had happened. Screaming to stop, my mom rolled down her window to ask if he wanted a ride. At first he seemed uncertain, but he accepted the offer. The car ride was spent in silence, listening to the radio. We went to school and me and @ PERSON1 started walking to class. I don't know what got into me, but I wanted to run down the sidewalk to our classroom. Running down the sidewalk while @ PERSON1 watches, I almost made it to class until one of the teachers decided to open their door. At full speed I ran head first into the door and fell backwards onto the sidewalk. After rubbing a big bump on my head, I turn to see @ PERSON1 laughing hysterically. I got a little angry at first until I thought about it, and it was probably funny to the spectators. Scraping the cement, I walk over to @ PERSON1, we laugh at the incident and head to the classroom. That day we spent the whole class talking, even getting into trouble half of the time. Since that day @ PERSON1 has been a good friend of mine, it's been eight years since we met and there is no end in sight. Overall, in my opinion, laughter is an important part of everyday life and a great way to make friends.

 When I was young my friends and I used to play @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 was a @ CAPS2 in the middle of an orchard, there was a slide, a bored dive and two rope swings. Throughout @ DATE1 we would sit, play, swim and laugh at @ CAPS2. We would have a party from @ CAPS4 and calibrate the @ CAPS5 from @ DATE2 to @ CAPS2. There was a day that I remember so well that it was like yesterday. The last day of school had just ended, my friends and I got on the bus as fast as we could. When the bus pulled up at @ CAPS2 we all started to run and put on our swimsuits. I was the first to enter, therefore I was the first to believe that the water was as cold as the river, I felt like a thousand little nettles were stabbing me over and over again. My friends described me as a bouncing ball because I got out as fast as I got in. As soon as my friends saw my blue lips, they all started laughing so hard that some of them fell into the icy water themselves. After that we drove you to @ CAPS1's house and asked him to turn on the generator. After about an hour the lake was warm enough to swim. After swimming for a bit we decided to go on the swing. After a while we started to jump backwards, when we stopped our back and chest were as red as orchard apples, and the laughter was making our throats sore. Besides having pain from touching the water over and over again, we were also hungry, so we turned on the grill and started making burgers. When the first and second batches looked like a mound of coal, we decided to order a pizza. We spent the time in the fresh air, when the pizza arrived the lake had thousands of sweet air @ CAPS7 floating in it. While we were eating we sat on the small dock and stuck our legs and collected whatever @ CAPS7 was approaching. Shortly after we had eaten we started playing hide and seek in the orchard. After ten or so rounds we were all skinned while running throwing the trees, so sure enough we looked at sodas and cups, to this day I still wonder why we did this because it felt like truly bad. After we were done being stupid, we laughed at ourselves and then laughed at each other. It wasn't long before we were playing swim baseball, the bases were the corners of the docks and the pitcher was on the floating platform. we used floating balls and swam from base to base. Finally the sun started to set and we made a fire next to the @ CAPS2 and toasted marshmallows on it. When @ CAPS9 picked us up, we were in the middle of a flop contest. Before we left, we vowed that we would never forget that day, that we would be friends forever, and that laughter would always be the glue. That night I lay awake all night thinking about all the fun and laughs we had that day, it was definitely the start of one of the best and most memorable summers in my life.

  It was @ CAPS1 @ ORGANIZATION1 from @ DATE1, the sun was shining and the birds were chirping. It was a great @ ORGANIZATION1 to be outside doing something unique to take advantage of the good weather. There was a parade at @ LOCATION1, the parade I was in. I liked to be the center of attention, I liked to be seen; and what better way for that to happen than to be in a parade ? I was with my best friend @ PERSON2 and her family. There was a float for @ ORGANIZATION1. What is the @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 they owned at the time. We had a lot of children on the float, probably around 20. With only @ PERSON2, @ PERSON2's mom and @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 manager to help watch the children. The children were disguised as animals. The older children were handing out candy while the toddlers were on the float. @ PERSON2 and I were laughing the whole time, I almost forgot there were hundreds of people watching us. We were carrying the two twin babies. I no longer remember their names. We have passed out a few times, but most of the time I was holding the boy while she held the girl. They were well behaved babies, they didn't cry often unless we laughed too hard. Or shouted at the crowd too loudly. We ran into a bunch of people we knew. I saw my cousins and some aunts and uncles. I could only wave at them because the parade was moving strangely fast. After a while @ PERSON2 and I started to get tired of holding the baby and walking around. So we stood at the front of the float and leaned against the wooden rail. The rail was only nailed down, so it was not very strong. We thought it would be nice though. The parade continued, we started to get even more tired and hot from the sun. We felt like we could have fallen asleep in front of everyone. We leaned more and more against the exhaustion rail. We were still laughing and having a good time, but became more and more relaxed and found ourselves with all of our weight pushing against the rail. Then we knew the rail had broken and we fell. There were a bunch of people watching and we were still holding the baby's. At the time, I was holding the girl and @ PERSON2 was holding the boy. The boy had just fallen asleep. The babies were fine but the boy started to cry, he wasn't hurt, he was just shocked. It was the most embarrassing moment we have ever had. The crowd started laughing at us and our faces turned red. Baileys' mother came to see us to make sure everything was okay. She handed the baby over to the manager of @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 who was there. Then @ PERSON2's mother helped us up. Then we all burst out laughing. Not only was it the most embarrassing moment of our life, it was also the funniest moment. Our buttocks were sore so we walked awkwardly for the rest of the parade. Once @ PERSON2 even got up on the float and went to lean against the rail again until she realized he was no longer there. At the end of the parade, @ PERSON2's family was waiting for us. Uncle Marks Kids, @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON3, came to us and laughed at us. Dad @ PERSON4 had asked if we were okay. When he asked that @ PERSON2 and I looked at each other and laughed again. Dad just looked puzzled and then joined in our laughter. He was glad we had just laughed at the embarrassment. Then we went home. This @ ORGANIZATION1 was a good @ ORGANIZATION1 for us. We went home and talked about what had happened. We both realized that if we hadn't made fun of ourselves, we probably would have ended up crying in embarrassment. We realized that when something bad happens, it's better to look on the bright side, make a joke about it, or just laugh at yourself. @ PERSON2 and I made fun of ourselves a lot, and laughing at ourselves brought us closer together. Every relationship, whether intimate, family or just friendly, needs a laugh ; or else the difficult things in life will bring you down. Laughter is what keeps you bold and strong. If something embarrassing happens and you don't laugh at it, that embarrassing moment can stay with you forever, and it will affect you in the long run. If you were never going to laugh in a relationship, then it wouldn't be a relationship at all. That is why laughter is very important in everyone's life.

 When I was fourteen I think my family and I started quad biking in the sand. It was my parent friends who made us start riding. The first time I went there I had a four wheeler @ NUM1 @ ORGANIZATION2 and I couldn't help but laugh because it was so small and everyone had big four wheelers and offroad bikes, but riding there with that stuff was fun and my family would laugh every time my brother went up a hill because he just got the shit out of that thing. After this ride, we sold my four-wheeler and got a @ NUM2 @ ORGANIZATION1. It's my first time in the dunes with my new four-wheeler and I can't wait. We arrive at the dunes, unload everything, put on our driving gear and our helmets with our goggles. It was thirty minutes of driving and my brother was hopping on his four wheeler when people showed up and filmed him, which made him show off a bit. So he would jump in front of these people who were going further and further each time. My family couldn't stop smiling and laughing because he was showing everyone trying to jump him. So when he came don't jump, the guys videotaping him came up to us and they said he's really good and we should follow them for another jump. So my brother trying to be cool flogged his bike and wrecked it was funny my dad and I were laughing so hard our eyes were crying but luckily for him my dad and I were the only ones seeing his little crash. So we went to see if it was okay and he said yes so we took off. My brother and I were right behind them and our parents were nowhere in sight. I turned my head to see if they were behind us and when I look ahead all I see is a perch of sand on my face which made me turn my handlebars so I hit a mound of grass and the bike flew up in the air took off from a small hill and landed on my leg my brother didn't know he did this to me so I got stranded until my parents arrive. I don't know why but I couldn't stop laughing because believe it or not this wreck was actually quite funny and funny because no matter what I did I just couldn't get rid of it of this four-wheeled vehicle. About ten minutes went by with my 4x4 on my leg and I finally heard a big noise it was my dad and he came to save me so I told him what happened and he didn't stop to laugh at me. He told me he would get my brother back. So when we were on the way back to the truck my brother was behind my dad and my dad perched him with sand so bad he knocked off his glasses ! My parents and I couldn't stop laughing and ended up stopping so we could stop laughing at my brother. After that, my brother doesn't perch me anymore. It's been a year since we started riding and my brother still hasn't perched me yet. He still has a tendency to show himself. This time my mom's friends came out and my brother was trying to be cool and ride real fast coming out of the dunes and he slipped on the concrete and he wrecked in front of us and maybe like seven people, c was hilarious everyone was laughing next to my mom. He looked at his arm and he had a rash all over his arm. Well I guess that's what he gets for trying to show off. It's like every time he tries to show off his wreckage, so why does he keep doing it? I don't know why, but maybe he should stop someday so he doesn't collapse every time we go out. Just kidding, I don't mind when he breaks down because they're usually funny. I think that's why we have so much fun because of him.

 Have you ever had a friend that when you're around them, you seem like you can't do anything but laugh ? I have, his name is @ PERSON1. Together he and I just spend countless hours joking, smiling and having fun. In any relationship or friendship, laughter is an important quality. In the next few paragraphs, I'll explain why laughter is so important and how it made his friendship and ours so strong and compatible. For starters, @ PERSON1 is my closest friend. We are both very fun and outgoing people. We tend to put our sense of humor at ease in tense situations. This is important because without laughing, you don't enjoy things as much. Someone once told me " for every minute you laugh, it adds a year to your life ." This is important because no one wants to live a short, miserable life. Together we make @ CAPS7 of the worst situations and we get out of it. Laughter is something no one can live without. It's one of those things that can make the biggest change in someone's life, whether it's for a good or even a bad way. Laughter in our relationship is like glue. When things between us got tough, or things in general got tough, we would try to make a joke of it and try to forget what was wrong. One of the ways our sense of humor came in handy when we found out it was going to be rolled out. If you've never experienced this before, let me tell you, it's hard. I remember everything that day I was outside fixing our fence when I got a call from @ CAPS1. When I answered his voice was shy and shaken, I had never heard him sound like that before. He then told me that he was coming and that he had something to tell me. At first I wasn't too worried because he tends to joke and almost never seriously, this time I was wrong. In less than twenty minutes, I could hear the roar of its red diesel firing up our driveway. When he got to the door, instead of entering as usual, he knocked. To my surprise, as he looked up at the head, his face was as red as a cherry, his eyes swollen and teary, and his voice was shaking with sadness. I knew then that it was serious. After three miserable hours of sobs and hugs, he explained to me that he would be leaving in four days at @ LOCATION1. To take it all at once was difficult. I knew he was in the military but I guess I never thought that day would come. Finally, we started talking about more and more the exact details. We then started to find @ ORGANIZATION1 things that he could find there that would remind him of his home. It turned into a day of jokes. Our first mission was to find a failed @ CAPS2 @ ORGANIZATION2. Our second mission, @ CAPS3- @ CAPS4, another failure. And finally our third mission, was to find everything that reminded him of me. We came to the conclusion that our @ CAPS7 idea would be @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6. In return, we got on his truck ad and went to @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 and bought two high tech cameras @ CAPS5 and went home to set them up. It was in itself a memory that I will never forget. When the day finally ended, we realized that yes, it would be difficult for us, but we wouldn't let it break us. We then spent the next four days doing things that he convinced himself "that he @ MONTH1 will never be able to do again." We spent hours playing @ CAPS9-box, hours playing football in the backyard, and even hours playing in a park swinging and sliding. The reality is, without laughter and fun, we probably wouldn't have been able to face it. To this day, we are still planning a specific time and “@ CAPS6 it up” together. In conclusion, even if the going gets tough and bossy, there is always a loophole. This escape for me and my friend @ CAPS7 is laughter. When the worst comes to the worst, turn on your favorite cartoon, call the person who can always make you laugh, spend hours doing unnecessary but fun things, enjoy what you have on hand and laugh, you @ MONS1 never know when these things can get up and go.

We say a lot of things to bring people together. These things can vary from favorite foods to fashion tastes or even disliking the same people, but nothing can bring two people together as much as a good laugh can. Laughter will always relax the mood, bring out a winning smile and from time to time, a tear in the eye. Laughter makes bad days manageable and big days great. From my perspective, the world wouldn't turn around without a good laugh every now and then. By ' good laugh ' I @ CAPS5 don't mean the kind that makes you happy for a moment, I mean the kind that brings tears to your eyes and makes your stomach feel shaky. The kind of laughter you remember. I had a lot of these moments, but one that I cherish the most happened during a school day. A few weeks ago I was having a pretty good day sure it's @ CAPS1 so the weather cooled me down a bit but I was fine. I had my normal classes, had my average workload, then it was time for @ CAPS2. @ CAPS2 is basically a study room in my school. I am sitting at a round table with a few of my friends and we are talking about almost everything. Every day I sit next to @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 and I sometimes sit down and talk with everyone, but we tend to separate ourselves from others and lock ourselves in our own world deprived of jokes, smart laughs and people watching. So that day during @ CAPS2 I can't quite remember what we were talking about at our table, we just couldn't help but laugh. Most of the laughs were just giggles, and some of them were raw, red-faced laughs. After we all calmed down from the last roar of laughter, @ PERSON1 started talking. She sort of spat out the words, "@ CAPS4 guys! You hurt my eyes!" among the laughter that still blooms from his mouth. After she said that, I became puzzled. I just looked at her and stammered, "... what?" I was sure she had made a mistake and said eyes instead of stomach, but after responding with "@ CAPS5, your eyes don't hurt when you laugh really hard ?!" I lost control. I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe and felt like I was going to pee! See, the fun part is that @ PERSON1 is @ CAPS6. So the thought of his eyes hurting from laughing is just out of hand. After @ PERSON1 and I caught our breath, we asked other @ CAPS7 in the room if their eyes hurt when they laugh and guess what ? They @ CAPS8 ! It only made us laugh harder. This opportunity instantly became another joke that we treasure. This joke is by far one of the funniest, and it's fun, makes it even funnier ! Every time she laughs I ask, "@ CAPS8, do you have eye pain ?" and we just burst out laughing. The idea of the joke alone makes me smile, which is why laughter is such a big part of our world. It brings happiness, joy and love. Well, it actually pretty much brings all the positive emotions to it. I @ MONTH1 am not a doctor yet, but I know I am right when I say; everyone should have their daily dose of laughter. Laughter can heal just about anything.

 It was @ DATE1 and my friend @ PERSON1 was going home with @ CAPS2. We talked about our plans for the week all @ DATE1 to @ DATE1. Some of our ideas we had imagined included going to the movies, hanging out at my house and doing our nails while telling stories, or going on an adventure in my neighborhood. At lunch this @ DATE1, we decided to try to brainstorm all the ideas because we had @ DATE1 days to hang out. After lunch we went to our next two classes and classes seemed to go very slowly. Finally the @ DATE1 @ DATE1 bell rang and @ PERSON1 and I ran to our locker to find each other and collect all of our things to get home. We walked out of the front doors of @ DATE1 and waited for my mom on the porch. We waited twenty minutes on @ DATE1 we remembered my mom told @ CAPS2 we had to walk home after @ DATE1 because she had to work late. @ PERSON1 and I looked at each other and started to laugh, because we totally forgot to have to walk home. Finally, we stopped laughing and got up to walk home. On the way home we had taken out my i-pod and the volume was on max so we could listen to music and dance. We finally got home and dropped off all of our things and had something to drink. On our way to my mom's work, we stopped at the local gas station for something to eat. We left the gas station and continued my mother's work. On the way to the bank where my mother works, we came across a dog chasing a squirrel. The dog was running so fast that the fur on his face was pushed back and it looked like he was going to tear himself off. The squirrel climbed up a nearby tree, but the dog didn't realize he couldn't climb the trunk and ended up running head first into the tree. @ PERSON1 and I started laughing at the dog because he tripped for a few minutes, then decided to sit down and bark against the tree. We left the dog and the squirrel and continued to the shore. We got to the bank twenty minutes later and spoke to my mom. She gave us some money to go buy a coffee and then she told us to go home. On the way back we stopped at @ ORGANIZATION2 and had some coffee. On the way back to my house from @ ORGANIZATION2 we watched people go by and made fun of all the people singing in their cars as they pulled over at the traffic lights. We got home and decided to put a movie there. We watched @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 and ate some popcorn. Every time the little yolks walked into the movie, we laughed because we both thought they were cute. After the movie my parents came home and we had pizza and @ CAPS3. Pepper for dinner. After dinner we played the Wii and then fell asleep. The next @ DATE1 when we woke up my dad made us some pancakes and eggs for breakfast. After breakfast we got ready to leave and my mom took us to the mall. At the mall my mom told @ PERSON1 and I to meet her at the food court around two o'clock. We left my mom and headed to the first store. As we walked towards one of the stores, we saw a guy with a mowhak and a green beard. We looked at each other and started laughing because his beard looked like an upturned @ CAPS4 tree. At @ NUM1-hour, we left to head back to the food court to meet my mom. She bought us @ ORGANIZATION1 and told us if we left now we could go see a movie. We decided to stay another hour and then we left to go home. On the way home, we danced in the backseat and sang all the songs we knew. When we got home we played the Wii until my dad arrived. After my dad got home, we had dinner and then played Wii again. This time when we played the Wii, we played my parents too. Every time it was my mom's turn, we laughed at the way she was getting ready to go bowling. After I finished playing wii @ PERSON1 and I went to my room and talked about all the guys we loved. We laughed at some of our choices because we liked them. We talked for about two hours, then fell asleep. The next @ DATE1 we woke up and ate eggs and toast for breakfast. After breakfast, @ PERSON1 got dressed to come home. After he left we spoke via text message about all the fun we had and how we couldn't wait until tomorrow.

 All the memories I have shared with my friends over the years are marked by the expression of emotion. Usually they include an abundance of laughter and happiness, just enjoying life and being teenagers. But on the other hand, these memories are sometimes tinged with sadness: everyday frustrations, vital playoff games we lost by small margins, or the deaths of important people in our lives. I think these ups and downs are the ones we remember the most because they are accompanied by auditory things (laughter and cry) and our brain recognizes them as more important than a typical day. As children we are very impressionable, so if something makes us extremely happy or unusually sad it is going to have an effect on us and we will be remembered. I think everyone knows that teenagers aren't necessarily the most logical thinkers. Some people think it's genetically programmed into our unborn brains that when we hit our teens we will make some silly decisions and maybe end up in a few trouble. I will speak for my generation by saying that our actions are not always fully thought out and sometimes we just don't have a reason to explain the strange things we do. For example, my friend @ PERSON1 has a peculiar and almost obsessive need to keep her car clean at all times. She washes it several times over the course of the month and is convinced that driving slower helps keep the dirt and debris from her mile-long gravel ride away from the candy-apple red paint on her @ ORGANIZATION 1. I wouldn't mind, except every day after school I go to her house with our other friends, @ CAPS1 and @ PERSON2, to kill pre-workout time. The group is always anxious to leave school because we are tired, hungry and just want to go to her place and relax, but @ PERSON1 never gives in to our persistent begging and is perfectly content to drive at speed. a turtle. One day @ PERSON2 got fed up and said she could probably run faster than @ PERSON1 was driving. @ PERSON1 decided to accept the offer, stopped his car, and @ PERSON2 got out and ran into the driveway next to the car. Soon she was a good distance from us, dancing and jumping towards our destination. However, she quickly changed her mind and since the car was going quite slowly, she climbed on the hood and we continued to drive, slowly. We were about two hundred feet from @ LOCATION1's house, just a little bend before we got there, when @ PERSON1 realized that if his grandparents, who live next door, could see us, then she would be in trouble. She didn't care to enlighten us on the details of her mental observation and suddenly stopped in the middle of the aisle. @ PERSON2 slipped off the hood, as we were only going about eight miles an hour, and the momentum pushed her forward at the trot. She slipped on the gravel road, landed on her rear, jumped on the ground, then came to a stop. Those of us who had stayed in the car were in shock, our mouths open, and we stared at her for the few seconds she sat. She then stood up, turned to us and burst into hysterical laughter. We all heaved a collective sigh and went into a nervous breakdown as well, staying in one place for a good five minutes. We were all on the verge of tears and breathless from the view, we randomly laughed together the rest of the day and told all of our other friends about it. We realized it was a stupid thing to do, and @ PERSON2 could have been hurt. But she wasn't, so we all shared the camaraderie of the moment. Laughter has this ability to connect people. You have to make an effort to make someone laugh, to trigger the emotional trigger in them that tells their brain : “ @ CAPS2, I'm having fun. » @ CAPS3 crying is a sign of extreme sadness, laughter is a sign of joy and elation, an indication of happiness. It shows that you appreciate what you do and want those around you to recognize it. I really enjoy my memories that involve laughter, and when I think about those memories, I always laugh again. I think laughter is one of the few simple joys in life. You don't have to spend money or drive somewhere, there is hardly any expense. It's timeless, simple, fun.

 During @ DATE1 of 6th year @ CAPS4, the parents decided they would get a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at @ CAPS4 @ PERSON1's best friend. "@ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 father" @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 told me over the phone. "@ CAPS6 @ CAPS5, @ CAPS8 of @ CAPS9 ?" I asked him. "@ CAPS10 must come home, @ CAPS10 @ CAPS18 served me today with the divorce papers." @ CAPS12 told me. I could feel the tears start to swell @ CAPS9 in @ CAPS4's eyes. I had no idea @ CAPS8 was happening, I was only @ NUM1 and vaguely knew @ CAPS8 divorce was. Without saying a word to him, I hung up @ CAPS9's phone and ran into @ PERSON1's room. I knew divorce would make a difference for me, but I didn't realize it to measure @ CAPS8. I stayed at @ LOCATION1 for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see @ CAPS4 @ CAPS18 or @ CAPS4 father. At night I spoke of @ CAPS8 @ CAPS4 sisters were going through, the horror they must have endured while I was gone. I was wondering @ CAPS8 @ CAPS4 father was doing, where @ CAPS4 @ CAPS18 was, and if @ CAPS4 sisters were @ CAPS13. Even though I knew I should have gone home at some point in those two weeks, I didn't. During those two weeks at @ LOCATION1, I felt safe, but not once did I feel happy. It was an emotion I had dreamed of, but all the times I tried to smile, to try to laugh, to try to be myself, I couldn't. I knew something had changed in me when I hooked up the @ CAPS9 phone to @ CAPS4's dad. I had never hooked @ CAPS9 to anyone before. It was something I knew I shouldn't have done, but I was so upset that I did it anyway. When @ CAPS4 @ CAPS18 picked me up @ CAPS9 after an extended two week stay of @ CAPS4 at @ LOCATION1, she looked worriedly in my eyes. I had never seen this emotion in @ CAPS4 @ CAPS18 before. She was generally so calm and in control. I had never seen her so worried or upset. I knew she was worried about me. I also knew that @ CAPS14 from @ PERSON1 had called mine several times during @ CAPS4's stay. Guess she told him how I act, but @ CAPS8 was I supposed to ? The parents of @ CAPS4 were separating from @ CAPS9 ! @ CAPS4 all life was flushed down the toilet. I knew nothing would ever be the same again and it killed me inside. No one spoke on the way home. I could feel the tension building as we turned down the street @ CAPS4 and drove home @ CAPS4. When we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car and ran into the @ CAPS4 room, leaving the @ CAPS4 items in the backseat of the sedan. For two days, I neither ate nor slept. I just lay down in @ CAPS4's bed hoping @ CAPS4's dad comes home. I had never gone to bed without @ CAPS4's dad tucking me in, never woke up @ CAPS9 in @ TIME1 on @ CAPS4 clean. There was so much that @ CAPS4's dad did that @ CAPS12 wasn't around to do anymore. Things didn't start to improve until @ CAPS4 @ CAPS18 sent me with my sisters @ CAPS4 in the house @ CAPS4 @ CAPS15 at @ LOCATION2. I don't know why, but when I was there I felt the same sense of security and safety I felt when I was at @ LOCATION1. Even though I felt safe, it still wasn't the same. It had been several weeks since I visited @ PERSON1, and I was dying to return home. I knew this was the only place I could actually recover from @ CAPS8 that was happening. @ CAPS4 @ CAPS15 The house was nice and everything, but I didn't feel like home, I didn't think that everywhere I stayed I would feel good. All I knew was that I needed @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5, not @ CAPS4 @ CAPS17 or @ CAPS4 @ CAPS18, just @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5, and maybe @ PERSON1. When I got home @ CAPS4 @ CAPS15, I made arrangements to go home @ LOCATION1. I knew I would be staying a while, so I packed a little more. When I got there I told her @ CAPS8 was going and how the @ CAPS4 sisters were doing. The night I arrived we decided to go to the river the next day. I thought it was a good idea. The next day we went to the river, his brothers decided to join us. His brother @ PERSON2 wanted to prove to us how human @ CAPS12 was, so @ CAPS12 jumped off the biggest rock in the river. I thought it would be a perfect cannonball, but it wasn't. @ CAPS12 landed face down for the perfect stomach flop. I couldn't contain myself, I burst out laughing, I don't think I stopped laughing for several minutes. It was by far the best day I have had since the day @ CAPS4's dad called me at @ LOCATION1.

 @ CAPS10 did you laugh today? Many believe that laughing is beneficial in our everyday life. @ CAPS10, you have heard the saying "laughter is the best medicine". @ CAPS1 comes from the idea that having a positive mood will make you feel better. Close to the idea of @ CAPS2. Laughter has been said to relieve stress and make you appear more accessible to someone you don't yet know @ MONTH1. The quote "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people" is correct in my opinion. I relate @ CAPS1 to the way my friends and I act and the way I act towards strangers. When you meet someone new, making a joke or laughing breaks the ice and can make the conversation lighter and easier. When I was younger my best friend was called @ PERSON1 and we hung out almost every day after school. We shared everything, we had the same favorite color, the same hair, we even had the same friends. We were girls that everyone was sister because we hung out so much. We were the kind of friends who could look at each other and start laughing as they thought of a past memory we had. Like the time we went to the wrong movie or the time we went to lunch together. I remember going to lunch like @ CAPS1 was just the other day, when @ CAPS1 was easily years ago. One day we went to our daily kindergarten class together as always, except today @ PERSON1 was going home with me and my @ CAPS3. My @ CAPS3 knew she was going to have to take the car to the store that day and told us we could keep up and if we were good we would go out for lunch. All day we were on our best behavior because we wanted to go to lunch and then hang out for the rest of the day. @ CAPS1 was at lunch time and my @ CAPS3 was like, well the car will take a while, so I'll take the girls to lunch, then we'll go get @ CAPS1 on the way back. So we dropped the car off and headed to @ ORGANIZATION1's (a local restaurant @ CAPS6) for a lunch @ CAPS7. When we got to the restaurant they took our drink orders and I decided @ CAPS1 would be a good idea to get a big blackberry slushy type drink. When @ CAPS1 came to our table I was really excited and started drinking @ CAPS1 very quickly. maybe a little too fast. When all of a sudden "whoosh" @ CAPS1 spread all over my face and clothes, @ CAPS1 was all over my hair, in my face, in my eyes. I was so embarrassed. I was so surprised at how quickly the ice cream fell on my face that I started to cry right in front of my best friend. She was trying so hard not to laugh, she had the biggest smile on her face. When I looked at my @ CAPS3 was laughing too, I was humbled. I was so scared that my friend and my @ CAPS3 would laugh at me for being so awkward, but they both said that @ CAPS1 had happened to them too. After I cleaned myself up, I realized how stupid I had been. I was so embarrassed at the time and they laughed at me. But when I thought of @ CAPS1, I also laughed with @ CAPS10. The whole drive home we laughed about my little drinking disaster and could barely look at each other without saying something about my spill, or we both thought @ CAPS1 and started over to crack. Even though at first I thought she was laughing at me and laughing at me for having such a stupid accident, we ended up laughing together and @ CAPS1 brought us closer as friends. Our memories of when we were little girls last in our minds and we remember the silly and creative things we used to do and the little things that would be fun for us. We were and always will be great friends. We're still best friends and every once in a while one of us will bring up something that reminds us of that day we were little girls and we'll laugh out loud again. I believe laughter is the best medicine. Even though of course laughter is never going to be the best or cure disease or cancer fight, I think @ CAPS1 makes you stronger to go through the treatment if you are happy and @ CAPS10 a positive attitude, if you @ CAPS10 something to hope too, something you don't have. I don't want to miss it. Laughter can make a sick person forget their illness, @ CAPS1 can make them carefree and live in the moment. I think laughter is so much more powerful than you think. So think about this question instead : @ CAPS10, did you make anyone laugh today ?

        Family trip @ CAPS1 on @ DATE1 my family and I decided to take a trip to @ LOCATION2. My father, who had just woken up from a comma, was in a state of depression. The doctor recommended that my mom start planning family activities and doing some during the @ DATE1 break. I was twelve at the time and noticed how my dad dealt with the fact that he had both lost his arms. He tried to hide the fact that it was too much for him to handle, but it only made us worry more about his health. My mom, sister @ CAPS2 and I decided to go on a trip - to distract my dad - and hopefully get him out of his depression. On the day of the trip, we left the apartments around @ NUM1 hours. My mom was the kind of person who would always be one step ahead of everything. During the night, we had packed our bags and already had things in the car. Since we lived in the upper apartments, my mother and I would help my father - since he had no way of keeping his balance - going down the stairs. He didn't seem enthusiastic about the whole trip, but I made sure to excite my sisters and they continued to talk to my dad in the car. A few hours later, one by one my sisters began to fall asleep and then my father began to sleep. My mom was starting to doze off, so I lay awake and started talking to her about random topics. As I held her company, she began to tell me stories about his childhood - the laughter she had when his cousins were made jokes - and so on. Some of the stories were so funny that we tried not to wake everyone up with our laughs. Even though she had lived a difficult childhood, her cousin @ PERSON2 was the one who had always made her laugh. My dad and sisters woke up and started getting motion sickness, so my mom ended up going out to @ LOCATION3, @ LOCATION1. As we were looking for a gas station we started to hear loud music and as we got closer we noticed that there was a carnival in the middle of the city. My sister @ CAPS2 who was @ NUM2 at the time started complaining with @ PERSON1 who was 8 years old. I tried to convince my parents and my mother agreed but my father only got angry. That was until my sister @ CAPS4 who was @ NUM3 years old started fuming indefinitely, until my dad finally agreed. My mom parked the car in the nearby park and my sisters ran past us to the carnival. My mom tried to catch up with them while I locked the car from the inside. Arriving at the carnival, we saw stalls filled with jewelry, clothing, and other small items. We continued to walk and saw a group of gypsies dancing on stage. Later a comedian came on and he made everyone in the audience laugh. After looking at the gypsies and the comedian, we started to look around us. We ended up buying three umbrellas @ CAPS5 and the fourth umbrella was free. We thanked the saleswoman by opening our umbrellas for some shade. The heat @ DATE1 was starting to get worse so we headed for the car. When we got to the car my mother's face turned pale, she had left the car keys inside. She started arguing with me and I started to regret the whole trip. I was exhausted and didn't want to argue. My dad finally interrupted, telling us he was going to get a wire hanger from one of the carnival stalls. As he left with my sister @ PERSON1, the rest of us started walking towards the park. @ CAPS4 started to sulk and my mom kept blaming me for locking the car, meanwhile I pretended to be deaf. After my dad came back with a wire hanger, I started straightening it and bending one side to create a hook. After many tries, I still couldn't open the car and my arms started to hurt. An older couple on a motorbike parked next to us and asked us what we were doing. My dad told them we left the keys inside the car. The old man helped us open one of the car doors. We thanked him and said goodbye as we got into the car. We decided to go home, exhausted from the whole trip. Even though the destination had changed, we enjoyed the trip and everyone quickly forgot about the incident with the keys. My mom and sisters started joking, and for the first time since I was released from the hospital, my dad started laughing.

 I think laughter is good for relationships and here's why. When I got to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 I was trying to be myself and make friends. One day I was in class and @ CAPS4 walked into my classroom and came up to me and she started talking to me and I started to laugh. She told me that she liked my laughter so she started to laugh like me. To make me laugh more, a @ CAPS5 felt good knowing she was laughing at my laughter, she was enjoying @ CAPS5. She was trying to make me laugh because she thought @ CAPS5 was funny because she had never heard anyone laugh like that. Everyone has a different laugh, I have two laughs that she found funny. @ CAPS5 was the best day of my life because I was myself and I know she wasn't laughing at me. Every time she hears me laugh she laughs and tries to make me laugh so she can laugh and we all have a good time. To me @ CAPS5 is funny because a lot of people don't notice how other people laugh. @ CAPS5 feels good to have noticed and liked @ CAPS5 and want to have a good time. Most people when they laugh at someone say hurtful things @ CAPS4 wanted to make me laugh again I know she wasn't laughing at me. She just thought @ CAPS5 was unique and funny but not haha you're funny but weird as omg I love your laugh is cute and funny. Now every time she sees me she tries to make me laugh @ CAPS5 makes me feel good every time she does @ CAPS5. To be honest @ CAPS5 made me feel like people surprisingly loved me and didn't know me as "the new kid" but as a human being a real person and were telling me for me not for who i want to be or for what people see me as. That's all I could really ask for. So my opinion is yes laughter is good for relationships @ CAPS5 shows that you have a sense of humor and that there is a real person inside that body, not just bones. Another reason is that @ CAPS5 shows your personality your real self. Isn't that what people want people to see them for who they are, not what people say they are. At least that's what I want. this is why I will never forget this period of school. @ CAPS4 showed me that if i just laugh with other people i wouldn't know that they don't laugh at me like laugh at me they say I'm funny. This is what people want is to see people for who they are. The teacher was a substitute for that day and she kept getting mad at us for laughing, but we couldn't help @ CAPS5 because @ CAPS5 was so funny. This period, I laughed all the time. I was laughing so much @ CAPS8 that I did a little weed in my pants. She was making fishy faces and sounds like she was pretending to be a monkey in a tree. She laughed as I laughed she did everything to make me laugh. @ CAPS5 was so funny @ CAPS5 took the whole period. That's how I laughed. I got up and was going to go to the bathroom and when I came back she was still there and I sat down and then she started making me laugh. So I sat down and @ CAPS7 and @ PERSON1 came in and there was something in his pocket and I pushed @ CAPS5 and said what the hell is @ CAPS8. We all started laughing because @ CAPS5 was funny @ CAPS5 was his wallet. I didn't understand why they were still laughing when I stopped, but I continued to laugh because of the way they were laughing. We were all laughing then we all stopped at the same time and because we all stopped at the same time we all started laughing because @ CAPS5 was funny. . I think the reason we were laughing was because we were doing stupid stuff. I turned to do my job, then @ CAPS4 spun me around so I started laughing again. Then I started laughing again @ CAPS5 I started to cry. I was laughing then @ CAPS8. @ CAPS4 started laughing then @ CAPS8 she started laughing. At the end of the period, I wanted to pee so badly. @ CAPS4 didn't want to let me go, she kept making me laugh more and more. Sometimes laughing for no reason is the most fun. I guess my whole belief is that laughing is one of the best things a person can do. Not only is @ CAPS5 fun, @ CAPS5 is also a very healthy thing to do.

 I've waited a whole year for @ TIME1's day to come, @ DATE1. Today is my birthday! I can't wait to open the presents and eat the cake. I'm spinning @ NUM1 and all my friends are coming in and everything. It should be a great day! First I have to wait for my mom to come home to @ CAPS2 after work. So today I'm going to go swimming then hike then finally my friends can come and the party begins. We will have games, gifts and cakes. My mom said my sister was automatically invited, but I don't like this rule. Maybe the next @ CAPS1 anniversary will be able to uninvite them. My mother is at work. She's gone to @ TIME1 and my sister and I just had breakfast now we're going for a swim. We have a pool just off the patio in the front yard. Sometimes when my sister is angry she just throws me into it. Other times she does it just because she's taller than me and she can. My older sister @ PERSON1 friend @ PERSON2 was spending the week with us because she had moved during @ DATE2 and decided she would come visit us. It was then that they decided to start throwing me in the pool. One was still grabbing my legs, the other grabbing my arms and they were swinging me until they threw me into the pool. Well I got mad after it kept happening and had a fit and cried. @ PERSON1 told me if I was going to act like a baby then I deserved to be treated like one so she put me in a diaper and in the high chair and forced me to eat food for baby. Of course I was crying now because I don't like baby food and being in a high chair or being put in a diaper. At @ TIME1 I didn't want to hike and just wanted my mom to be home. Finally, my mom was at home and even better, she brought pizzas. I was so excited she did it because all my friends were coming and the pizza was perfect. My mom changed her work clothes and then decided it was time for me to take a nap. Well I'm @ NUM1 I don't need to take a nap so that's when I knew something was going on. now that i've decided it's @ CAPS3 i went for a nap and really fell asleep. my mom at @ TIME1 cleaned, decorated and picked up all my friends. when I woke up and walked out of the living room mom and all my friends screamed "surprise" and I was really surprised. After a long fun party, it was time for us to clean up and put all the trash and cake on top so that no flies did @ CAPS2. The next day my mom went back to work and I swam and played all day! It was a great day wearing my new swimsuit and also playing with my new floating toys that I received. I have a lot of @ DATE2 stuff. then my little sister and I @ PERSON3 were trying to find a way to get hot water @ CAPS2 in the pool, but we had problems because the house did not match the faucet in the bathroom. that's when we went to my mom's room and used the tub and put the hose all the way through the back door. We definitely accomplished this mission! At @ TIME1 times we heard alot of craziness and I went to see what was going on and it was all smoky. I went into the kitchen and my sister screamed "@ CAPS2 your sisters and @ CAPS2 outside the house meet you on the road" I ran and picked them up, then saw fire trucks speeding up 'gone and here is my mom racing and she was freaking out making sure everyone was @ CAPS3. In the end, I found out that she had burned my birthday cake while trying to preheat the pizza. I was a little upset that it was burnt, but now I'm @ CAPS3 with it because I'm looking back and laughing because my sister at @ TIME1 day still has the burnt spoon and lock. the lock is on our door, it was just a dummy lock and the fire department didn't know it, so they just cut the chains. Guess the lesson learned here is that before you preheat the top you should always make sure there is nothing in it.

 Sportswear @ CAPS1 People say laughter can bring anyone together. I don't know if this is true but, I know that it can bring together two very unlikely @ CAPS1. My best friend and I are completely opposed, but we became the best @ CAPS1 because of a simple joke in the locker room. It happened on a @ TIME1 which was not going well for me or for her. It was @ DATE1 @ TIME1 I had to go to school. I woke up late just missed it, walked to school, and already dropped my lunch in the hallway about three times when, I walked straight into @ PERSON1. (my future best friend) "@ CAPS2 where are you going." she said huskily and gave me a sharp look. Me being shy, I just lowered my head and continued to walk. @ PERSON1 was one of the prettiest girls in school hanging out with the "In" I clique, well I didn't. Most of the time I was hanging out on my own. His @ TIME1 had gone about as well as mine. Her @ CAPS3 had broken up with her, for her best friend, at the time, she too had spent the night in the hospital with her brother who had been in a car accident. So she was in the same mood as me. What was even worse was that our next class was @ CAPS4.E. ! I walked into the locker room and as soon as I walked in I realized I had forgotten my workout clothes. @ PERSON1 had just entered behind me and by the sigh she gave, I knew she had forgotten hers. We were going to have to use the bucket ... The bucket was where all the lost or unwanted items ended up @ CAPS5 there was cool stuff like neat @ CAPS5 sweatshirts and tees but you never could be sure if they were clean. Today however, it seemed that there were only guys' clothes. I walked over to the bucket and @ PERSON1 came up beside me. We both started digging in the bucket. Finding nothing but oversized sweatpants and extra large shirts, we @ CAPS6 picked the ones we thought were the best. We changed and as soon as our eyes met we both started to crack. We looked like two little children playing in their father's clothes. She couldn't let go of her pants or else they would fall around her ankles and the shirt I was wearing hung above my knees. Neither of us stopped laughing until our sides hurt and tears rolled down our faces. When the teacher from @ ORGANIZATION1 knocked on the door we walked out of the locker room and the whole gym stared at us, but we had regained trust and friendship with each other so we didn't care. I feel like this day @ PERSON1 and I were glued to each other like the best @ CAPS1. We've been through a lot of fights but every time I think about that day in the locker room I can't help but laugh. This is how laughter made @ PERSON1 and myself to be the best @ CAPS1.

 Imagine this, flying over trees on a @ CAPS1 @ NUM1, a four wheeler trying to follow everyone in front of you. It was like that on New Years Eve. We left the house around @ NUM2 pm. When we left the house we headed to a friend's house as we asked them earlier if they wanted to go. So when we left we had to leave quickly so that we weren't on the road for a long time. When we got to our friends' house we hung out for a bit and then asked them if they still wanted to take a ride with us. They all got ready then around @ NUM2: 45 we all left. All together now, we were about @ TIME1 about to step onto Gillhooly on this ride. When we finally got to the top of the mountain it was around @ NUM4 hours. So we spent some time together until @ NUM5 hours. When I say hangout, I mean we hit some mud holes and played around a bit. By the time we were all muddy it was around @ NUM4: 55 pm. So we set up fireworks to shoot. Then around @ TIME1, we shot them all. There were only about @ TIME1 or @ NUM7 of them. We started heading home towards @ NUM8 in @ TIME2, but a friend of ours got stuck in the snow by the side of the road. We spent about half an hour digging it up before we finally got home. We got home to @ NUM9 in @ TIME2. We all got something to eat because we were all hungry then we looked a bit @ CAPS2 then went to bed for the night.

  I believe laughter is a healthy way to get along with someone and have fun! I think the more you laugh, the more fun you have with someone or a group of people. Once my friend @ PERSON1 and I were hanging out at my house and we literally couldn't stop laughing, every little thing was hilarious for us for some reason ! It makes us so much more fun together, when we can just laugh together instead of fighting. I like to laugh; all my friends call me obnoxious because i laugh all the time. I feel like if you laugh and laugh with someone it brings you closer together and it's a lot healthier and better if you just laugh ! For example, I always want to date @ PERSON1 because we always laugh together and have a good time. It's like when you have a group of friends and some of them are always at odds on something or you have an argument, it's never fun. If you have a boyfriend / girlfriend and you always laugh with them, it makes you want to be with them even more because you are having a great time. Fighting does just the opposite! I recently realized who my good friends are and who my bad friends are. Laughter is the greatest quality to have in someone. The girls I fight with are usually the ones that don't have a personality and are very negative and are just crazy. My friends who I get along with, we always laugh and have a good time, the only time I argue with one of my good friends is because downers always say random stuff that isn't. not real and hurtful for that person to make him be there with you ! I realized that the more you laugh, the more fun you will have and the more people will want to be around you! I also noticed that my mom and dad are completely different people. My mom is a darling who always laughs and I can always have fun with it. My father, on the other hand, never laughs. Honestly, I can't remember the last time I heard him laugh. He's so depressing and no one ever wants to be around him. This is probably why my parents are divorced! You can just tell my mom is having more fun and my dad is not. In life, you just have to have fun, do what you're supposed to do, and laugh. So really what I'm trying to say is that laughter is an important part of any relationship; whether with friends, family, anything ! It's definitely a good quality to have. If a person is always happy and still wants to have a good time, I think that's how they are raised. If you think about it, I get my mom @ PERCENT1 time and my dad @ PERCENT1 time. Whenever I'm with my dad I'm always in a bad mood, I never want to do what he asks. I basically want to rebel. When I'm with my mom I literally do the opposite, I'm always happier and will do whatever she wants, and we always laugh and have a much better relationship than my dad and I. I think laughing and being happier has a lot to do with who you admire, how they act and what they do. I can definitely tell my mood swings from parent to parent. It has a lot to do with the way parents raise their children. I think that as an adult you have to be a positive influence on your child / teenager. I think it's good to have a healthy laughing relationship with your child. Life is too short to spend it hating someone, I believe you should spend your life having fun and making your dreams come true, and most importantly, laughing.

 When I was in third grade my parents decided that we should move to where my @ CAPS1 was born and raised and where my @ CAPS2 lived. Me, being a determined third grader, I was angry and told them I wasn't going to move and even sat on the floor and told them I wasn't going. Needless to say, I didn't get very far, but I still wasn't happy to have been taken away from my friends and family side @ CAPS3 that I had known since I was little. My friends were all I had known during my elementary school years and I was far from ready to say goodbye to them. It was very difficult to say goodbye to them even though we came back and visited later. We moved three hours from my hometown. It was a big step forward, especially for a ten-year-old who had never really been anywhere else. Being a new student is never easy. Especially with a shy and calm personality like mine and the first day was scary. I remember it very well. I walked in with my @ CAPS4 and my new teacher was in the office at the time, so she took me into the classroom and showed me around the school. I was still scared and upset that my parents would give me this huge change. When class started, the teacher made me stand up in front of the class and told them about myself. I've never been a great speaker and it's hard to believe I stood there and talked about myself. I can't even do that very well today, and I'm a lot less shy than I was then. It was terrifying to say the least even more when I finished speaking and the class sat in dead silence. Then I slowly walked to my seat and being the shy person that I am, I didn't speak the rest of the time until lunch. At lunch, a little girl with freckles and glasses, like me, came to sit with me. Once she broke my shy exterior, we laughed and played and had a great time. And for the first time that day, I thought moving could be a good thing. Me and she became great friends with the other girls she was dating. We sat next to each other in class, talked on the phone, had sleepovers, and had recess together every day. She was the first best friend I made when I moved and I was glad it was her and not someone else. Today I am so grateful to him for taking the time to get to know me when I was shy at first and for not saying much because I know what it's like to approach someone you don't know. The laughter we shared that first day at lunch and his willingness to break through my walls of shyness really brought us together. Without her on that first day, I don't know how the rest of that day or that week would have been. Without people like her who are ready to make a new friend, the first lonely days would have been for me. Laughter is an important part of a relationship because it brings people together and shows that even if you don't know someone very well, you can still have a good time. The rest of that day is a better memory as we shared laughs and became friends. It made the move to a new school less scary and helped me find a place to fit in.

                                         "@ CAPS1 to @ CAPS2" @ CAPS3 have you ever seen the little signs that say "@ CAPS4, @ CAPS5, @ CAPS2" ? The @ CAPS3 people often come to their homes to remember how to @ CAPS4 their lives. Well, I believe that laughter is one of the most important things you need to @ CAPS4 in your life to the fullest. Laughter keeps the soul young, the heart happy, and the mind happy. Seriously, a @ MONTH1 feels like he @ CAPS3 has a void inside that he is unable to fill. Laughter has played a huge role in my life and has created some of the best memories. If Luaghter was not a part of me, my life would be like a house without furniture; empty, boring and above all unnecessary. Some memories will never leave my mind, and in hindsight, I continue to @ CAPS2 my brains out. My favorite and most hilarious memory I can think of happened about two years ago with my grandparents. My family and I were staying with my grandparents for the weekend at their house at @ CAPS7 which I absolutely loved as there was so much to do there! They had go-karts, golf carts, an area and a gigantic pool! What more could anyone want? The weather was always nice and warm so I had no complaints. It was a lovely evening, my brother, his best friend, and I decided to go for a ride with the golf carts. My brother was in his own golf cart and I was with his friend @ PERSON1. Now @ ORGANIZATION1 must @ CAPS3 seen something on the road because he told me to stop and then he jumped. As he strolled oddly towards the front of the golf cart, I gently stepped on the accelerator, moving forward in a quick fashion, just to scare him a bit. While I was doing this, he jumped frantically on the hood like a cat that just got scared. So I decided to put the brakes on, and when that happened @ PERSON1 launched like a rocket, but then tried to get back on the hood. Guess you could say we developed a game. I would go a few inches or so and then hit the brakes ! At that point, I was practically crying from laughing so hard. This is until something very unexpected happens ... I drove fast then pulled to a stop really quickly but in doing so this time @ PERSON1 tripped ! I didn't notice him because I was driving carelessly like a maniac, but pretty soon the golf cart was on him! All I remember hearing was a @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 ! then a loud shrill. He was lying face down, cart on his back, and I didn't know what to do! My heart raced quickly and a rush of fear washed over me. I looked to my right to find my brother who was rolling on his back laughing like a hyena! I was still sitting in the golf cart, still unable to move in my shock. My brother finally got up and @ PERSON1 was screaming : "@ CAPS10 don't move @ CAPS11 !" @ CAPS12 I had to do something ! My brother was trying to tell me that we had to lift the heavy cart off his back, but in my head I knew we both wouldn't be together @ CAPS3 able to do it. Taking matters into my own hands, I reversed very carefully and slowly. Biting my lower lip, closing my eyes firmly, I hammered the gas to the ground, flying back out of his defenseless body. Fortunately, no damage was done and @ ORGANIZATION1 was doing perfectly fine. A gigantic weight was lifted from my back and I was able to breathe again. Looking back I am able to @ CAPS2 and joke about this wonderful day that went so wonderfully wrong, although I am very grateful that nothing extremely harmful has happened to the poor guy I so terribly crushed That day. I can tell you one thing, as the day went on we had a blast. To be carelessly the big adolescents that we are, and without any worry in the world ; we laughed, swam, drove the golf carts and enjoyed the wind that lifted our hair, then down, then all around. I take two things away from this crazy day. First, make smart decisions and prepare for the consequences you will face @ MONTH1 and second, enjoy your life. @ CAPS2 as if there was no tomorrow. Be carefree but careful, and enjoy every second ! I learned this in the face of a difficult decision; for example ... do I get rid of my friend brother ? Or do I keep just sitting here and listening to him scream? In this case, I took a big leap of faith and followed my instincts. Which I believe was definitely the right decision. Follow your instincts in life, and @ CAPS1 to @ CAPS2.

                                                  Laughter Laughter, how do you define it? The inexistence of happiness? Seriously, @ CAPS1 wouldn't be a smile. Without smiles, @ CAPS1 wouldn't be affectionate. Without affection, @ CAPS1 wouldn't be an emotion. Without emotion, @ CAPS1 wouldn't be a reaction. Without a reaction, everyone around you would be empty. To laugh; he can do so many things. It can bring people together or even separate them. This can be a way for @ CAPS2 to express yourself, or even a way for @ CAPS2 to put up "your walls". Laughter can mean so many different things. He can show so many different things. He can show so many emotions, even hide them. For example : @ CAPS1 are those people who laugh when they cry, when @ CAPS1 is crazy, when @ CAPS1 is sad ect. But look beyond the picture, why do you think @ CAPS1 is laughing at such times ? When it really isn't the emotion they feel at all. @ CAPS1 isn't laughing because @ CAPS1 is around a happy person. @ CAPS1 laughing @ CAPS2 hides the real pain they feel inside, because whether they like it or not, no human can completely leave "everything in play". @ CAPS2 be so vulnerable that anyone could walk in and cause pain. So how important is @ CAPS2 laughter to you ? In and the type of relationship, laughter is important. Whether it is a friendship, a marriage, an engagement ect. @ CAPS2 knowing how your partner is feeling can make all the difference. So a single laugh or chuckle could change everything. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.

                                Laughs @ CAPS1 us @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 was college's @ DATE1 and the whole music department was going on a field trip @ DATE1. Everyone was heading to @ LOCATION2 for the biggest concert no one had ever attended. Only eighth grade students of the orchestra, choir, jazz orchestra or jazz choir were able to attend ; if @ CAPS16 has not paid all of your funds, then @ CAPS16 has been left behind. We would go to a hotel, go to a concert, and go to a @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5. My friends, @ PERSON3, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON4 were definitely excited. We have never made the longest road trip so far. @ CAPS3 seems to have taken days to get to @ LOCATION2. We left at five in the morning with over a hundred children crammed into two buses. One bus was for boys and one for girls, but there were more girls than boys, so we split the boys' bus. I was stuck sitting with @ CAPS6. @ CAPS6 is a nice girl, but @ CAPS3 was difficult to start conversations with her. @ CAPS17 wanted to be home at @ LOCATION1. I never found out why @ CAPS17 was so upset; which made my trip there incredibly boring. Until the accident of @ PERSON3. @ CAPS17 snorted a pretzel in his nose. Overall @ CAPS17 was doing fine and everyone except @ CAPS6 laughed with her. At the third hour of sitting in a cramped bus, we girls had to go to the bathroom. Complaining to bus driver @ CAPS17 replied, "We're almost at the pit stop. Another hour or so." The girls in the choir started singing about going to the bathroom. Soon the bus was filled with our melodious singing and laughter. Finally @ CAPS8, the bus driver, stopped. A line of dancers came out of the bathroom laughing at each other. Once we were done, we said our goodbyes to the boys as they piled onto the bus and took off. "@ CAPS9 down. Let's go to @ LOCATION2." @ CAPS8 said. We applauded as we left. Four hours later, we were stopped again, at another gas station, eating our lunch. The boys were okay with the progress we had made ; starting to call us girls, boys were getting boring. We girls ignored all calls from the boys for the rest of our trip. Finally we arrived at our hotel. At the hotel, the boys got the upper floor while the girls got the lower floor by the pool. When dinner arrived @ PERSON1, our music director, everyone out loud to walk around the nearby stores and buy our dinners. Fortunately, we were near @ ORGANIZATION3, @ ORGANIZATION1, @ ORGANIZATION2 and many fast food outlets. @ PERSON4 and I went to @ ORGANIZATION1 while @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON2 had our drinks ; since we didn't want @ ORGANIZATION1 drinks they went to @ ORGANIZATION3 to buy @ CAPS11. We ended up in our room with our goods. We force-fed ourselves until our abdomens seemed to explode. Dancing to the bathroom, @ PERSON3 appeared with a broom as a dance partner. Our laughter filled the room. We partied until we realized we had to go to a concert. We had two hours before the concert and thirty dollars was missing. @ PERSON3, @ PERSON2, @ PERSON4 and I searched our room, almost missing breakfast and found ourselves empty-handed. When we found the girls across the hall, all but one were there. The remaining girls looked at each other. “@ CAPS6 ran out of money yesterday and now all of a sudden @ CAPS17 has money to buy food. Fifty dollars are missing.” @ CAPS13 replied. @ PERSON1 then entered, "@ CAPS14 up. We have a concert to attend." @ CAPS15 against each other with disappointment we all left. As I ran to the backstage door, I let my music drop. @ PERSON2 laughed as he picked up @ CAPS3. "@ CAPS16 will do just fine." @ CAPS17 said with a smile. I smiled back, "@ CAPS18 @ CAPS16." I turned and walked out onto the empty stage and sat down in front of the group. Picking up my flute, I started my solo. The sweet chords filled my ears as I imagined myself alone. Although I was nervous, my jitters vanished gracefully. I ran through the auditorium doors. Girls and boys were laughing with me as we rushed to the buses. The bus drivers rushed to the @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5. Once there, @ PERSON1 paid for everyone and we left. Laughing to ourselves @ PERSON3, @ PERSON2, @ PERSON4 and I screamed at the top of our lungs when the shock @ CAPS19 subsided. At the end of the ride we all laughed pretending to have come @ CAPS2. I didn't want to leave, but I knew I had to. Everyone piled onto the bus and called our parents to let them know we were coming home. Laughing at every mistake we made, @ PERSON3, @ PERSON2, @ PERSON4 and I took a group photo to remember the trip. Some how during the trip we laughed about everything together. Nothing stopped us from laughing. At the end laughing @ CAPS1 we @ CAPS2.

 Laughing is one of the best things people can learn to do. Laughing is one of the many things I love to do. I love how everyone has their own distinctive laugh, some are loud and some are silent, almost like giggles. Not only do I like it, but I like it helps me relieve stress, which is an important part of relationships. My boyfriend and I met about three years ago. Today we have been dating for a year and three months. We met while I was mowing my garden and my neighbor @ LOCATION1 brought him in to introduce us. I mean she couldn't have brought it at a worse time; I was hot and sweaty because it was 80 degrees outside, I had no makeup on and smelled of fresh cut grass, what a great first impression eh? "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 is @ PERSON1" she said with a smile. "@ CAPS3 timing @ CAPS4" I replied with an angry tone in my voice. "sorry," she said, "but he said he wanted to meet you, and he wouldn't shut up about it." I looked at him and noticed that he was blushing a bit and I laughed. From that point on, I knew @ PERSON1 and I were going to experience something good together. To this day, our relationship is stronger than ever, and that's because we can make each other laugh. Now don't get me wrong, trust, honesty, communication, listening, is still a big part and that's important too, but I think having a sense of humor and being able to laugh in a relationship is one of the key elements of a healthy and lasting relationship. My boyfriend and I have a great sense of humor and we challenge ourselves to use it in our relationship. I could have the worst day of my life and when I talk to her on the phone I know my day is going to turn from horrible to fantastic. Just because I know in the first few minutes after talking with him and hearing his voice, he's going to say something funny and I can't help but laugh. I honestly believe that you need a good sense of humor in your relationship if you want it to last. When you don't have a laugh in your relationship, it tends to get very boring and boring. You can't be serious around the clock, it's way too stressful. Since laughter helps relieve stress, you'll absolutely need it during your relationship so that it doesn't get stressful and turn into nothing more than a bunch of fights and arguments. So in conclusion, I know that your thoughts on what I just talked about may not be the same, but I hope after reading this that you will be more willing to consider my opinions on the subject of laughter. in a relationship, based on being able to enjoy and know what laughter is, and also how awesome it is. How it relieves stress, if you have a lot of stress in your relationship, try making some jokes, you will be amazed what a little laughter can do. Especially if you want your relationship with your partner to be happy, fun, and not only that, but also full of life. Laughter is happiness

 I don't think people laugh enough today. Laughter is said to be one of the healthiest things around. I've heard that the more you laugh, the longer you live. If that's true, I should live forever! I believe that laughing is really healthy for you. I have a friend who is really sick right now, but when I'm with her I can make her laugh like crazy and it seems to take the pain away. If I could cheer him up @ NUM1 I would be happy to. Yesterday she and I were together and I don't remember what we were talking about but it must have been good because she made me laugh so hard I threw up! I know it doesn't sound like a lot of fun, but even though I had just done this, we were still both laughing. Times like this, I can definitely look back and smile. I love the effect of laughter on people. I sat at a bus stop and laughed or laughed for no reason and the people next to me will start laughing ! It only makes me laugh harder than everyone else does! As long as you're out with friends, or anyone for that matter, and can laugh, it means you're having fun and enjoying the company of others. I don't see the point of being friends with someone who can't at least make you laugh a little. The other day my friend and I were sitting in the car, it was dark, calm and we were just talking. Out of nowhere my mom appears saying, "@ CAPS1 !" (It still happens though.) @ CAPS2 we screamed at the top of our lungs. Guess we should have expected her to do something like that though. After we caught our breath, we both looked at each other to start laughing hysterically at how silly it was. Laughter really brings people together, whether you're strangers or best friends. When you laugh with someone, you usually laugh for the same reason, right ? Just like my friend and I were in the car. This is what I like, because it means that we have things in common.

The @ CAPS1 of @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 I think about the laughter I think about my @ CAPS2, all the things that made me roll on the floor without breathing in my lungs, enjoying the life that @ CAPS4 has given me. We all know that most children find it absolutely funny. @ CAPS3 I was about ten years old, my parents bought me and my siblings a puppy. He was no ordinary puppy, he was the runt of the litter, and he suffered from some sort of mental disorder. Oh, how we loved this puppy. Every day @ CAPS3 I would come home from school, go to the back yard and play with the puppy for hours and hours. We finally found a name for @ CAPS10 a few days later; his name was @ CAPS5. The reason we named @ CAPS10 @ CAPS5 was that @ CAPS9 would literally rock when walking. One day @ CAPS3 I came home from school, took @ CAPS5 to the top of the hill in our backyard, played with @ CAPS10 and was running and laughing. Every time @ CAPS5 came down the hill his little legs get tangled up and @ CAPS9 dives in and starts rolling down the hill until @ CAPS9 can get up, which normally wasn't until @ CAPS9 was at the bottom of the hill. @ CAPS3 @ CAPS9 made my sister and I laugh so hard because it was so cute and we just loved it! As children, we were living the life for now and enjoying our lives. I think we still have to do it now. We need to laugh and @ CAPS1 in our lives, we need to focus on the positive and not dwell on the negative. The laughter from your @ CAPS2 should continue throughout your life. @ CAPS4 has blessed us so much, @ CAPS9 has given us more than we give @ CAPS10. Laugh for now, take @ CAPS1 into the little things in life, embrace the amazing creation that awaits you, and love others like @ CAPS4 loves you because you never know @ CAPS3 that your time on this earth is over.

  In life, every individual has their good days or their bad days. The last thing a person wants to do is be happy or laugh when that day has arrived. Sometimes a person has to think outside the box to look at the whole picture to feel happy about people This person is around, laughter also helps the time you spend more fun on yourself. Sometimes you may need to determine if he / she will be a person full of laughter or excitement. The more insight you can get into a person's feelings, the more laughter you can find deep within an individual's well-being.

 Growing up with both my parents and having my dad's parents (my grandparents) was the best thing for me. I spent a lot of time with my grandparents when I was @ CAPS3. Every @ DATE1 we were leaving @ CAPS1 an hour earlier. And every @ DATE1 of elementary school, my grandpa would wait for me to leave school. He would pick me up and then we would go to @ ORGANIZATION1 or @ CAPS2 for lunch. I always wanted to go to @ ORGANIZATION1 because they had a play structure. But growing up I got really close to my grandmother and grandfather. My parents didn't have to worry about babysitters because we always had my grandparents looking after me. Thus, the bond with them became stronger and stronger. I always did my homework with my grandma, and then when I was done I would go out with my grandpa and do some gardening or tinker with something in the garage. Much of what I know now was taught to me by my grandparents. I was very lucky @ CAPS3 @ CAPS5 to grow up having them in my life. Gardening with my @ CAPS6 (that's what I called my grandpa when I was @ CAPS3) was really fun. I loved the gardening. He taught me how to use the lawn mower at a very young age. So by the time I was @ NUM1 I could start it up, mow the lawn, dump the grass from the grass catcher, and put the mower back in the garage when I was done without any help. Well one sunny day @ DATE2 when I finished mowing the lawn my grandpa was sitting on the patio drinking @ NUM2 as always. So I grabbed one and went over to him because that's where he always sat and watched me mow the lawn and that's where we always hung out together. We're sitting there talking, and he asks me if I hung up the pipe at the fireplace. Of course I didn't because I wanted to go and sit on the patio with my @ CAPS6. So he and I walked over to the fireplace to reconnect it. But for some reason he told me to remove the nozzle tip from some flowers. Now here is a @ NUM1 year old kid standing behind his @ CAPS6 with the end of a hose with @ CAPS6 leaning in front of me. So I did what any other @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 would do. I lifted the nozzle, aimed at his fat ass, and pulled the trigger. After about a good @ NUM4 second of soaking her butt, I let the nozzle drop and ran as fast as I could towards my grandma. And when I got to her she was wondering why I was so scared. Well, all I would say is, "@ CAPS6 is going to kill me !". Here is @ CAPS6 walking to the front door which was right where Grandma and I were standing. He just had the straightest angry look on that face. I literally thought my butt was going to hurt forever after he spanked me. And so there the @ NUM5s of us were standing there. Me thinking I'm going to die. And all of a sudden my grandpa has the biggest smile on his face and he and my grandma start to crack. He wasn't crazy, he found it hilarious! So of course I laugh too! @ CAPS6 came in and changed his now water soaked pants and underwear, then we all walked out @ NUM5 onto the patio and just chilled out, talked and had some good @ NUM2. After a few hours of relaxing with the best grandparents in the world, my grandmother came inside to cook dinner. So @ CAPS6 and I stood on the patio and shot pine cones from the tree with a pistol @ CAPS7, to see who could shoot the most before dinner was ready. Grandma called us for dinner. And that night was one of the best dinners I ever had with my grandparents because all we did was eat, laugh, eat, laugh, eat a @ CAPS3 more, and to laugh one more @ CAPS3 ! Well @ CAPS6 and I had a tradition that started when I was old enough to talk, drink root beer floats, and watch @ CAPS8 together. And from that night until the day he died, my best friend was my @ CAPS6. He passed away about a year ago. Life hasn't been the same since. But when he passed, he left his truck with me. Every morning when I go up and start, the sound of the engine brings back memories of him and me. The sound of the blinker even brings back some memories. But I know every day he despises me and thinks about all the good times we had. Ah, how I miss the good times.

 When people think of football, they think of the quarterback. When people think of basketball, they think of the point guard. When people think of football, they think of the goalkeeper. Now, when people think of softball, they think of the pitcher. All of these sports have a position where they are automatically placed in a leadership position. In softball, play always begins with the pitcher and usually ends with the pitcher. The pitcher is in every room. Sometimes the pitcher throws it and the big @ NUM1 inch softball comes back to you before you even blink, then the ball you just threw under, now you have to throw it over onto the one of four bases in seconds. To play a major role in a team and be an effective leader, you need to be encouraging, helpful, and most importantly, when the game isn't going the way you want, be able to keep calm, laugh and joke about. the situation. I 've been pitching softball for the past ten years, and the compliment I get most often is " you have the best pitching mentality I've ever seen ". It's so stressful to be in a really competitive game and to have the whole game on your shoulders. Three people on the base, a bad pitch in the middle and it's over the fence. A single pitch can completely change the game! In times like these, when the pitch didn't turn out the way it was supposed to and all your time stared at you with that grim expression on your face. As the leader of the team, you can't just act the way you feel. I have observed many pitchers who give up completely and seem defeated. By being a leader, other athletes look to you for your reaction. If you seem like you have no hope, then players assume that the game is over and in the next game they are going to mess everything up and so on and it will only get worse. By smiling and encouraging your teammates, they see that the leader has not given up and they either, it's always better in the long run. Players tend to consider who has the most authority on the pitch and react exactly the same as they do. I play for a team where most of the players are in their second or third year. We're not a very good team but we train hard and we never give up no matter what the score. In our league, of the other seven teams, four are in the top ten statewide. One team in particular is @ LOCATION1, they were the first in the state last year and were the very first games last year. In the third round, we lost @ NUM2. Even though I knew there was no way to catch up, my goal was not to let them score again. Between innings I talked to every player on my team, tried cheesy jokes, inside jokes, anything to get rid of the tension. It worked and we played a lot better having fun and being relaxed. Being in stressful situations, people just have to find a way to laugh and see the bright side of any difficult situation and be able to get out of it.

We all need to laugh once in our life! But why do we need it? or why is it important to us ?. We need to laugh to have a good time with our friends and family because without laughing our life would be black and white, we would be empty inside with no spark of happiness and we would be cranky all the time. Laughter is also important for us because it also allows us as people to have a relationship with someone we really love, maybe a woman or a man, it is also important that in the relationship , you also have a great time when you are with that special someone and don't get bored and talk about things that don't really matter when you are with that person. It's fun when you make someone laugh because it shows that @ CAPS6 is having a good time with you and might want to go out on another day and that's why we need to laugh in a relationship or in friendships. Once I lived at @ LOCATION3 until my parents decided to move to @ PERSON2. @ CAPS5 my parents told me I was going to @ LOCATION1 I knew a few people from this @ LOCATION1. that I knew were @ NUM1, and @ PERSON1 but I didn't really speak with @ LOCATION2 or @ CAPS1 until I only spoke with @ PERSON1. On the first day of @ LOCATION1 he introduced me to friends from @ CAPS2 because I didn't know anyone other than the three of them, he was making all kinds of jokes and getting me involved so I could better meet these friends and maybe be friends with them but laugh always makes friends and boyfriends because i started dating when i was in the middle @ LOCATION1 I dated three guys my third boyfriend was the best he was nice and kind he would @ CAPS3 never just to make me laugh we only dated for @ NUM2 years but @ CAPS5 there was too much drama that i broke up with him it was really hard because i was it 'really loved but we were still talking and making fun of each other he would still be nice to me even if we weren't together like he wanted and me but just because of the drama we had, we broke up.always laughing don't get discouraged just because of a relationship smile and laugh.After a year without dating he decided to ask me if I wanted to be @ CAPS2's girlfriend again and I thought about it a lot because I didn't want to go through the same drama as before . While we weren't dating, he always found a way to make me laugh or smile. when he sees me @ CAPS2 always there to support me and make me laugh it's @ CAPS3 I like about him that @ CAPS2 sweet and kind but if he didn't believe @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2 the friends tell him that we would always be together and we would laugh about everything together. We laughed at each other we never stopped laughing it was good times when I was with him but he always tries to keep a smile on my face even if I'm mad with sadness or not in the mood to do something that's why we need to laugh in our lives because it brings joy to the people who love us and take care of us and with a smile on their face @ CAPS6 are happy. Always make a great relationship by having a good time and making each other laugh somehow, it doesn't matter @ CAPS3 you are laughing, the thing is you are having fun. Another way to have fun and enjoy your relationship and your friends at the same time is to hang out and maybe go to the movies with all your friends and boyfriend and go and watch a movie or something. 'go to the fair where you think you want to go. but also think about your friends and your boyfriend if @ CAPS6 is going to have fun or if @ CAPS6 is going to be bored. When you go with them make sure to make them laugh at least so @ CAPS6 knows you are having fun, make a joke but don't say a joke that will make them fall asleep like my little sister @ CAPS4 us says a joke goes like this (dude on @ NUM3 am I talking to your dad ? "the little boy whispers and says" @ CAPS2 busy ! "," @ CAPS3 about your mom ? "the man said on the phone, @ CAPS5 the kid said “@ CAPS4 is busy too!” @ CAPS5 the man asked him “@ CAPS5 @ CAPS3 does @ CAPS6 do?” And the boy said “@ CAPS6 is looking for me!” We don’t didn't understand at first @ CAPS5 my sister told us that the boy was hiding from the parents of @ CAPS2 because he took the phone with him because in the boy does not tell jokes like that makes him more fun. and that's why we need to laugh in our life.

 embarrassing laughter Have you ever thought that something was really funny where you felt like you were going to pee your pants ? Or did you feel like the side of your stomach was going to explode because you were laughing out loud @ CAPS1 ? well it happened to me, it was all @ CAPS1 crazy as a dream it was during my graduation @ NUM1 @ DATE1 to be exact. My brother @ PERSON3 and my friend @ PERSON1 and I walking in the park keeping in mind we are just trying to have a good time. My brother was telling @ LOCATION1 about this really funny joke he told at school. I don't remember the joke but I remember how funny it was because I almost peed in my pants it was @ CAPS1 embarrassing but at the same time funny I don't know why though. @ CAPS1 I told them if they kept telling each other jokes I might pee in my pants. But among hearts what any brother would do is keep going they thought it was just @ CAPS1 funny well not me I thought it was mean and painful if you dont get what i want say because I had complete baldness. My friend @ PERSON1 the sweet and loving person suggested to her to go find a bathroom, @ CAPS1 we went on a mission to find a bathroom @ PERSON3 my brother said "Well I think there is a bathroom at the top of that hill, let's check it outside and see if it's open @ CAPS1 @ PERSON2 can go to the toilet ". Little did we say it was @ DATE2 and the bathrooms were closed for workers to come in and clean. painful, I couldn't put it into words. soon enough I discovered the doors where locked I was @ CAPS1 insane and devastated. @ PERSON3 and @ ORGANIZATION1 thought it was funny because I really had to pee and the bathroom was close, they were laughing loudly @ CAPS1, but I was sick of hearing them @ CAPS1 I gave them up to go finding the bathroom closing unfortunately it was a mile and a half that drove me crazy @ CAPS1 crazy I wanted to cry. But of course that wouldn't get me anywhere! this is what I have sad in my head "that means that I need to run". I ran up the hill, crossed the bridge, and picked the closest store as possible. ULTIMATELY!!! I found a store, it was a sigh of eff. I was @ CAPS1 happy, could barely breathe at this point. I walk into the store to the store clerk and I ask them @ MONTH1 I use your toilet they show me the detraction I walk in it with my head held high and I feel like I have accomplished something even if I didn't except the fact that I didn't pee my self thank God !! @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON3 end up coughing with me they enter the wound looking for me I leave the bathroom to find them standing near the door waiting for me then all the sound I see a change in their face they laugh I ask them what's funny @ CAPS1 and they point their finger at my paints i looked down and i see water all over my pants i must have water on me when i was washing my hands well , it's embarassing. but to this day, when I look back on that moment, I laugh every time I hear it because it was embarrassing but at the same time it was as funny as it could be.

 Laughter is the only characteristic that a person can perfect. Laughter is the element that could bring a group of people closer to a close bond of friends. Laughter is the ultimate answer to success and happiness in life, and that's what my story asked me to say about laughter. Several times my family of four leaves for camping during @ DATE1. Family friends love to come with us on this vacation. A few summers ago, on a camping trip with my family and many friends, I experienced and learned what a real rich laugh could do that changed my life. Whether I learn by telling funny stories around a campfire, playing little jokes on each other, or just playing some old friendly card games, I really started to realize what these time had meant to me. My best friend and I were expecting these three boys to join us all week. When the time came for them to arrive, my friend and I began to work out our secret plan. It was the boys' duty before they could go to the lake and start boating, pitch their tent. They managed to get a @ NUM1 minute task to take two hours, well done to them. The three lost boys were now at the water's edge as they were finally done and couldn't bear to be anywhere other than the lake. While they were swimming, my friend and I took their fierce tent and tore off the stakes to collapse it first, then flip it over afterwards. What better way to welcome newcomers than to start things off with a good sense of humor. However, the boys didn't think it was that funny, but in the fall @ TIME1 they had a plan in them that my friend and I knew was coming for us. The alarm went off around four in the @ TIME2 for the two of us girls in a non-soundproof tent. We had a really loud alarm clock that sounded like the ducks were in a war zone against each other. We later found out that the ducks found sandwiches mysteriously placed in a direct circle all around our tent. It was gone after the boys did this prank. It's hard for guys to get you back, if they're stuck in a tent. A zip tie would do the trick. In the middle of @ TIME1, crawl sneakily and tie their zippers together. Just as my friend and I thought this was the perfect way to get the boys back, one of our co-partners went over to explain our plan to them. The three Amigos then wanted to turn around and do it to us first. The next @ TIME2 my friend and I woke up, we tried to get out of the tent and it was a little hard to do. Our zippers were tied together and it's not that great to mix up when you have girls who really need to use the toilet. One of the boys had a pocket knife with him and he was playing cat and mouse with us, barely leaving the knife out of our reach. When I finally grabbed the small blade, tore the zippers, gently threw the knife to the floor, and ran to the ladies' toilet. When I came back to the blood on the floor, I found it wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be. The same guy who gave us the knife to use put his foot on the thrown knife very lightly. When he got home, his mother took him to the hospital for stitches. Campfire @ TIME1 was a hoot. The cards together were also hilarious because in the end we knew how each person was going to play, pretty much we knew who would win and who would come dead @ TIME1. Even with someone with an open foot, we were on the ground rolling around because we were laughing so hard. My friend and I took off the makeup and jeans, put on a loose sweatshirt and put our hair up in our hair and we had a really great time at @ TIME1. It was the @ TIME1 together there during the camping trip and it was nice knowing we were having a great time laughing, just being ourselves and expressing ourselves without trying to impress. Later, as we all talked about these stories and jokes, we came to recognize that these are the kinds of times people live for. Laughing brought us closer together, we weren't friends before and now, after our shared moments, we're exceptionally close best friends. Our friendship was brought into contact by laughing in harmony together, by the @ TIME1 spent together, by harmless little jokes played on each other, turning a camping trip into something much more meaningful.

 Can you imagine life without laughing? Life would be so serious and relationships would be so boring. That favorite comedy? Not funny. America's @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3, how not to laugh ! Laughter is a way to express emotions in a positive way. What are relationships built on? Honesty, trust, understanding and humor. Are you sure you want to be with someone @ CAPS4 is boring ? Because I don't. I believe that friendships and strong relationships need a laugh to keep them interesting. A lot of my relationships started with a joke, a laugh, or my awkwardness. I remember being in a class where I didn't know anyone, and it's a very difficult situation. I sat at the back of the class, with another person, her name was @ PERSON1. It started off pretty and silently, so I decided to tell an extremely cheesy joke. As soon as I said it, there was a silence afterwards, where we just looked at each other. Seconds later we burst out laughing, you know the kind of uncontrollable laughter, where you can't breathe, and your tear ducts are submerged to the point that tears run down your cheeks? When that happened, there was a sudden bond, a spark of friendship between the two of us. From then on we were inseparable. For the rest of the school year, we were partners on each project, multitasking. Half the time, we make up funny scenarios and laugh until we cry. The other half, we would have done a fantastic project inspiring each other to get the job done. I am a " lover of laughter !" " I can make them more fun little things is a quality I appreciate @ CAPS4 knew that stupid joke could go so far ? Laughter cannot be the only part of a developed relationship, it takes trust, honesty, and various qualities to keep a relationship healthy. My point is, how can you maintain a friendship with someone @ CAPS4 who you can laugh with or be yourself with? It's human nature to laugh, you can't always be serious. I don't think I could go a day without laughing. Laughter can be the antidote to a frown. Moral of the story, laugh!

 For my family, laughter is important to us because it just means that my parents are not fighting that day. I was about nine years old and it was the week of @ DATE1. My parents had been fighting all day, it seemed like it would never end. Usually @ DATE1 was what I had been looking forward to all year, but now I just wanted it to be over. I hated seeing my parents arguing, because it always scared my little brother. My little sister was too young to know what was going on, but every time they started fighting around her she would start screaming and screaming. When my parents fought, I tried to occupy my brother and sister, but it never occupied me. I still heard everything they said and it never seemed to stop. My sister was about a year old and when my parents were arguing she would often come to my room because it was the room furthest from where the screaming took place. We were watching @ CAPS1 and playing games until it stopped. Once it lasted so long that she fell asleep in my room and I ended up taking her to her bed that night. There have been so many times that I have wished my parents would stop fighting and realize that it not only upsets them, but upsets us all. Well the day before the @ DATE1 day before my mom was at work and my dad had to go to work too. As my mother's job does not allow the children to be there, my father took us. I could tell he got up late because he had dark circles under his eyes and forgot to shave at @ TIME1. Since we were all on school break, I spent the whole day making sure my little sister didn't mess around or hurt herself. I used to have fun at my dad's job because I loved playing with my little sister. My sister still wobbles when she walked, so it made me laugh when we were playing cat because she could never run fast enough and it made me laugh just to see her try. She loved it too because walking now gave her so much more freedom, but now she got into a lot more silliness. On the days when my father didn't have much to do, he would ask me to help him try to teach my brother to ride a two-wheeler. It was great fun seeing my brother trying new things and having fun with it. It made us all laugh that day because he was so excited and happy that he could do something he couldn't do before. When the day before @ DATE1 arrived, my parents agreed to stop fighting for the next few days because they wanted us to be happy on @ DATE1 @ TIME1. Except that night they had a really big argument after they thought we had all gone to bed. I had stayed awake very late that night because I was watching a bunch of my favorite @ CAPS2 movies. I had just turned off the @ CAPS1 when I heard them scream. I didn't get much sleep that night because of all the screaming and screaming. Luckily my brother and sister were already asleep and I didn't have to worry about them. The next @ TIME1, I didn't know what to expect from my parents. Everything was as usual on @ DATE1 @ TIME1. There were gifts under the tree and stuff in our stockings. My brother came in and woke me up and told me everyone was in the living room waiting for me to get my butt out of bed. I got out of bed, put on my robe and slippers, and walked out into the living room. What I saw on the way out was not what I expected at all. My brother sorted the presents so that everyone had their stack. My dad laughed at my sister, who was trying to pick up a present as big as her. And my mom was in the kitchen making everyone's favorite breakfast, chocolate chip pancakes, bacon, and sausage. Everyone seemed so much happier than they had been the past few days. As we all ate our breakfasts and opened presents, I realized this was the first @ TIME1 in a while that my parents hadn't been in a fight. It made me really happy to see them get along. We all laughed and had a great time this @ DATE1 @ TIME1. The rest of the day was great too. Laughter is still a big part of my family, even though my parents are separated now. It's a lot better now because we have a lot more times of laughing and being happy than being upset and having to listen to them fight all the time. Now that we're happy and laughing a lot more, being at home is a lot better. I truly believe that laughter plays a big role in any family.

Many people believe that laughter is a key part of any relationship. There are many times when even the slightest laugh is needed to break the tension, or even just to relieve the stress every now and then. It is often said that laughter is the best medicine, and also the cheapest. Laughter is easy to find and common. In my case, laughter comes naturally to my sister and I and for no particular reason; he not only saved, but he built our relationship to who he is today. When we were younger my older sister and I didn't get along very well at all. She always teased me, then laughed; and I too laughed at things that she didn't find humorous in any way. This constantly caused conflicts and many arguments between the two of us ; so we hated each other and in a way didn't want anything to do with each other. As I got older and wiser, my sister and I started to look a lot more alike. We have always laughed, teased, annoyed and played childish pranks; but instead of getting angry, we just laugh about it instead. As we continued to make each other laugh, we got along much better. Soon after, we started dating more and more and just for fun, not because our parents told us too. Before we knew it, my sister and I were best friends. It's rare to hear that siblings are best friends. I am lucky to be able to say that my older sister is my best friend. Personally, I think laughter played a huge role in my older sister's relationship with me. Now we depend on each other because we both know that no matter what, we can always make each other laugh and cheer each other up practically. We go out when we need to get away from it all or when we have something we need to get rid of our chest. We know we're together for this because we know we can always laugh about it at the end.

 Laughter is an interesting emotion. It's the one you expect to feel when you're happy or full of humor. However, this is not always the case. Some people laugh when they are embarrassed or uncomfortable. Others, when they are enraged and upset. And then there are people who laugh when they are in mourning or sad. People don't expect this to happen. Laugh when you're depressed. It's strange but true. I know this from personal experience, which led to one of the most tragic events of my short life. I was about nine years old. At age @ CAPS4 you are hyper and energetic almost non-stop. I had just come home from school and walked through the front door. My mom was waiting @ CAPS3 inside. “@ CAPS1 on @ CAPS2,” she said. “We're going to see your grandparents for a few hours. I was angry. I was not only tired and hungry, but had to drive almost an hour to see my grandparents. So I did what any nine year old would do. I cried and cried and begged her not to go. She didn't listen of course. She toned up @ CAPS3, waited until I ran out of air, then picked up @ CAPS3 and tossed @ CAPS3 in the car. Isn't the nap great? This is exactly what I did on the ride. I was applauded, so I thought it was good to have some "@ CAPS3" time. When we got to their house, I had just woken up and didn't want to move. I had to force myself to stand up and say hello. It was depressing, but truly fascinating. Seeing your grandparents is like having a glimpse into the future. In the sense that you know what you're gonna look like when you're old. They had sweets though, which were tasty and appetizing. We actually stayed for a few hours. My mom called my dad several times to ask if we could go home, but we never did. She just had a conversation with my grandparents while I was watching TV. Finally my dad finally called to say we could @ CAPS1 at home. We said goodbye and booked before it got too dark. By the time we got home it was pitch dark outside. We still hadn't eaten and I was hungry. I jumped out of the car and headed for the gate that separated the front yard from the back. I shook the door, expecting three delighted dogs to run up and start to jump out the door wanting to play. Instead, only two showed. "@ CAPS4 from @ CAPS5 ?" I was wondering. I thought he was most likely eating or sleeping, so I decided to go inside and eat. When I opened the door to the house, both of my parents were standing in the hallway. I could tell they were trying to hold back their tears. Then it hit @ CAPS3 like a ton of bricks. “@ CAPS5 has passed away,” my mother said. I froze. I didn't believe them. I could not. My best friend in the world was gone. I cried for hours, maybe more. I did not know what to do. Then something weird happened. I started to laugh. I don't know why I did it. Maybe it's because I wanted to try to cheer myself up. Or maybe I realized he was in a better place. To this day I still feel an empty space in my heart @ CAPS4 my best friend once was. I still think about why I laughed that day. I think about why we usually laugh. Whether it's when you're happy, angry, or even sad, we laugh to try to cope and make the most of good and bad situations. As tragic as the situation is, I can't help but feel happy. My best friend was in pain and could barely walk so we had to euthanize him. I knew it was the right thing to do, and frankly, I don't think I would have felt better if I hadn't laughed that night. It was awkward at first. It was bad and terrible, but it helped @ CAPS3 more than I could have predicted.

The @ CAPS1 of laughter The @ CAPS1 of a single laugh is a pretty amazing thing. Laughter has a strange way of bringing two people together or, when used wrongly, separating them. In all of my relationships, I have realized that being able to joke and laugh with each other is a big deal. I noticed lately that I have an amazing best friend. @ PERSON1 is still there for me even after the mistake I made which ended up tearing us apart. Now that we've gotten over the @ CAPS2 and can laugh about it, I've found that it makes the awkwardness a lot easier and brings me and my friends together. Even when a best friend does something that wasn't right and neither of them wants to fix it. The @ CAPS2 started the last @ DATE1 during my @ CAPS4 football season and never should have gone this far or involved a friend of mine. It was the hardest thing to admit I had done wrong; both for her and for him. The day we got caught is now what I consider the scariest and worst day of my life. The @ CAPS2 has also become a big learning point in my life, I have learned that all my actions have consequences and how to balance what I want with what I really should be doing. When I started football for @ CAPS4 I had never played with anyone and realized that by being the youngest on a @ NUM1 team I should stand out and prove myself. This is exactly what I did ; but not to the whole team. After playing for about two weeks, I had started to notice one of the boys who was on my team. I hadn't really thought about it, but when he and I started to continue our relationship, it became a whole different thing. The boy and I had been dating for about a month and a half when it started to involve @ PERSON1. See, we weren't exactly allowed to date or even dated, but we knew we would take the risk of getting into trouble for each other. And as time went on and we started to get closer to each other, we also started to fall in love. This @ MONTH1 was the reason I chose what I had, but at the time it all seemed perfectly logical. Then the @ ORGANIZATION1 came along and we thought it would be a great time to see each other, we didn't know this choice would make us lose us, me lose my freedom, we both ruin my parents' trust and worst of all of all of me throwing a great friend. We didn't think about these consequences so we went all the way. He would meet me at @ ORGANIZATION1 and tell my parents that I was just going to be with @ PERSON1. At first and for the most part, everything was fine, he and me were having a great time because we could finally hang out together and no one knew what was really going on. I had no idea my mom called @ PERSON1's mom to make sure I was going to be where I said it was and who I said it with, and as soon as she found out I was not everything happened from there. It had been a few hours already and we were starting to get hungry but neither of us wanted to eat the fatty food at @ ORGANIZATION1 so we decided to take another chance and go, with me leaving @ PERSON1 at @ ORGANIZATION1 and she not knowing where I was going. As my mom got more and more worried she started calling @ PERSON1 to see where I was and of course @ PERSON1 had no idea. On his call list, there was me. When my mom first tried calling me I decided not to answer and make her think I was just doing a trick or something, but when she kept on Calling me, I knew something was wrong. As I answered the phone, I knew she knew what I had done, but I still didn't want to believe what was going on. I thought the only way my mom would find out was because @ PERSON1 called and told her she couldn't find me and who I was with. So that's what I ended up accusing @ PERSON1 of for at least a month after this happened. I couldn't look at her or even speak to her without feeling resentment and embarrassment. When everything finally calmed down, from arrest to grounding throughout @ DATE2, I knew I had to apologize for the position I had placed @ PERSON1 in. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. But now, knowing that @ PERSON1 and I can laugh about it, it is much easier and better to remember that time.

 Green is not my favorite color. Humor is contagious. The sound of a roaring laugh is far more contagious than any cough, sniffle, or sneeze. When laughter is shared with each other, it binds people together and increases happiness and intimacy. Having to choose one of the millions of laughing memories I had was nearly impossible for me to decide, as every moment I spend opening my mouth and exploding my "ha-ha-ha" of joy and joy. excitation. I try to please the person I spent it with and the exact memory that happened. It was @ DATE1, @ CAPS1 for many of us @ DATE1 is one of the most excited times of our twelve months of the year. I was going to have a pool party with all my friends, @ CAPS12 I needed to clean it up because it was terribly disgusting all seasons of the year that the weather decided to bring down. I didn't think it would be such a big deal because it was the only way for me to organize my party with permission from my parents. @ CAPS1 if you know me well enough I'm the typical average teenager who probably texts more than @ NUM1 SMS per day. So since I can't keep my hands white and a little sweaty from my phone, you @ MOIS1 already have an idea of what happens next. If you taught, I let it go. You are absolutely wrong. Unsurprisingly, after cleaning my pool for about an hour, I was finally done, @ CAPS2 I texted my boyfriend to tell him my pool was no longer green. He replied with ".......?" I wondered if I had sent the wrong message to the wrong person so I checked my history and it turned out that I wrote to him: "@ CAPS3 my poo is no longer green. I was literally mortified. I didn't know what emotion to feel or what to expect from him later in the day. I decided to pretend that this doesn't happen anymore. Later that day my pool party started. Everyone introduced themselves and looked at me in a weird way so usually @ CAPS12 I was ecstatic and pumped by my favorite song by my favorite singer @ NUM2. As everyone introduced themselves they all had gift bags in their hands I wondered why they brought presents if it wasn't nobody's birthday it was just a party by the sea by the pool to accommodate everyone's favorite season, @ DATE1. So I asked my best friend and she said, "@ CAPS4 we know it's nobody's birthday @ CAPS12 @ CAPS5 texted us all to let us know you had to green poo and you weren't feeling good then we went to @ CAPS6 to buy you @ CAPS7- @ CAPS8, and @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10. " I was petrified and to be honest I was laughing incredibly loudly. So I stood up in front of all my guests and told them what really happened and we all laughed historically. Without exception, we kept the party going and I finally saw my boyfriend arrive. I walked over to him and all we did was laugh compassionately without saying a word about what had happened. After the party was over and dawn had fallen, we decided to have a bonfire and get comfortable with our loved one, and all of our friends bond with each other. You can guess what happened next, we started talking about what happened earlier and I can honestly say I don't think I've laughed so much in my fifteen years of life. Quickly our curfew had almost expired for the day, so all of my friends left and gave me a nickname, "@ CAPS11". @ CAPS12 the funniest part of this story that I will never forget is that when all my friends are gone my boyfriend decided to take me out and buy a burger from our local, also known as the best burger of our city. As we were finishing our meal, a mother came with her little boy. I must have taken a few seconds of my life to wear it, and make my face fake to make it shake a bit. @ CAPS12 I didn't know the baby had just eaten. So you can imagine what happens next, green vomit comes over me. Honestly, I wasn't angry or embarrassed. I just laughed so hard I could feel my abs working and the tears in my eyes coming out. I believe in each of our lives, we all have a special time that we desire to worship forever. Whether @ MONTH1 is sad, embarrassing, or even a comedic quality moment that we indulge in our memory. So, to this day, I am still known as “@ CAPS11” by my friends, and there is no doubt that I will never forget that memory.

 Laughter in someone's life is very important for many different reasons. You can get to know someone by what they think is funny, show emotion, and connect with others just by laughing together. The clearest memories for anyone or the most personal can be a laughing matter. These are also the memories that people would like to remember vividly. I think the quote "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." is extremely accurate for the most part. I have lots of memories of laughing with my friends, family and loved ones around me. I will never forget some stories I had in life because of all the laughs they contain. When I was about six and my brother about nine, we didn't always get along, being the typical brother and sister that we were. We both had very outgoing personalities and had to do something about it all the time. When we got along, we usually had so much fun, that we ended up laughing together and forgetting that we were mad at each other. Some of the things we would do would be play hide and seek inside and outside our house, tag, play boring games, and our favorite thing was to tickle the monster. Sometimes our closest friends would play with us, but it was usually something my family did. Most of the time my brother and I would ask my dad to play with us because playing two-player games was not that much fun back then. He generally agreed because he enjoyed watching us laugh together and create new memories and new stories. When the three of us got together and played games, I felt like I was on top of the world and I was really happy at this point in my life. My favorite time that I can think of playing games with them was when we first started playing hide and seek in our house. My brother and I were usually crammed into small spaces like under the sink, under the beds and in closets. We couldn't wear them for very long as they were very difficult to fit even for a small child. My father being much taller than us children, he always hid in the shower or behind the doors. It was really easy to find but we always found it to be a lot of fun and we laughed every time we found it. One of the times it was his turn to hide and my brother went to my room to count to the number we wanted. We were small children in the hospital, so we usually didn't count up to the number my dad told us. Then we ran down our stairs, turned the corner, ran down the hall and found him hidden behind the bathroom door. You could always tell if he was there or not, because if he was, the door wouldn't open fully. Instead of coming out of his hiding place when we found him and counting for us while we were hiding, he started chasing us around the house. We didn't expect it at all so we were laughing and running and struggling to breathe. Eventually it caught up with us and our hide and seek game turned into the best monster tickle game ever ! My brother thought we should hide under my parents' blanket on their bed, but that made us an easier target for my tickle monster dad. By the time he finished tickling us, our faces were red, we were breathless, tired and had the biggest smiles on our laughing faces. Trying to breathe, trying to escape and laughing at the same time was really tiring us. My dad finally took us to the table where we had lunch and then we all fell asleep with our bellies full and as happy as possible. It was a really fun memory that I have with lots of laughs and good times. For me, laughing is a big part of knowing someone and building relationships that already exist. It puts everyone in a good mood and makes people happy.

 Laughter is the expression of being happy, of being able to be yourself with those you care about, and to express your feelings. Anyone can share the laughter with anyone, even if someone you don't know very well or someone you have known for a long time and you don't speak anymore, get someone to other feels good sharing a laugh with him. Last year my close friend, @ LOCATION1 and I were together almost every day. We always make others laugh at the silliest little things, even if no one else understands what we're talking about. We can make any little thing laugh. We go out a lot, which makes it easy to share our laughs with each other. One day in class, we were just sitting in class reading a book and I turn around, there she is asleep, with drool coming out of her mouth. The room was quiet, I tried not to laugh really hard, I started to laugh. I pushed her and she woke up with her hair stuck to the side of her face. It was so funny, I couldn't hold it back anymore. She had a confused look on her face then I pulled out my mirror and showed her what I was laughing at, then she started to laugh too. She stared at her hair and wiped off the slime. Then the teacher approached us and asked if we had a problem. We looked at each other and laughed and then answered no, we have no problem here. The next day we were on our way to the common room after we got back from @ ORGANIZATION1 and we overheard a girl say to another girl, " Do all you do is say bullshit about your sister? ? " The girl @ CAPS1 was not an ordinary girl, she had dyed purple hair and teeth sticking out his lower lip, which made it even more hilarious. @ LOCATION1 and I looked at each other and we were like shit, did it really happen right there? We started laughing after we got out of earshot so she couldn't hear us laughing at her. We laughed about it the rest of the year. Every time we saw her after that we called her "girl with purple hair" because no other girl in our school at the time had purple hair so it was very easy to spot her in the crowd. Still up to date @ CAPS1 laugh every now and then about this situation. Weeks later after @ CAPS1 happened we saw her ex boyfriend dating a bunch of girls so we got closer to see who they were, I didn't know any of them but I saw a few and knew they were in first grade. @ LOCATION1 gives them a dirty look and says he's definitely been downgraded since I dated him. There was a certain girl literally hanging over him. She wasn't even pretty at all. Her hair was short, but her hair was all greasy, it was as if she had put on a lot of gel or hadn't taken a shower for two days. The girl was wearing clothes that were obviously too small for her, you could see half of her upper body just exposed there. It was really bad. We started laughing really hard because it was so obvious that she was trying to get his attention and he was ignoring her totally. @ LOCATION1 looked at me and we both started to laugh. I don't really know what she was laughing at, because I was laughing at the girl hanging out all over the old boyfriend from @ LOCATION1. The next day we were in class @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 and I made a comment about someone being stupid and a student in the class tried to get me into trouble, but luckily my teacher m liked it a lot better than the other student, because that person got into trouble a lot more than I did. Later that day I was called to the office because the assistant manager needed to talk to me. He said the @ CAPS1 student had a problem with me calling him stupid. I had a lot of issues with the person @ CAPS1 and told the assistant manager he was very rude, and also explained everything that had happened earlier. The assistant manager told me that I had no problem because he was trying to start a problem. We laughed because he tried to get me into trouble and it didn't work, and then we both laughed because this student is a troublemaker. I've learned that throughout life you have to have a good laugh every now and then because laughter expresses your feelings and sometimes you feel really good. I know that with my experience, I need to have these loved ones to make me laugh, also to make me go through everything that I go through.

 Many people say that the people who laugh the most live longer. I remember when I was ten years old I was going to learn to ride a bike. I had no idea it would be a difficult task. My brother said I don't need training wheels. Even though I was scared, watching other children ride their bikes gave me the courage to learn to ride a bike. It was the big day, it was a perfect day to learn to ride a bike. As I walked down the stairs, fully equipped and ready, I started to feel @ LOCATION1. I went out, my big brother was waiting for me. He had a helmet and the bike, he started to review the ground rules. Slowly I started to get on the bike, I was confident that I could do it. Then it was time to gear up and put on my helmet. My heart was pounding, I could feel my blood running through my veins. While giving the first pedal, I fell and hit the ground extremely hard. All I wanted was to run home and cry in my mom's lap. I looked up at my brother, he asked me if I was okay. Until this day, I remember laughing instead of crying, after all, crying wasn't going to make the pain go away or teach me to ride a bike. Finally, I got back on this bike and peddled and peddled. I remember my brother telling me that laughter is the best medicine there is. I was laughing like a peddler, sometimes I think maybe it was the laughter that made me reach my goal of learning to ride a bike. in my life laughing, smiling and having fun is big business. You can't always take laughter too seriously.

 When I was adopted, I didn't know what to expect. I thought about what @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2 looked like, what the house looked like and whether they would have liked me or not. I was told that I was going to have two new sisters named @ PERSON2 and @ CAPS3. Sitting in the passenger seat of the black @ ORGANIZATION3 @ CAPS4, my heart started pounding harder and harder as it passed each street, getting closer every second to the house I might soon call mine. As I approached the driveway, I saw a well-appointed one-story blue house. The door was opened by a very tall, well-built man, who seemed to come out of his job. He was very welcoming and said his name was @ CAPS5, as he invited me in I was greeted by a white pit bull named @ CAPS6. On the right there was a short haired girl who was a little taller than me named @ CAPS3. I was a year older than her, so I saw it as a fun thing to have a little sister. At first I didn't notice she was watching me and finally when I noticed she gave me a really big smile exposing her beautiful straight teeth. When I met @ CAPS1 who told me her name was @ PERSON1, I immediately felt this warm feeling of acceptance. She was also a little taller than me and was very pretty. They told me that I would meet @ PERSON2, my older sister on the following @ DATE1 because she was attending college at @ LOCATION1 at @ ORGANIZATION1. We stood in the kitchen and talked a bit, trying to get to know each other's basics. I became very talkative as small electric currents of anxiety ran through my body. We talked about our interests for a while, and then I finally asked them what the rules were. The answer I got was quite different from what I thought I was going to get. I learned that they never had to punish any of the girls, the only thing I should make sure to do is just respect everyone in the house. Finally, @ CAPS2 decided it was time for the grand tour of the house. My room was a room that was used as a storage room at the moment, so I had to stay with @ CAPS3 in his room for a few weeks until @ CAPS2 could get all the things out into a shed where he was going to build in there. 'outside in the back yard. The continued rain kept him from doing anything outside, so instead he built a desk for the computer that would fit in the picture window next to the kitchen. Since Plan A didn't work for my bedroom, @ CAPS1 ended up turning the office into my bedroom and the bay window was converted into office space for @ CAPS2 so I could run his business. With each passing week I started to feel more comfortable, my favorite part of the day was dinner because @ CAPS1 was a really good cook. @ CAPS1 would take me to counseling sessions to ease the transition into the family. I've never had someone put my needs first, and that made me feel loved for once in my life. It has always been very easy to talk to @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS2, but I always found it a little harder to talk to @ CAPS3. I was always afraid of saying too much or not saying enough, or even not being able to say the right thing at the right time. Trying to connect with my sister was a challenge for me. I wanted to know what her interests were, but she was constantly with her friends or doing her homework. It wasn't until my @ ORGANIZATION1 was hosting a @ CAPS18 @ CAPS19 fundraiser that we decided to go. She invited her friend @ PERSON3 and I went to buy their ice cream. When we arrived and got our ice cream we were all seated at a table when suddenly the friends from @ ORGANIZATION2 @ ORGANIZATION1 show up and decide to leave @ CAPS3. I immediately see the pain in @ CAPS3's gaze, so I started telling him a funny story about something that had happened to me. Once I was done we laughed and then she responded with a story of her own. We continued to exchange in a two-way conversation, and without realizing it, we really had fun. It wasn't until later that week, when I went to see the counselor, that I learned that laughter brings people together and connects them in ways you can't imagine. To this day @ CAPS3 and I are very close, and we have even made fun of each other now. I love my little sister @ CAPS3.

 Laughter helps in so many situations throughout life. When you are angry, sad, nervous, or even in mourning. Laughing at the good times @ CAPS1 had with an old friend, or realizing a situation isn't scary or sad, but it is really, really hilarious. Many times in my life when things have happened that somehow upset me, people close to me have always helped me by making me laugh. Realizing what was going on wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Which made me see the positive and light side of things. A specific situation arose when I was about nine years old. In school, most children at one point or another say something hurtful or without thinking. While parents should teach their children better, it seems to be in their nature to make rash observations, sometimes hurting others by calling attention to flaws. I was sitting in class working on an art project. There were three other kids in my party and we were talking about whatever, that was so many years ago. But then the boy starts talking about the weight and how he is so tough and muscular, and yes they were all eight or nine, but he thought he was cool. So he turns to me and says "@ CAPS1 is out of shape, your fat". It crushed me how was I supposed to respond to that. I tried to pretend I didn't mind. I ended up finishing my art project. I couldn't help but hear those nasty words that stung me repeat in my head. My eyes started to cry and soon a drop of water appeared on my paper, I couldn't hold back my tears. I was waiting for the bell to ring so I could get out of this terrible place and go home to people who were smarter than to say things like this boy did. As I got off the bus, I could already feel the emotions rising to the surface. Starting to scream as my mom opened the door. She exclaimed "@ CAPS2 what is it, what happened ?" @ CAPS3 tears I relayed the terrible scene. She felt bad for me and asked for the boys' names. I told him @ PERSON1. She laughed and said "That chubby kid with baby teeth? Oh honey don't let that bother @ CAPS1 he's out of shape at all." I started to laugh when I realized he had saw teeth. The tears stopped coming to my eyes and I really realized the whole situation. He was thoughtless and bragged about himself, which the statement wasn't even true and I wasn't fat. Laughing made me feel better and realize how silly this all was. Laughter really helped me realize it wasn't that bad. I was still a little embarrassed but I was done with it. Laughter also distracted me from what @ PERSON1 told me. Of course, even if he gave me a rash comment, I wouldn't have given a rash compliment on any of those flaws. But laughing at the way he had saw teeth made me feel better. Laughing also made me see how big a deal I was making out of a small situation, too.

     To laugh, you have to be happy. I used to be happy until I made mistakes. The mistakes I made disappointed me more than anything I could think of. I'm sitting in a room that I don't want because of my actions. My life was perfect before I had my brothers, my parents and my love of life. Now I think back to how nothing is worth walking away from them. The laughs that I miss right now are what hurt me the most, because I might be at home or even at school right now. Instead, I'm here without my laughs, my brothers, my parents, and my love. I try to make myself smile even though I know I'm happy. My life was one of the best lives you could have asked for, but because of my actions I ruined it. Every moment that I had with my beautiful baby girl, in other words my love. I cherished the time I spent with her and now I have to wait to laugh with her. I have about forty-five minutes and an hour and a half every day to talk to him and my family, and it certainly hurts more than you might imagine. having to talk on the phone you can barely hear throwing them it's just killing me. Knowing that everything I have done has affected me and my family. Lots of effects on my brothers and I know they don't understand, but I hope one day they will understand. hear my little brother @ CAPS1 on the phone cry because he can't see me. It hurts even inside to write about it right now makes me want to burst into tears. I almost fell like I could in front of these other kids who are here too. My family is my main priority and when I get out I will make sure I get back on track for my family. So I can have the laughs I want now. In the @ DATE1 I would never have guessed that I would be where I am now, but when I get home I'm going to put a smile on my brothers and parents' faces and when I see my daughter, I'm gonna give her the biggest smoochie kiss of her life to make her cry and laugh.

The @ CAPS1-inspiring, @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 from @ CAPS4 I @ CAPS5 the @ CAPS6 from @ CAPS7 - @ PERSON1. What exactly is @ CAPS13 ? Some might say, "@ CAPS8, that's obvious. @ CAPS13 is a sound, made by a person when they think something is funny !" It is as good an answer as any, and certainly very credible. But I believe that laughter has a much deeper definition; a definition that can only be explained through a slightly humorous and uninspiring story about my experiences as a basketball player @ CAPS9- @ CAPS10- @ CAPS11. This year, when I was in my second year in high school, I decided to do something that I had never done before : go out for the basketball team. I was inspired by the desire to get more involved in the school district and be able to exercise throughout the rainy winter months when @ CAPS13 was held. Having only picked up a basketball to avoid the sit-out zone at college @ LOCATION1, my performance in early practice was comparable to that of a high school dropout determining the orbit of the planets around the sun ; and at least they have a calculator. Naturally, the year I decided to give basketball a try, the coaches informed us that seven unlucky individuals would be taken off the team with a gleeful abandon. Through determination, I improved enough in our first few weeks to be considered “ better than dirt ” by the coaches ; narrowly avoiding losing my place in the team. In the months to come, I would learn that my job wouldn't be to make baskets and steal balls ... As amazing as @ CAPS13 is, my ability to imagine myself playing basketball was far beyond my real field skills. I soon discovered that my place on the team wouldn't aggressively run up and down the field fighting for control of an orange ball; I would be on the sidelines, my cheeks firmly planted on the bench where my teammates were taking their breath before returning to the action. Our team could play basketball, but not often at the same level as the teams we were up against. As each match came and went, I could see the fighting spirit coming out of the eyes of my peers; their morale was just down, and no amount of my ball game skills could change that. @ CAPS13 was a game in particular when I discovered that I didn't have to play to help my team. @ CAPS13 was a home game, in our lower gym; we were down about @ NUM1 points against a team we had beaten @ CAPS8 against before. Needless to say, the players were getting very frustrated. One of our star players, @ PERSON2, was getting so frustrated that our coaches decided to take him off for a break. He was enraged, spitting curses. He sank down onto the bench with the elegance of an enraged walrus. Her mother came down from the stands to give her water, which only embarrassed her more. Sitting next to @ PERSON2, I could feel the anger radiating from him. He was yelling in a low voice on the number @ NUM2, the leader of the opposing team. I noticed that while @ NUM2's quick legs and quick hands made him an excellent ball player, his voice - a good octave above his teammates - was much more suited to @ CAPS8 to cover songs from @ ORGANIZATION1 only to call parts. I turned to @ PERSON2, patting his shoulder and informed him of my point of view. He looked at me for a moment, a mixture of angst and "don't-talk-to-me-or-I-will-kill- @ CAPS12" on his face before he burst out laughing. Slapping me on the back, he said with a smile: "@ CAPS12 always knows @ CAPS4 to make us laugh, @ PERSON1". Suddenly @ CAPS13 dawned on me that my dripping jokes and sarcasm were quite often the only thing that made my teammates smile. I was able to use @ CAPS7 to broadcast tense situations and allow emotions to flow freely in a more positive way. We have lost the game. In fact, we have lost all but one game all season; and so i made @ CAPS13 my personal duty to keep the whole team in a good mood, even in the worst of times. Over the weeks, I started to feel more and more part of the team; making teammates laugh kept their minds clear of anger and frustration and allowed them to play to the best of their ability. And so @ CAPS13 was. Some players had quick hands, others had flawless shots. Me? I made people laugh. I have given my peers, my friends, the ability to see the light even in the most extreme situations. I did not receive an award, recognition of athletic ability. Instead, I found the satisfaction of making people smile, seeing the enraged despair on their faces disappear - replaced by optimism and hope. Laughter is what pushed my teammates beyond anger, to be the best they can be. So @ CAPS12 says to me : is laughter just a noise a person makes when something is funny, or is @ CAPS13 something more ? Spoiler alert : @ CAPS13 is much more.

 Laughter plays an important role in everyone's life. Different laughs represent different things. For example, has @ CAPS2 ever heard someone laugh and immediately know they are sarcastic, or maybe even sympathetic ? A laugh can say a lot. I'm going to tell @ CAPS2 the time my friend fell into a pond @ NUM1. At the start of @ DATE1 my friend was visiting me at my house for a week. On the third morning of his stay we woke up and it had snowed seven inches @ TIME1. I was used to the soft white flakes spiraling up in the air, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 was from @ LOCATION1 and had never seen snow before. As my friend listed all the things @ CAPS1 wanted to do that day, @ CAPS1 let out the most anxious laugh I have ever heard. I could tell @ CAPS1 just wanted to hang out at this point. Of course @ CAPS1 knew it was going to be cold, but I didn't think @ CAPS1 knew how cold it was. I told him it would be colder than @ CAPS1 expected. We dressed in several layers of clothing: socks, pants, shirts and jackets to be able to go out. As we walked down the snowy hill, @ CAPS1 spotted @ NUM1's pond on the lower half of my property and rushed over to it. @ CAPS1 asked if we could go swimming, I laughed sarcastically and said "shit no!" @ CAPS1 walked over to a huge log lying on the water and decided to cross it. @ CAPS1 said if I didn't go with her, @ CAPS1 would push me inside. So I stepped back, @ CAPS1 just looked down and kept walking. As @ CAPS1 was walking on the frozen log with ice cream, @ CAPS1 got a little cocky and decided to jump in to show me that it was "fun". I laughed at the funny moves of @ CAPS1 and whispered, "@ CAPS2 is going to fall." All of a sudden @ CAPS1 slipped and the ice cracked. It reminded me of broken glass on a cement floor. This image in front of me was almost as if it were in slow motion; I remember his hands reaching out to grab the log before @ CAPS1 fell into the icy water. @ CAPS1 fell into the water, I jumped on @ TIME1 to help her, slowly pulled her out of the pond. I looked at her after I speared the log and we both burst out laughing ... even though her teeth were chattering and her multiple layers of clothes were soaking wet I knew @ CAPS1 was @ CAPS3 who was going to treasure this moment because it was his first snow experience. Walking home, @ CAPS1 chuckled, "I should have listened to @ CAPS2 huh ?" I nodded and suggested we take her clothes off, ring the bell and put them in the dryer. We put on our pajamas and sipped hot chocolate and coffee all day, sharing laughs and smiles. I will remember @ CAPS3 from that day because there were so many different stories I can tell.

 Laughter forms a bond between two people; a good laugh can turn an uncomfortable situation into a pleasant one. A fantastic example of the power of laughter would be when I first met my mom's boyfriend. My father died when I was thirteen and since then I have stubbornly resented every new man my mother tried to bring into my life. This rock-solid resolve came to an end when my two sisters and I sat down to dinner with @ ORGANIZATION1. A @ DATE1 @ TIME1, my mom announced that she invited her new boyfriend to meet her kids. My sisters and I had to clean the house from top to bottom in order to get our guest ready, while my mom made a giant pot of lasagna. When the house was clean and dinner was cooked, I dressed for this most painful occasion. My obsessive-compulsive mother made me change my clothes at least thirty times before she deemed me presentable enough to meet the man whose existence I was beginning to despise. At six-thirty sharp in @ TIME2, @ PERSON1's blue @ ORGANIZATION2 pulled up in our driveway. I gave my mother a steel look as I opened the door for the jester; thus, a most dreaded dinner began. My determined hatred started to subside as soon as I saw @ PERSON1, but it was by no means expired. @ PERSON1 was tall and tanned, a few years older than my mom judging by his wrinkled skin and the silver stripes through his dark hair and matching mustache. He had a friendly and pleasant appearance which immediately made him likable. My now dizzy mother and her brooding children sat down to eat with the happy stranger. My younger sister warmed up with him first. She and @ PERSON1 share a love of snakes, lizards and everything that I consider "spooky". A common interest brought them together before I knew it. My older sister was loving @ PERSON1 after a heated soccer chat. @ PERSON1 and my sister discovered that they were both fans of @ CAPS1 and therefore formed a bond with their team. After conquering my siblings, @ PERSON1 tried to charm me into loving him. He tried to talk about movies, music, sports, animals, even politics, but nothing he said could melt my icy temper. I was determined to hate him from the start of @ TIME2, and no charisma would break my lingering stubbornness. Eventually he gave up on me and focused on entertaining the people who loved him. Over dessert, he embarked on a stand-up comedy cleverly disguised as a story about his recent flight to @ LOCATION1. He talked about the ridiculous security checks, overly cheerful flight attendants who genuinely hate their jobs, and cheesy security videos. I had tears in my eyes before I remembered that I had made a solemn vow to hate @ PERSON1. I fought hard to get back to my old behavior, but my willpower didn't stand a chance against @ ORGANIZATION1's sense of humor. The triumphant smile and elegant wink he gave me from across the table told me he won. Sure enough, we were best friends before the night was over. Eventually @ PERSON1 and I chatted about movies and music and found out that we had similar tastes in the two, but our common interests had nothing to do with our friendship. They just kept the fire going. The power of laughter has brought us together like a magnet and a puck. Just as the shortest distance between the dots is a straight line, laughter was the straight line between me and @ PERSON1. He and my mom are always together, and since entering our lives, laughter has been our constant companion.

 A @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 The @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 was a warm @ DATE1 @ CAPS1, some of my friends and I had planned to do a @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 on @ CAPS3. We had decided to walk around and look @ CAPS2 for all the cool stores. Eventually we were all going to have lunch and go out to the park by the river right next to @ CAPS3. We all agreed that @ CAPS4 was a great plan and that we would all have a wonderful @ CAPS1. To begin with, we all met @ CAPS2 the bus stop near the cinema. @ PERSON3, @ PERSON4, @ PERSON2, @ CAPS5 and I were all there. We decided to go look inside @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 first as they have all the crazy things we love. Inside the store, I found a dress to die for. @ CAPS4 was small and gray with skulls all over the place @ CAPS4. Unfortunately @ CAPS4 cost @ MONEY1 which I didn't have, so we left @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7. Then we went to @ NUM1 @ CAPS10 to see what they had in store for us. @ PERSON3 and I created a black @ PERSON1 teddy with a studded leather jacket. We gave @ CAPS4 a great top hat and named @ CAPS4 @ CAPS11 @ PERSON1. We all thought @ CAPS4 was pretty funny because teddy bears are meant to be cute and this one was pretty scary. We paid @ MONEY2 for @ CAPS4 and continued our little adventure. We all decided @ CAPS4 was over for lunch, so we picked up some Chinese food from @ ORGANIZATION1, left @ CAPS3, and headed to the park next to the river. Before arriving at the park, we stopped to go see what @ CAPS4 looked like under the bridge. There were rock towers everywhere so we decided to build one ourselves. We stacked @ CAPS4 almost as high as I did before @ CAPS4 collapsed, almost crushing @ PERSON4 on the way down. We followed the small path away from the rock towers to the river. @ CAPS4 takes us to a small beach by the water. There was a huge pillar separating the trees and bushes from the water. We decided to have lunch here instead of going to the park. After having lunch, we were again full of energy. @ CAPS5 started a pine cone war by tagging me on the back of my head with a. After a few minutes we were all involved. We used the giant pillar of the bridge as a shield but @ CAPS4 didn't quite work. @ PERSON4, who had a better goal than the rest of us, was hitting everyone left and right, so the rest of us teamed up with him. We all threw pinecones one after the other until @ PERSON4 had to start backing away. When he reached the edge of the shore, he tripped over a large boulder and fell backwards into the shallow water. Instantly we all burst out laughing which continued for a good few minutes before @ CAPS5 finally decided to help @ PERSON4 out of the water. He was very unhappy with the situation while we were all very happy. Jesica had managed to get a video of the set and when we replayed @ CAPS4 to @ PERSON4 he couldn't help but laugh with us. After that, we went to the park. Immediately we all ran for the slide. " I want to go first !" " Shouted @ PERSON3 while we were all up CAPS4 @ jim jungle to slide. We all pushed and pushed to get to the slide before I finally suggested going down the big, whirling slide all together. Everyone thought @ CAPS4 was a great idea, so we gave @ CAPS4 a try. @ PERSON3 was first, as she wanted, I was second, followed by @ PERSON2, @ PERSON4, then @ CAPS5. We started very slowly and progressed quickly as more of us piled onto the slide. We ended up in a bunch @ CAPS2 downstairs, all laughing in historic ways. When we all came back to reality we realized that @ CAPS4 was time to come home, so we all grabbed our things and headed for the bus stop. In the end, @ CAPS4 turned out to be an even better @ CAPS1 than we expected. Everyone @ CAPS1 was full of joy and laughter which are some of the key aspects of life. Seriously, there would be no way to @ ORGANIZATION1 when you are extremely happy or when you think something is funny. Happiness is one thing you need in order to live a fun and fulfilling life. I feel like the ability to laugh is one thing that makes a person fun. Do you think you laugh often enough?

The time I went to @ CAPS1-wheeling ! Once when I went to @ CAPS1-wheeling with @ PERSON3, @ PERSON5, @ PERSON1, @ PERSON4 and I went up to @ ORGANIZATION1. It is a question of who was in which trucks. It was @ PERSON2 and me in my @ CAPS2 @ NUM1, @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON4 in his tracker @ NUM1, and @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON5 in his traction jeep @ NUM3 @ CAPS3. When we started to come down the mountain, @ PERSON3 let @ PERSON5 go down. @ PERSON5 cannot see very well at night because she wears glasses and her eyesight is not very good. Well I was following them down the mountain and we finally got to the sidewalk and @ PERSON5 was going pretty fast for this road because it is a narrow winding road and it was the first time she was there before . She went into a very tight turn and got up on two wheels and rolled over right in front of me, so I had to apply the brakes to not hit them. So I stopped my truck by running over there as fast as I could and helped @ PERSON5 out of the truck and when I turned to go help @ PERSON3 he is already on top of the truck. He is looking @ PERSON5 and said "@ CAPS4 look what you did to my truck, I tried several times to roll it and I could never damn you!". So we all started laughing, and then I pulled a chain out of the back of my truck and backed it up. Then it was really quiet and @ PERSON4 farted and we all started laughing again. Well @ PERSON3 found out he had a hole in his radiator, I had to take him home and it seemed like the longest ride ever because his truck weighs a lot more than mine, j So had to take it home in the wheel @ CAPS1 drive and you can't go over thirty in pull @ CAPS1 because things can break. So we finally get to his house and his dad comes out and he saw the truck and was really pissed off because he gave her that truck for a graduation present and he messed it up. Then he finally calmed down because he said no one was hurt and he was happy with it, so we went into the house, had dinner and went to bed. So the moral of the story is to be very careful because things can happen when they are unexpected.

 We all know the benefits of laughter. Many people believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. Is there anything else to laugh about? Can a person be happy without laughing? I never went a day without laughing. I know the benefits of laughter. Do you? I know the benefits of laughter. It's really amazing how something so simple can bring people together, make friends and mend relationships, or make someone's day a little better if they're going through a tough time. There was a time when, in third grade, my best friend and I had a fight because I hadn't asked him to be on our basketball team for a tournament that was held once a year. After talking about it, and my best friend made a few jokes, that had settled everything. What I mean is laughter can release tension, not make everything so serious. Laughing can also help you make new friends. All over the world, a single laugh can bring two or more people together. What about the enemies? Laughter might show you something that you like about that person that you don't really like. Laughter is also great for your health, and it's a proven fact.

 Laughter is the most important part when you meet other people. Even a slight smile can change the image of an entire person. Sometimes people practice their laughter to get a better image of themselves. I believe that each person contains their own personality in their laughter. How you laugh is the way to express how you are feeling. For example, you can say that you are not comfortable laughing nervously, or you can say that it was not really funny by sarcasm by laughing without any tone or emotion like a robot. You can say a lot of things while laughing. Usually, friendships are formed automatically when two people have something in common and are in agreement. And a laugh is the best way to agree with someone else. As @ CAPS1, I had a hard time expressing my emotions with my laughter. As I know, a lot of @ CAPS2 people don't know that @ CAPS1 can't smile as well as white people because their facial muscles are not very developed. This is why others think @ CAPS4 is always angry and doesn't like humor. Because of this, I had a lot of misunderstandings about my laughter. When I laugh, I don't seem to laugh, which makes for an unnatural laugh. When I first got here it was in the middle of semester and I couldn't speak @ CAPS5 as well as I do now. I didn't have any friends at all. It has been a very difficult job to befriend someone without knowing what they know or what their sense of humor is. In @ LOCATION1 I usually made friends by making them laugh, but here I didn't know how to make them laugh. I had to listen to them quietly what they were laughing about, and I had to find out what kind of humor they had. Finally, when I made a friend, I still couldn't laugh. I didn't understand any of the words they were talking about. I didn't know when to laugh and where to laugh. It sounds pretty silly when I look back now, but I was really serious. I really missed @ LOCATION1 where I had friends that I can understand and laugh together. Living without a sense of humor made me very depressed. I suddenly stopped laughing because I thought laughing alone would sound silly. I kept looking for the culture of this country and tried to watch more TV to find out what they have in mind. And then I finally understood those slang words they were using and I could laugh when others laughed. I was really happy. I was so happy to be able to make others laugh. I made a lot of friends and laughed with them. But I still couldn't understand some of the languages or other things they were laughing at, but I would just laugh when they laughed. It made me feel like I was one of them when I laughed with them, and I was really happy about it. There was research on laughter and life, and she said you live longer when you laugh more. They say even a fake laugh can trick your brain and it can be healthy. Then I saw a doctor who can only heal people with laughter. There are groups of people who laugh together to be healthy. They come together and laugh. It was really weird when I first saw this group on @ CAPS6, but saw people's efforts to be healthy. I figured that fake laughter made everyone happy and that laughter could cover up everyone's mistakes. I also told myself that there are still many ways to laugh in this world. With a little laugh, or even a fake laugh, we can create a better society and live a better life.

 A lot of people like to laugh and others don't like it as much. I am one of those people who love to laugh and will laugh when my @ CAPS1 tells a really good joke. I think it's important to laugh because it feels good, it gives the impression that everything is fine. The people you can laugh with the most are obviously your @ CAPS1. When you are feeling down who is there to support you, your @ CAPS1 are and what they are trying to do is make you laugh. My best friend @ PERSON3 and I have a tendency to always laugh, especially if we have a class together, it's all about laughing. We have fun in class, we pay attention but we just make it interesting and we laugh so much that it can distract others. Our second year teacher @ PERSON1 always told us that we laugh a lot and that is a good thing. She also told us that she had never seen someone laugh so much in her class. For example, that year we were studying vocabulary and when @ PERSON3 and I saw the word face we started laughing so much because it means face and it reminded us of the @ CAPS1 TV show. Every time that word came up during that week, we laughed so hard that our stomachs started to ache. His face was turning as red as a tomato and I couldn't even say a word. Even now that we are juniors we still remember it and we start to laugh so hard that if I get up I will drop to the ground and move my feet like I was hitting something. Now is when my @ CAPS1 start laughing more because they say I'm hilarious. @ PERSON3 and I are the kind of people who if something is very boring to us then there has to be a way to make it fun. Some teachers like it when we actually have fun in their classroom, but others don't like it at all. Like last year in @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 our teacher @ PERSON2 totally panicked because @ PERSON3 and I were laughing. We were careful but we only laughed when we did our job but he didn't like it. For us this class was extremely boring and we just made it fun, but @ PERSON2 decided to do a sit board. Well, you would think that by having a board sit @ PERSON3 and I wouldn't talk or laugh at all, but that didn't happen. That didn't stop him or me from talking to the people around us. We would talk to them and make the class fun. When he thought we were not paying attention, he would ask us questions and we would answer them correctly. Even though @ PERSON3 and I were sitting far away from each other we were moving our hands until we got each other's attention and then we started to laugh because we looked funny to do all of this without saying a word. Every day when my @ CAPS1 and I have lunch at school at our usual place, we are still laughing. People who don't really know me think I'm crazy or weird but I say I'm just myself and very optimistic. @ PERSON3 and I say "@ CAPS4 sad panda today" we say that when we see that one of our @ CAPS1 is calm or looks sad. The strangest thing is that when @ PERSON3 and I are laughing at the same time, it looks like a single laugh. The first time we realized we were having the same laughter, we started laughing more than we could even breathe. Laughing is important because it feels good and you feel relieved even if you are having a really bad day, as health professors say, it takes more muscles to frown than to smile.

 Laughter is used as a "cure" for everything. Throughout life, people underestimate the power of laughter. Laughter and joy have always been my personal way of getting to know others better. Personally, I use laughter to create a connection that another person and I can make on a level where we can share our thoughts and feelings through laughter. Laughter is very important in life. Laughter can help someone find people who have similar and common interests, laughter can build good relationships between compatible people and help create stories that are explained later in life. Throughout life, there will always be that person or group of people who can benefit from similar things. I have been involved in a lot of social groups. In most of these groups, laughter is a common thing among all of these groups. Without this similar interest, laughter would not exist throughout life. Laughter helps in everyday life. People find these common interests between people and start to create relationships between people that did not exist before. These relationships can be demonstrated by colleagues, authority figures, friends and family throughout everyday life. Someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. Relationships between people are built on laughter and the pleasure of being with other people. These relationships are formed at the social level with friendly people. Without these relationships, people would never have good times throughout their lives. These relationships are created to help introduce the stories of life. In my life, I have had bad times and good times. The bad times that have happened in my life are the death of a member of my family. My great-grandparents on both sides of my family are deceased. Another horrible thing that has happened in my life is that a friend of mine died at a young age. What happened was that he was driving an all-terrain vehicle. But the good things in my life were breathtaking. The one thing that has been breathtaking in my life is most of my conversations with my friends. Laughter is the key point of the conversation. When I started my relationship with @ PERSON1 all I could think of was being able to enjoy the time I spent with her. The first day we started spending time together, we couldn't stop laughing. Everything I said or something she did was hilarious to me. The most common thing we had in common was laughter. In every basketball game, we tried to spend as much time as possible together. We try to get to know each other a little better by finding common interests through laughter because, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." Laughter can help someone find people who have common interests, laughter can build good relationships between compatible people and help create stories that are explained later in life. Laughter is used on a personal level to connect with that person. Laughter can be used in everyday life. Laughter is part of a relationship that should always exist.

 An argument is defined as " a discussion in which disagreement is expressed ". In many cases, a proverbial "@ CAPS1" is created between the two conflicting parties. Without a way to bridge this gap, the two groups, or individuals, will fail to come to a settlement and continue to argue until one or the other backs down and accepts the other's point of view. Laughter can serve as a bridge. The door slammed and I went straight to my room. I had returned home after what started out as a great time with one of my oldest friends. Looking back, I don't remember what it was all about, all I knew was that I was never going to talk to him again; but being as young as I am, these thoughts rarely last. I saw him every day during the school week, but it didn't matter if he was there or not. He was away from me as long as we fought. It seemed like a good plan, ignoring each other completely until we calmed down, but as with any plan, things never go as smoothly as you want, especially when you're in the same elementary school, and in the same classify. In elementary school, or at least in my case, there were a lot of group activities, and when you're paired up with the person you're not on good terms with, things get difficult. Whether it's building something, writing together, or solving a math problem in a group, communication and teamwork are both important, and our fights haven't affected the group well. We would each discuss the best way to complete the task at hand with another member of the group that we were not fighting with, then they would discuss and consult with each other separately. In short, it was a mess, and much more difficult than it should have been. Outside the classroom, the fighting continued. At recess, we would not agree to be on the same team, or even on the same side of the field as each other. After about a week of this I realized it had to stop. At recess I tried to get him to talk about our problem instead of yelling at him or ignoring him. The calm resolution of the problem started off well, but being kids ended in a screaming match, to which I lost. I started to wonder if we were ever going to fix this problem. When I got home that day, my mom, being a mom and always knowing when something's wrong, asked me what was bothering me. At first I was reluctant to explain things, but being a mother she convinced me to tell her. She started to say how much more mature I must be and that we need to calmly talk about our differences, which I had already tried. I started ignoring him and imagined my friend's mother was giving him the exact same speech. When she was done, all I got from the lecture was that I had to try again. The next day at recess I searched for him with the intention of fixing things today no matter what. When I found it and tried to speak it turned into a screaming match again. Friends nearby started to rush and we continued. Suddenly, in the midst of the screams, my friend, with whom I had been fighting for a few weeks, started to laugh. I was taken aback and thought about what could have happened to make angry screams turn into laughter. Looking around, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary, just a few sniggering passers-by. I recalled what had just happened in my head. Just as I got to the point where he was starting to laugh, I realized I had inadvertently made a joke while we were yelling at each other. This awareness made me laugh, and everyone nearby laughed. After we stopped laughing, we sat down and chatted about things as we should have been from the start. We wondered why we were always fighting for something so insignificant and insignificant as this. After about five minutes of chatting, we agreed to still be friends and try to chat in the future before yelling at each other. When a teacher whistled and recess was over, I returned to class feeling happy and relieved that we had finally sorted things out and could continue to be friends. If I hadn't made this joke in the middle of our fight, I don't know if we would have reconciled, even if we had realized how pointless it was. Laughing during an argument won't solve your problems for you. However, laughter can bridge the @ CAPS1 and provide a common ground in which @ MONTH1 issues will be resolved.

                                        Laughs @ CAPS1 I first meet someone, there is always a small wall to climb before I can really get to know each other: @ CAPS2 laugh. I have this weird, awkward nervous laugh, almost like a chuckle, that I can't even hear. Others do, however. Especially when they first meet me. I think most of the time it helps people get to know me faster. But other times I think it's a hindrance to getting to know me. When someone first meets me, they always comment on @ CAPS2's laugh. Either they seem slightly baffled by this, or they open up easily and joke with me. They always talk to me about it: @ CAPS3 it's strange, @ CAPS3 I do it a lot, what it looks like, etc. As if I had never told me about it before. But it's good. I don't hear it coming out and I don't mind being said. I don't really think that's a bad thing. When they seem baffled by @ CAPS2's laughter, I get more embarrassed and try to control it, but I usually end up doing it even more. If that seems to make them laugh and they don't laugh at me for it, I just let him out, and it becomes very easy to get to know this person. I never really realized @ CAPS3 was bad, until a weekend at the beach. I was on a beach retreat with the @ CAPS2 youth group and one of the activities was a video scavenger hunt. We toured the city and took videos of different things, actions, situations and people. One of those things we had to have a video of was one of us playing paper scissors with a stranger. So I quickly approached two older women and asked them to play a game with them. When we all watched the videos later I saw and heard just @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2's voice, laughter and weird ways with strangers. I had been told about it from time to time, but I had never seen it. It was strange! Another situation was to work at @ LOCATION1 this @ DATE1. When we played icebreaker games to break tensions and meet the people from our teams more easily. Everyone on the @ CAPS2 team looked a little weird to me. I couldn't understand why, until someone stepped in and was blunt: and told me about the laughter from @ CAPS2. During the first week, I was the person who knew everyone on the team the best. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It can be quickly filled or increased: according to @ CAPS3, people are reacting to it. If they join in, the distance is destroyed. When, however, one person does not join in the laughter, or enjoy the other person's laughter, this distance is greatly increased. It becomes difficult to cross that distance, and the chance to do so is probably lost. And that's just a shame. We should all be able to laugh together and share in each other's joy.

 Whenever I walk down the hall and see a couple, they are laughing together or doing other things that might disqualify my test. I know for a fact that the people who were voted for the cutest couple in our school are the laughing ones as opposed to the later ones. Laughter not only creates couples, then families and ultimately the next generation, but it creates friendships within schools, families, activities, etc. This is why I personally think that laughing is the most powerful action a person can do. Everyone I'm friends with laughed with me and vice versa. Mostly a friend that I've grown even closer to since we first met. I was very determined to go to church when I was young. I have always been shy and the church allows me to be social with others without crosshairs. However, I saw a girl sitting in the back corner who I thought was scared, just as I probably would have been if it was elsewhere. My parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to do my best to meet new people. I did it maybe for the first time in my life to say "hello" to her. She answered me by giving me her name. However, I returned to my shyness and came back terrified of talking to her again or to someone else. However, I was only in third grade when this all happened, so over time things changed. About @ NUM1 years after that, a new church opened with a new classroom open to children of all age groups. I had cemented myself in that classroom as one of the two who showed up regularly. However, that day I was the only one there for my age group. Well, actually I was the only one in my age group to be there on time. I saw a girl come in with her father and you could tell she had forced her to go to class. It took me a while to imagine who it was, but I finally realized who it was. It was the girl who was afraid to be in church and now it was the girl who was afraid to be in class. She could clearly recognize me. I waved my hand for him to come in. Then you saw her smile. She quickly laughed a little. It was then that I realized I had met someone special. Now every time I see her she smiles. This is how I know she will be a friend for a long time. Laughter can't be put in quotes, but it can be remembered by someone for the rest of your life. I know this for a fact because many days have passed since then and I still have these memories. Laughing is the easiest way to tell if a person is a true friend, something more, or should and will be forgotten.

I was hanging out with my friends and we were sitting in the park just talking about life and school. when we got home. So we got tired and lay down in the grass and looked at the clouds. with the clouds as they passed us, we enjoyed ourselves so much to lie down there, laughing and watching the clouds go by. So we got home, drank some water and went to the bathroom, then we played the Wii and laughed some more, it was fun. Laughter is like medicine, it makes everything bad look better and just helps you feel good when you are depressed you just have to find something that makes you happy and that will make you laugh for life. is not the same without laughing it helps the the world go round and round. Do you like to laugh and dose it up helps you feel better when you are depressed and not sure what to do there are ways to feel better and help you get far with your life and can just put a smile on your face. faces of others on his pleasure to make others feel good.

 Once, a long time ago, I laughed so hard with a friend, when a child fell to the ground falling and started to cry. There was water on the ground and it was soaked. The janitor wiped the floor with water. the kid paid no attention to the janitor at all. The janitor was a mean person too, he was angry with the boy for stealing stuff from the school janitor's closet. The boy was also angry because the janitor was mean to him. I was in class @ NUM1 and I didn't know any better. I had to say I was sorry because the teacher caught my friend laughing and told me the boy was not mentally well or stable. I felt bad and apologized right away. I told the kid I didn't mean anything by that, that it was just a reaction. The boy was able to laugh at himself and he and I became friends. I feel that this little event in my life is changing me for the better. I'm not so quick to laugh at other people's plight @ CAPS1, people are stupid all over the world, no one is perfect. Everyone is different and unique in their own way. The world will never be as one, theirs will always be war all the time forever on earth.

 One time that laughter was in one of my relationships was when I was in the trash and my cousin made me smile. It was a rainy @ DATE1 @ TIME1 and I just woke up, my dad asked me to make him some breakfast; As I was making the hash browns, eggs and toast, I thought about how little my dad and I spent together, and how unstable and rocky our father-daughter relationship was and thought about things we could do together. When I brought him breakfast I came up with the idea of going to the movies, he said he would think about it and told me to go start my chores. When I was finally done I went to Facebook and talked to my cousin @ CAPS1; I told him how excited I was to go to the movies with my dad and that we were finally spending more time together. At five in the afternoon, I went upstairs to speak to my father. I asked him what time we were going to be leaving, he said around eight o'clock and that's when I got the feeling we weren't going to leave after all. I left her room and went down the stairs only to find myself swollen with tears; I curled up in my @ CAPS2-boy chair in the living room and waited for eight o'clock to arrive. When the time came I was full of disappointment, and my dad said we would go the next day but he would bring a friend. Because her friend was going to see her daughter (and also my friend since the age of three) at her gymnastics competition, I had no problem seeing the competition or her. I had a problem with someone else coming with my dad and me to the movies. Although I wanted to spend some quality time with him; it upset me that my dad didn't want to spend quality time with me, we barely spoke and it's hard to do when living under the same roof. I went back down the stairs and got back in my chair and cried and decided that it had to be my fault and that I had done something wrong. So I got up and talked to someone I know who could help me get out of the dumps. He's one of the only people I really enjoy talking to, and someone who knows me very well. He's my cousin, we have a very strong relationship that almost only has laughter. At first he tried to reassure me but it didn't work, so he did something he knows best, he made me laugh by doing or saying random nonsense; he even said he would eat my poor little kitten if I didn't smile for him. That's when I started laughing and he continued to make me laugh, until the only tears I cried while trying to breathe. He's always been the one who can always reverse my frown. And I can do the same for him, he @ MONTH1 be my cousin but he is also my best friend and it makes me feel the love I need from my family that only he can give me, and I hope that I'll never forget or lose that with him. Before I became friends with @ CAPS1, I never thought I would have someone to talk to about my home life. He understands me and what I've been through and knows me as well as I know him and I love it. I could never have asked for better. He's my favorite cousin and the best of my best friends, who loves to talk to me and make me laugh until I try to breathe. I will never forget what he did for me, but it stands out more than every time and I thank him for it. This is so and why laughter has and is an important part in all and in all relationships with and for everyone.

 At a time when laughter was an element or a part, my brother would show my family a YouTube video. The video was about a guy talking about his childhood when his father told him to go to the store to get some bread to make sandwiches for dinner and he was told not to be in trouble. To avoid getting into trouble, her father told her to cross the street because there were three boys down the block who looked like trouble. So he did what his father told him to do and he crossed the street but when he passed the boys they stopped him. One of the boys shouted something and a group of their friends came flying over from a barber shop across the street and surrounded him. He managed to free himself and ran as fast as he could. He said he was running so fast he knew he had passed an @ ORGANIZATION1 because he said he was behind and then in front of the car that was running to get to his house. When he got home he told his dad he did what he said he did. The father only cared if he got the bread and the guy was upset that his father cared for the bread for him. The way the guy recounted his childhood memory was funny and even though my brother had already shown me the video the day before we both thought it was funny as did my family and we burst out laughing sometimes .

One day my friend and I woke up late that day and his brother walked in screaming and shouting at the top of his lungs "brother brother" ! That was the nickname he called her because he was only two years old, so my friend Spencer calmed him down and we started watching TV. one where we were going to swim later and play a few games now. Spencers' mom asked us when we were going for a swim and should we take her little brother. So we went early so his little brother could swim and we could sit and listen to some music. Unlike anyone who uses an iPod, I use my phone because then I can text and listen to music and when someone calls they mute the music so I know it. It was also a brand new phone and I loved every moment of having it. So when we dropped her little brother off, we also went back to the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. I put my phone on my shirt and my briefcase on both, so when Spencer came out too, used the briefcase, he pulled the towel up and my phone flew off, hit the floor and slipped on the floor. floor to the hot tub. At this point I look down and see it and, weirdly, I took it out, ripped off the back and dried the battery with the tea towel hoping it would still work and it didn't. would not stop dialing zero and nine, so I removed the battery again. When we got back to his moms I plugged in the charger without the battery and Spencer kept saying sorry and I kept saying "it's ok". The next morning her mother asked why we hadn't used a pot of rice and we started to laugh because we had panicked so much on the phone. I forgot everything about the phone after that I kept laughing and the phone worked its one of the funniest stories.

@ DATE1 what a night !! My friends and I were going to a @ CAPS1 party at work from our dance coaches. we had to dress up as elves and play with the kids. It was fun, but once the party was over, that's where the real fun started ! After changing our costumes and putting on our usual clothes, we started taking pictures. @ CAPS3 were funny, cute and weird, all kinds of pictures. Anyway, my friends and I didn't want to come home just yet so we decided to go to some places to take more pictures and have more fun! The first stop was a school playground but we couldn't stay because it was late and we weren't allowed in so we decided to go to the discovery park that I was driving and a friend of mine on the passenger seat was taking pictures which turned out really funny. so when we got to the park my friend taking the pictures said @ CAPS2 am I driving around the parking lot? "I said sure. we changed places and off we went. She was a pretty good driver, but @ CAPS3 was a little scary of the times I felt like we were going to die. Ha ha. So she walked around and then went to the stop sign on a main road where she decided that would be the right time to go back and I was shouting at her "@ CAPS3 is a the car is coming in we have trouble with @ CAPS2, but no she didn't listen to me she got out so I had to get out and we got out of there were screaming at it and my friends in the back seat were also screaming not because we were crazy but we didn't want to get caught and we had a lot of fun. So I go back to the driver's seat and we all scream "get in the car" but she laughs out loud as she says "I wet my pants." We all started laughing because we thought she was joking but oh no she was serious she was laughing so hard that she wet her pants! It was a good thing she had extra pants with her. So I had to back the car up so that it could change behind this big metal thing. While she was changing, we thought it would be really funny if we got a pic of her changing. she was laughing so hard we teased her by saying "keep it". We still tease her a lot about it even though it's been two months. Every time we laugh out loud and someone says "oh I think I'm going to pee in my pants" we look at @ PERSON1 and say "@ PERSON1 knows what it is" we have too much fun at the tease about what she did. the next day we go tell the rest of our friends who weren't with us what happened and they all started laughing as loud as us. At the time she wasn't in the room with us when we told the rest of our friends but when she walked in and we all stopped and saw her it was really hard to keep from laughing. now everyone knows about that night and the @ PERSON1 "crash". every now and then we laugh at her, but she laughs because we all know it could've been any of us. It still makes me laugh today, not as much as when it really happened, but you @ CAPS2 still laugh about it every now and then. "

 A @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 For me, laughter is an integral part of life. I cannot and do not want to escape it. @ CAPS1 is fun on its own. It always makes tense situations relaxed and enjoyable. No feeling is more perfect than falling head first into uncontrollable laughter. @ CAPS1 is the best way to unite people and make memories and bonds. In my home and family, too many situations arise that cause the potential, and often the result, to laugh. It's the same with my distant families and my friends at school. Life growing up with a brother, wonderfully entertaining neighbors and cousins have produced most of my memories @ CAPS1. One of those moments, where laughter flowed, happened quite recently. The situation started when my brother, @ PERSON1, had to do a homework assignment. @ PERSON1 has been instructed by his history teacher to write a diary entry as if he were a mountaineer in @ DATE1. I had no intention of helping him with his homework, but considering the end result, I was very glad I did. It seemed so unlikely that this task would be so fun. I guess this shows how laughter can crop up so suddenly and in such unpredictable places. I walked into @ PERSON1's bedroom and he told me what he was working on, so I leaned over his shoulder and helped him with some ideas. We were moving forward and once we got to a certain point we both contributed a subtle humorous comment that we decided to add to the entry. On reading our creation, nothing less than an explosion of laughter was triggered. Noise poured out of @ PERSON1's room like lava from a volcano ! My parents could hear us and probably thought we were crazy! Another person reading our literature might not have laughed at all, but for us it was hilarious. Being in a good mood and considering that @ PERSON1's history teacher said the entries were creative, more humorous and quite witty phrases were added. At that point, I was having a hard time speaking through all the @ CAPS1 that were consuming me. @ PERSON1 was hardly better. Homework had been more fun with @ CAPS3. We finished faster than if @ PERSON1 was working alone and we left with the greatest feeling. @ PERSON1 ended up getting all the points on the entry when he made him his teacher. This is just one of thousands I could think of that laughs @ CAPS4 right now. This particular example helped at work and yet @ CAPS4 work is not a chore, but rather an extremely happy event. Maybe more laughs in the workplace would lead to better production. All things considered, laughter, in my opinion, makes the best @ CAPS2.

 I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship. In all of my relationships, whether it's friends, family or a girlfriend, laughter is always an important part of each of them. the best relationship i have is with my best friend @ PERSON1 and it is full of laughs. We always have a great time together, like the last @ DATE1 when she and I went to the top of the snow with friends and tore my knee ligaments when I jumped @ PERSON2's quad. We laughed that I'm being stupid and hurt for it and we laughed at @ CAPS1's big ears and how they make him look like @ CAPS2 the elephant. I think what makes us so close and good friends is how much we make each other laugh. The first time we met she was dating a friend of mine and the first thing I did was make her laugh and since then we've been great friends. Then she asked me if I wanted to work at the harvest festival, along with her and I did and it made her laugh all the time. Now I'm her asshole and she's my best friend. The most important thing I did to make her laugh at the harvest festival was when I did a convertible in the tractor all over the track with a cowboy hat and a huge @ dip. LOCATION1 in my lip. The moral of this story is that the more you make people laugh, the stronger and closer your relationships will be, whether with friends, family, or someone close to you.

            Just One @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 A @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 the @ DATE1 of us, @ PERSON2, @ LOCATION1 and I are walking under the cover of trees, we decided to stop by the lake, in our place of usual meeting where we have a perfect view, to discuss. @ LOCATION1, who is six feet @ DATE1, has long raven black hair that barely tickles her chin, deep blue eyes, and is extremely attractive, sprawled out in the damp green grass. But @ PERSON2, who is six feet tall, has short brown hair, dark ocher eyes, chose to stand about @ DATE1 in front of us. For anyone passing by, he would have looked @ CAPS5 if he had just enjoyed the amazing view of the crystal clear water, but for us who knew him too well, knew he was thinking of his brother, @ PERSON1, who was in the hospital. @ PERSON1 had been in the wrong place at the wrong time, got into the middle of a homeless brawl, not to mention the guy was drunk and stabbed with a rusty blade switch. @ PERSON2 felt like it was his fault that this had happened, and it made him so depressed that he didn't want @ CAPS1 to any of our nonsense, or even eat for that matter. Feeling @ PERSON2 this way made @ LOCATION1 and I feel completely horrible and there was nothing we could do to cheer him up. @ PERSON2 was generally the most rambunctious of all of us, and we went out of our way to make him feel better or, at the very least, bring him back to @ CAPS1. But not once did we get him to move, or even get a chuckle out of his clenched jaw. None of our pathetic attempts even touched his eyes, but we never gave up, in fact, we tried for days to make him smile again. We got to the point of desperation that we even dressed @ CAPS5 teletubies, went to @ PERSON2, dragged him off his couch, and took him to town. Yet not a second of that caused her mouth to even contract upward. While we did some of the most outrageous and incredibly embarrassing things we could think of, and trust me, we thought about it for days. We got absolutely no response from him, other than, of course, his huge yawns. Finally, about @ DATE1, we made him laugh, which eventually turned into a full, shaking body @ CAPS1. You'll never guess what finally made it crack. @ CAPS6- @ CAPS6 joke. Of all the horribly heinous deeds we had done, it was the cheesy and silly @ CAPS6- @ CAPS6 jokes that got there. Although @ LOCATION1 and I felt like complete idiots, we couldn't help but @ CAPS1 with him. After that day, it was no longer a difficult process for him. @ PERSON2 was almost, but not quite, back to normal. Our lives therefore continued and @ PERSON1 came out of the hospital perfectly.

 Sometimes life is complicated. Nothing is ever black and white. Here is a brief overview of my childhood. I think the best place to start is the beginning. When I was about @ NUM1, I got my first memory. My dad, @ PERSON3, my brothers and I were all in a pond at @ LOCATION1. We were racing on @ CAPS1 boats that my dad had built. We used to go everyone else @ DATE1 after school, from the time I get out of school until it is so dark outside you can '@ CAPS4 see you hand right in front of your face. Once, I remember going there, that was the time my brother decided I had to go swimming. My brothers and I got along but were never really close to each other. @ CAPS9 loved to play pranks on me since I was the youngest. So I was standing next to my dad and my brother, there was a whole bunch of little ferns around us. My brother @ PERSON2 jumped off one of the bushes behind me and it startled me. Meanwhile, my brother @ PERSON1 was on all fours waiting to jump so he could trip me over him. Well I did, there was a drop off by the pond that nobody really noticed and I got off the hill. My elbow hit my stomach and my head hit a rock, then a @ CAPS2 ! I was now soaked, lying there, a slimy green monster. At the moment no one was laughing, but later we did. The rest of the night, no one really spoke. The sun was just starting to set and I was sitting on the tail of a blanket covered truck as my dad, brothers and @ PERSON3 stood in the setting sun. I will never forget this impending sight. Over the years, things have gradually deteriorated between my brothers and me. Things haven't been so easy at @ CAPS4. There was' @ CAPS4 a forgive and forget. My brother @ PERSON2 is five years older than me. He has @ CAPS3 and serious relationship problems. One day he decided he was going to tell me about his problems. I was about @ NUM2 years old. I loved my brothers and didn't know @ CAPS4 about his ulterior motive at the time. My whole family except my dad was watching @ CAPS4.V. in the living room. My brother @ PERSON2 went back to his room and put Spider Man in his mini player @ CAPS5 and climbed the ladder to his bed. It was a titanium bed with a desk downstairs, the top bed almost ablaze the joint. He left his room and went into the kitchen and refilled his bottle of water. As he was filling his bottle, he asked if anyone wanted to watch Spider Man. Being my mom watching the news, I accepted her offer. We both climbed into the top bunk and watched the movie. We watched it a bit. I was cold so he gave me a blanket that I bought for him last time @ CAPS6. It was fluffy, thick and warm with a huge tiger on it. Like most boys, he slept in boxers and it was a little weird to see him walking around in them. But I never said anything. As we were lying there, he put his hand in my pants. I pushed him away and continued to watch the movie. He tried it a few times, but I would leave it @ CAPS4. I didn't think @ CAPS4 was right. But then he immobilized me with his leg across mine. I shouted @ CAPS4. He started wiggling his finger in my pants, it stung. I told him on purpose to stop he did @ CAPS4. Then he grabbed a pencil behind him and stuck it into my vagina. Seconds later my dad walked in and said it was time for bed. My brother threw himself back and I hovered out of his room. That night was the first time my dad @ CAPS4 read me a bedtime story. A few months later my brother @ PERSON1 started acting weird too. He was always nervous with me and was never relaxed. One day he went out and bought a whole bunch of my favorite candies. These @ CAPS7 "@ CAPS8 @ ORGANIZATION1's." @ CAPS9 looks like an @ ORGANIZATION1 which was white and crisp on the outside and the inside is full of chocolate. He was bribing me with these, saying, "I'll give you a box of @ CAPS8 @ ORGANIZATION1 if you let me touch you in three places of my choosing." I didn't know @ CAPS4 that was wrong. I just wanted the candy, so I let it be. This interaction lasted about a year. He never did anything invasive. After all that happened @ CAPS4 really didn't know what to do with myself. Once I knew it was wrong I cried but it didn't help @ CAPS4. So I tried to laugh and it worked. Knowing that laughter is a key to forgetting things has helped me move on.

            "Laughs" @ CAPS1 have you ever felt it? The feeling of uncontrollable joy that settles in you? Whoever feels that @ CAPS11 never explains in one word except one. To laugh. It's a wonderful feeling, @ CAPS11 makes you do so many things, like screaming and screaming ! Someone once said that laughter is the beauty of life. It helps us out of tough times, and @ CAPS11 always puts a smile on our face when we @ CAPS2 down. It will make the good times even better and will never be forgotten. Laughter is something that everyone needs. It helps us connect with people. It will bring you together with each other. This is my story. The story of how laughter made me meet the love of life @ CAPS7. How the bond of joy between us will last forever, and how the memories of her smile will last in me forever. @ DATE1 was the day I met him. It was a beautiful day, snow covered the ground for miles and I was surrounded by amazing friends from @ CAPS7. The feeling of boredom quickly flew over our heads. So we decided it was time to have some fun with @ CAPS1. We quickly put on our snow clothes and started running for the door. The moment we walked out on everyone's side except me, we pulled over. I kept going through the icy air. I slowly started to realize that they had stopped and tried to stop immediately. They all started to laugh as I lay on my icy ass holding @ CAPS7. I was so embarrassed and so shocked by @ CAPS4 that had just arrived that I didn't move, I just lay down and closed @ CAPS7's eyes. As I was lying there, I started to hear footsteps. I thought they were just @ CAPS7 friends coming to help me. But when I opened @ CAPS7's eyes, they weren't @ CAPS7 friends I saw. It was a hansom man, one that I had seen a few times before in high school @ CAPS7. @ CAPS3 leans in and asks me : "@ CAPS2 are you okay ?" I shyly reply "yes ..." @ CAPS3 smiles and leans in to help me up. As our skin touches each other I get butterflies all over the body from @ CAPS7. I look at it and @ CAPS11 says @ CAPS3 had the same feeling. As I stand at @ CAPS7 feet, we both smile and start to laugh. To this day, I still don't understand why we laughed ... I wonder a million things at once, but the first question that comes out of @ CAPS7's mouth is : "@ CAPS4 is your name ?" @ CAPS3 responds with a smile and says, "@ CAPS6 do you?" "@ CAPS7's name is @ CAPS8." I answer. I start thanking him and asking if @ CAPS3 would like hot chocolate or coffee. @ CAPS3's response is in a cute tone that made @ CAPS7's spine shiver. @ CAPS3 says "I'd rather take you get a burger, will you come?" A huge smile emerges on @ CAPS7's face as I say "yes". @ CAPS3 grabs @ CAPS7's hand and pulls me closer to @ CAPS7's friends. They all started to smile, turn around and quickly walk away into the depths of the @ CAPS7 house. @ CAPS3 smiles and decides not to call. We both start to laugh as we run to his car. I have @ CAPS1 heard a lot about @ CAPS6, @ CAPS7 @ CAPS2 friends always talk about how cute and muscular @ CAPS3 is. The first thought that crossed @ CAPS7's head was, I can't believe @ CAPS3 wants to take me to lunch ! We awkwardly sit in the car until a little dinner party called @ ORGANIZATION1. When we stop, @ CAPS3 jumps out of the car and rushes to the @ CAPS7 door to open it. @ CAPS3 is such a sweet man I thought to myself. When we get to our table, @ CAPS3 orders for both of us and asks me all kinds of questions. @ CAPS3 made me smile the time of the hole ! I don't think any boy has ever done that. After we ate and @ CAPS3 brought me home, we smiled and laughed as @ CAPS3 told me joke after joke. When we reach home @ CAPS7, @ CAPS3 asks me a question. A question I will never forget. "@ CAPS11 kiss you?" @ CAPS3 asks. I don't answer but lean in and kiss her. We make eye contact after each room and start to laugh. Why we laughed, I'll never know. But at that point, I fell in love. At that point, I realized that laughter would be the bond between us forever. Laughter is in memory of him. @ MONTH1 @ CAPS3 rest in peace ...

Like all great things in life, laughter is what keeps me going. Without laughing, I'm exhausted. I'm going to tell you about the three things that make me laugh the most in life. The first is @ CAPS1 mom. (@ LOCATION1) @ CAPS1 mom is the one who showed me that laughter is the key to almost everything. She showed me that it was normal to fall. Laugh that you are stupid, that you were wrong, but make sure you get up. @ CAPS1's mom can make me laugh no matter what happens in @ CAPS1's teenage "drama" life. The biggest thing I've learned is when I'm emotionally broken, when I feel the whole world is against me and I don't want to be me to laugh about it anymore. When my best friend @ CAPS1 and I had a fight @ TIME1 @ DATE1 I haven't been out of @ CAPS1's house for about a week and a half, I didn't want to tell any of my friends about @ CAPS1. @ CAPS1 mom tried to get me to call her but I never did, until one day @ CAPS1 mom sat on @ CAPS1's bed and said "@ CAPS2 doesn't mean it happens to you this is what you do with it, you hear me laughing all the time, when i am upset, sad and happy ... this is what i want you to do no matter what happens in your "drama" teenage life, don't ignore it @ CAPS2 laughs, call her. "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS5's friends are definitely in second place. Like my friends @ CAPS1, I also have @ CAPS5. When I'm with them nothing else puts me in tune, the whole world could end and I wouldn't notice a thing. I feel like since I got @ CAPS5 I speak a different language that most people can't understand except @ CAPS1's friends with @ CAPS5. @ CAPS1's friends are very random and have a lot of energy. One thing they taught me is that @ CAPS5 is a gift and a curse. When @ PERSON1 and I hang out, no matter who we are around, we can't help but feel awkward and laugh all the time. Sometimes that brings us to things like people our age think we are laughing at when we really aren't. Third place is me. I make myself laugh more than anyone or anything. I am a total actor. When I try to be funny I'm not that funny, but when I don't try I make people laugh so much that they cry. @ CAPS1 all my life I've been told "@ CAPS2, wow you really are something no matter what someone's mood makes life so amazing." The folks at @ CAPS11 laughing is one thing but @ CAPS11 laughing myself is very different. When I was sitting on the floor in the @ CAPS1 @ TIME1 room I was thinking about @ CAPS1's past life and I got pretty upset, but to get myself out of the negative thinking I started to think about the good times I was doing. passed and within five minutes I was laughing so hard @ CAPS1 stomach ache. Like I said "like all great things" laughter is @ CAPS1 the biggest. Laughing can really open someone's eyes. I will continue to live with laughter and will eventually pass it on when the time comes.

In any relationship, things like physical contact, verbal conversations, or any other type of outward expression are very important. Most notably, laughter is also the key to any kind of interaction with someone. Laughter says, “What you're saying is funny” or, I like that. ”Laughter says a lot without saying a word. Think of someone you know very well. This could be your best friend, or it could be. be a family member. If you think about it you can tell when they are angry, sad, angry, frustrated just by looking at their facial expressions or looking them in the eye. When you see them laughing you see happiness . It's so obvious, because their eyes sparkle, their faces light up, and you just know they're happy. Now think about when you go out with your friends. Being with friends is always fun, and we love it. That's why we're going to do things with them right ? And when we're with them we laugh a lot. We tell funny stories, we share funny jokes and memories that make us laugh , and we love it, we love the feeling we get when we're with them, and above all, we love the moments that make us laugh. Maybe it's a long drive, a slumber party, or maybe it's to a party or maybe a church . Have you ever noticed that when one person laughs, the rest of the group follows in unison ? Laughter is contagious, so it's hard to resist most of the time. Whether it's a joke that has been told, or someone has made a fool of themselves, it's always a favorite part of any gathering or party, or whatever @ MOIS1 be. Some people say that every time you laugh it adds a few seconds to your life. I'm not sure I believe it, but I think laughing is healthy. I know when I laugh I feel so much better. Every time I come back from hanging out with my three closest friends, I feel great. It's like everything that happened to me that week or that day is just forgotten, and especially if we laugh a lot, it makes me feel good. When a friend or someone else we know is down, what's the first thing most of us resort to ? It'll make them laugh, isn't it? Because laughter is an integral part of happiness. When someone laughs, they find it hard to resist the encouragement. For this reason, I believe that laughter is the best medicine of all. It's so hard not to feel better laughing. Again, I believe that laughter is important in any human relationship, because laughing shows that you enjoy their company, just like smiling at all the good times, or putting on the right face when they tell a story, and showing them that you. are engaged in the conversation. If someone is telling a funny story or a joke, laughing shows you understand the humor of what they are saying. If you like being with this person, laugh a lot. Show them that you enjoy spending time with them. People like to make other people laugh. Whether you are laughing at a joke, a funny story, a face they made, or all of the above, laughing is just as important in any situation. As they say to smile, everyone laughs in the same language. Laughter says the same thing all over the world. Laughter is almost always a good sign and means something is going right.

             The @ CAPS1 of Laughter Laughter can be used in many different ways, you can either laugh because something is funny, be rude, or just because you like what people do and @ CAPS3 makes you smile. Sometimes we shouldn't laugh at other people because @ CAPS3 might hurt them even more than we imagine, and @ CAPS3 might even affect their lives @ CAPS2 as they get older. When I was younger I was faced with a situation that affected me @ CAPS2 I grew up. As far back as I can remember, I have always loved singing, but up to a point, I couldn't bear to sing in front of a crowd or even my family. I was about four years old. @ CAPS3 was a dark @ DATE1 @ TIME1, my family decided we were going out for some fun at a place called @ ORGANIZATION1. This @ ORGANIZATION1 was where family and friends could get together to have a good time, there would be a group playing, round and bright colorful tables to sit on, drinks, and @ CAPS3 had a room of games for children. My cousin and their band were going to play this at @ TIME1. My family and I all dressed up, I was wearing a beautiful white dress that my mother had chosen for me. I looked like a star in my own eyes and I was satisfied. When we arrived, my family and I sat at a bright, lime-green, glowing-in-the-dark round table and watched the show. I danced with my parents for a long time, then I played games with my brother and my friends. My cousin who is the singer of the band would call into the mic if anyone wanted to sing a @ CAPS1 to the crowd. I ran to my parents and told them this was my chance to shine and that I wanted to do @ CAPS3. They smiled at me and said "yes honey, of course you can do @ CAPS3!" @ CAPS2 I ran to where my cousin was standing, pushed through the bundle of children so I could be in the front. I looked up smiling and raised my hand to my cousin, shouting for her to choose me. My cousin smiled at me and picked me up and put me on the speaker ! I was so thrilled that I couldn't even breathe. @ CAPS3 was my biggest dream to stand here with a microphone in my hand. @ CAPS2 I stood on the big enclosure, looked at the crowd and took a deep breath and started to sing. I was singing my favorite @ CAPS1 that I knew from memory. The crowd smiled and applauded, but @ CAPS2 soon @ CAPS2 I sang the chorus from @ CAPS1 everyone started laughing. I didn't know why they were laughing. Was it @ CAPS3 because I accidentally forgot to take my chewing gum out of my mouth ? Because I forgot. Or was @ CAPS3 because I sounded so bad ? I was so scared, the gum I was chewing in my mouth started to harden and my voice weakened. I started to panic, my eyes started to get wet. I noticed that tears were streaming down my face. I couldn't even bear to be in front of all these people if they were going to laugh at me. So I jumped off the speaker, ran to my mom, and started crying in her lap. I cried for a long hour, my family tried to tell me everything was fine and I had done a wonderful job, but @ CAPS3 was not enough for me to believe @ CAPS3. Over the years, I've always hated singing in front of people. @ CAPS3 scared me thinking maybe someone would laugh out loud because I was wrong or wrong. After that I always started telling myself that I have a horrible voice and I knew @ CAPS3 was the reason the crowd at @ ORGANIZATION1 was laughing at me. Every time my parents asked me to sing a @ CAPS1, I would tell them "no thanks, I don't like singing anymore". @ CAPS3 was not true at all, I lied about @ CAPS3 to my own parents, but I still had this horrible feeling in my heart and soul. Now that I'm older, I understand why I was so terrified, and the reason people laughed was not at all what I thought @ CAPS3 was. My parents told me that @ CAPS3 was because people thought I was adorable, and since I was young I couldn't really pronounce certain words correctly. I laughed at @ CAPS3, and now I keep telling myself that I can sing because nothing else is going to bring me down, and I try to stay positive about @ CAPS3. @ CAPS3 is always very difficult for me to sing solo, but after a while I will have the strength and courage to sing to anyone.

 I'm going to tell you a story about when I was a young boy and how I used to take long trips with my dad because he was a long haul truck driver. My dad and I have been to many places around @ LOCATION2 all of which were great fun and amazing. And we all laughed a lot. The one I liked the most was when we went to @ LOCATION1 this place was so amazing there is so much to do as well as so much to visit. Things you could just see like @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 which was pretty cool I thought and all the landmarks. My dad told me to go see if I could go through security at @ ORGANIZATION1 and I was like no I'm good you can though and I laughed at him; @ CAPS1 place i really liked and went to should be @ LOCATION3, even though it was very hot and muggy it was still fun. I remember my dad telling us that we had a lot of extra time and that he was going to take us to the zoo. , and penguins. It was one of the best trips my dad ever took to me, I really enjoyed it. One of the funniest memories I can remember is when we were driving in the desert and there was this paper in the air and I didn't know what it was so I was like, " daddy, what is it? and he said "it's a shooting star" I was like "in the middle of the day"? and it took me about a few years to figure out what it really was, but now I know what it was and I look back on that day and laugh.

 There was a memory of mine that was full of laughter and fun. Then it also turned into a serious, no-joke madder. It all started a @ DATE1 @ TIME1, my brother @ ORGANIZATION1 called me and told me to come over. I hadn't been to my mom for a while. I said yes, of course the man will be dead in an hour. I hopped in my truck and headed for my mom's house. Along the way, I stopped to refuel at the gas station. Fifteen minutes later, I arrived at my mother's house. when I got there, my brother was waiting for me outside. @ ORGANIZATION1 approached the truck and helped me with my bag and the door. Once inside the house, I walked over to the kitchen, saw my @ CAPS1, gave her a hug, and asked her how she was. She replied, I'm fine honey, then asked me what was new, with myself ? I didn't say much @ CAPS1, hanging around trying to avoid trouble. I asked her if she needed me to do something? Or should be done? My om named a few things that needed to be done around the house. After she finished telling me some of the things, I walked over to my bedroom to change into my work clothes, then left. I caught my brother on the way because he was going to help me. While we were in the garage @ ORGANIZATION1 brings up the fact that I haven't been in a while, he said party tonight. I said okay. While I was done working on the garage, my dad came down and said the fence needed fixing, so we moved the tractor and fixed the fence. It was @ NUM1 at night already, people were already showing up. When we got home my @ CAPS1 comes out and says, what are you doing here ? Enter the party already, it's a full house there were @ NUM2 people in my mother's house that evening. Drink and just have a good time. When I walked over to the living room I noticed the girls cooking for the guys while the guys playing drinking games. There were a few games going on, for example there was beer pong, shots and beer bang. There was always someone who wanted to break the drinking record in the house, to be the best drinker. The drinking record in the house for a night of drinking was @ NUM3 shots and @ NUM4 beers. To this day the record still stands and the person holding the record is me. I'm looking at the pictures and a friend of my @ CAPS1 told me I wanted to challenge you. I said okay. It didn't end well @ NUM5 shots, and the guy who was against me passed out on the table. Hours later, everyone was asleep except me, my brother and a friend of ours. We were outside chewing while @ ORGANIZATION1 peed on his dad's car. All of a sudden I look and @ ORGANIZATION1 is throwing up all over the floor. I laughed so hard I felt more because of the expression on his face smiling when he was throwing up. My friend @ PERSON1 and I walked down the stairs from @ ORGANIZATION1 to his bed, put him to sleep, and walked up the stairs to lie down. Before us when the door opened and it's @ ORGANIZATION1 he meant he loves us and good night. We have responded thank you brother even to you. Less than thirty seconds later we heard some shit and a loud noise falling down the stairs, it was @ ORGANIZATION1. The next @ TIME1 I woke up and wasn't feeling so good I told my @ CAPS1 about it. She said okay, I'll cook you some food. So she did, I didn't feel any better so I just went home to sleep. I opened my door, saw my @ CAPS1 at home and said, @ TIME1 @ CAPS1. Did she say you were drinking? I said yes, and I don't feel so good. she said okay, I'll take you to the doctor if it doesn't get better. A month went by without me eating properly or not drinking so I went to the doctor and they told me I messed up my liver so much I had the liver of a @ NUM6 year old, all i remember was crying and telling my @ CAPS1 never again. I realized that drinking and having fun is fine until someone gets hurt. The doctor told me if I had to drink again I could die, I made the best choice of my life there I believe. To date I haven't had any alcohol at all, it's been a year and @ NUM7 days. Laughing and having a good time is good, but there is always something wrong, @ CAPS2 underage drinking is now out loud at my mom's house.

@ NUM1) I heard a true story about a normal businessman @ CAPS1. he was not so high in his business. @ CAPS2 he always says hello to everyone with his big laugh. One day the boss of the company came into his company and asked everyone who worked the hardest? "@ CAPS2 no one answered that question. Then the boss said" or recommend someone to promotion level, "then everyone recommended this businessman. Because he always said hello to everyone with a big laugh. and when I was with my friends, laughter made us friendlier. Laughing is also good for your health. If you laugh a lot your life becomes much longer than before. Of course, it is also good for the spirit. He is not a very good worker. He just made it back. everyone happier with their laughter. That's why it could be the highest level in the business. I think laughter is really good for everything. And I also laugh a lot. I want people to be happier . "

 Laugh @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 someone who laughs a lot or a little? If @ CAPS4 @ CAPS3 the kind of person who can laugh about anything and everything then I'm sure we would get along. Laughter plays a key role in my life. @ CAPS1 is in about three different ways, in that I joke a lot about a lot of things, do fun things like make faces, and lastly I also laugh at being a klutz. When @ CAPS4 sees or talks to me for a short time or for a long time, I guarantee that I can and will make @ CAPS4 laugh. Laughter can be an amazing thing, in any type of situation, such as a sticky, embarrassing situation, or just any type of situation where @ CAPS4 doesn't know what @ CAPS4 should be doing ; Just remember @ CAPS4 can laugh around this time. Since I was just a young girl, no matter where or what I did, I always seemed to be a huge klutz. My mom would always say, "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS3 worse than a bull in a store @ LOCATION1." @ CAPS5 was so right. If @ CAPS1 were as easy as dropping things, maybe even breaking glass or falling ; this statement has always been true. All @ CAPS5 could do when I did something like that was just laugh, because @ CAPS5 knew @ CAPS5 has a clumsy daughter. Like that time when I was in elementary school, we had award meetings every month, these were to reward students who had done well that month and who followed the rules of a certain characteristic. It was the day I had hoped for; my name to be called. When the teachers were on stage shouting names, I expected @ CAPS1 to be my turn. Then my name was called. I stood up and was so excited and nervous to go in front of the crowd and receive my award. When I got up there I got my prize and then I went back down the stairs. Not a good idea when I was so excited. When I was going down, I was literally going down the stairs. My feet had missed a step and I flew onto my behind. Now tell me what @ CAPS4 would do in this situation ? In front of more than two hundred children and thirty parents? Well I just had to laugh @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, get up and go back to my seat. Another thing about the @ CAPS1 laughter really makes me who I am to this day. I don't know where or what I would do if @ CAPS1 wasn't a lack of dexterity for me when I was younger. Laughter brought me closer to my family and friends. They know when I look gloomy; that if they want me not to be so gloomy they'll have to make me laugh. My closest friends and I joke and laugh a lot. Sometimes @ CAPS1 can be facetious, so we need to catch up on these. From my experience of being goofy in any situation, I've learned that instead of being embarrassed and not wanting to bring up what happened ever again, what to make @ CAPS1 funny and something that @ CAPS4 can laugh about is much better. Learning from a young age to laugh and have fun, @ CAPS1 has really made me a better person ; in that people know me for a lot of different things, but one of them is that I'm a happy, funny girl and laugh a lot. It's something I'm proud of, just knowing that I can make my peers and other adults laugh and have a good time. Therefore, laughter is not just an element or part of my life, @ CAPS1 plays a huge role.

 It was my first year of @ CAPS1. high school and I felt pretty confident. I had great teachers and all the classes I wanted. My first day went well! I woke up on time, had a good breakfast, and hadn't even missed the school bus. My first lessons were fabulous and I was about to go to lunch. As the bell rang, I rushed to the cafeteria to get a good seat in the line. A close friend of mine had called me by name so I turned to wave and when I turned around I ran straight to @ LOCATION1. We hit hard. I flew back, dropping everything I was carrying. I tried to say I was sorry but all she did was look at me and walk away. As I picked up my books, I realized I didn't want anything to do with this girl and decided to forget what had just happened. After lunch I had @ CAPS2. I was very excited for this class because my dream boy, @ PERSON1, was there. Along the way, I made a quick washroom stop to make sure I still looked decent, then walked over to the classroom. Upon entering the room the first thing I saw was @ PERSON1's beautiful blonde hair and dazzling blue eye. Then I recorded the whole scene. Guess who was twirling their hair and fluttering their eyelashes on the guy of my dreams ! You got it, @ LOCATION1. From that moment it was war! Throughout the year, @ LOCATION1 and I have constantly strived to surpass ourselves. We were rushing to class to see who could sit behind @ PERSON1. She always had to have the best hair. I would get a cute new haircut and she would get high lights. I received a phone. So she went out and bought the latest and greatest phone with the built-in music player. I remember coming to class early one day so excited to show @ PERSON1 this new game I had learned. But of course when I walked into the room @ LOCATION1 was already showing him the exact same set. There was one thing I always had on @ LOCATION1, the books. @ PERSON1 and I loved the books. We would sit and talk about the latest and greatest books for hours. This has always made @ LOCATION1 jealous. Our behavior as a child lasted like this for three or four months. One day at lunch I was just sitting down, eating my food and minding my own business. Suddenly @ LOCATION1 appeared out of nowhere and spat soda in my face. It did. It was the last straw. I grabbed my carton of milk and threw it over his head. The cafeteria was silent for about a minute. @ LOCATION1 and I stood there staring at each other, rage coming out of our eyes until someone broke the silence with a big laugh. Soon everyone was laughing, including @ LOCATION1 and me. We realized how stupid we had acted and for the first time we were laughing together, not at each other. We both apologized and helped each other clean up. In the end, we became very good friends. To this day, we still laugh at the @ NUM1 rank rivalry.

All the great memories @ LOCATION2 and I had and shared together when we were really good best friends. We were about @ NUM1 years old and from @ NUM2 to @ NUM3 grade. Sure, we've grown older over the years, but we've had so many great times together. Whenever we hung out together, we would always laugh about almost everything, and most of the time, we just never let a lot of stupid things get to us. Whenever I needed to talk to someone, it was her. She lived a life that was almost the same as the one I lived in life, and so she knows what I or even she has to do or say. Even though we still had a lot of fun, we would have our moments and fight, but we would always make things right. We would always see each other for everything. Guess what I'm trying to say is that two close people always have their great needs and feelings, and especially their laughter in the relationship. Here are a few laughs @ LOCATION2 and I shared and spent together. I remember that in class @ NUM2 we always tried to hang out whenever we could. We were still young so it was hard to do anything because our parents wouldn't let us most of the time. Every time we did, we would think about random games and go to different places just to have fun. As we got older we were trusted more and we could do a lot more things, which was a good thing. Then I moved to @ LOCATION1, not the best thing, but it was out of love. What made her better is that she still came all the time. We would pick her up on @ DATE1, then @ DATE2, my mom would drive to school because my mom would always go to work there in Florence. Every night she was there, we were still up. I remember I always kept these little packets of hot chocolate in my room and after my parents went to bed we would sneak out to get some hot water so that we had hot chocolate to drink. Other times we would brew coffee so we could stand longer. It was sometimes difficult because my room was directly opposite my parents' room and at the time I had beads hanging on my door. Fun times trying to shut up and not get caught. Sometimes when she came, she would bring all of her makeup and everything so that we could get dressed. One night we were blindfolded and we were putting make-up on each other.

Laughter is something everyone experiences. It changes situations from bad to funny. It's like magic. I mean you don't need a wand or anything, just a twisted sense of humor. You just need a little common sense and a little illogical thinking. I know these are two totally different things, but isn't that what makes us @ CAPS4? Isn't laughing just the answer to hearing something illogical that is different from your common sense? No it is not. Laughter is also an extremely useful tool. you can do a lot of things with laughter. you can get away with it, get in trouble, start a friendship, end a friendship, find a job, lose a job, win a game, and lose a game. and that's not all, notice. But I'm not here to talk about all of these things, just one of them. make friends by laughing. sit down and listen and maybe you will learn something. Before I start the story, let me start by saying that I'm not exactly the nicest guy on the planet, and I know that, but people @ CAPS4. It's not even on purpose half the time. the majority of my jokes and humor is about depressing things. I honestly think I'm getting this response from people because they don't know how to react otherwise. And that's why @ CAPS1 or @ CAPS2 or whoever invented sadists and masochists. Anyway, let's get back on track. Once upon a time when teenagers were oblivious to the harsh reality of modern life, there was a child. that child's name was @ PERSON1. now i really haven't known @ PERSON1 for a very long time and to be completely honest I didn't really want to, but he accompanied me and Grant and @ PERSON3 at the time. he always wore those awesome Iron Maiden t-shirts and listened to the kind of music I loved so I guess you could say it was inevitable but it's neither here nor there. One day we started to talk. We both thought about that big barrel that had been left in the way of our school. it was empty and plastic and when you are @ NUM1 everything big, red and plastic looks fun. we decided to take the cannon and stand on it. Yes, that was all we wanted to do with it. It never really crossed our minds that we could have taken it or built something with it. no, the only fair conclusion we could come to was to hold on to it. and we did. and it was fun. the next day we came to school and @ PERSON1 was handing out invitations to her birthday party. I was pretty excited so I went. it turns out that our lives are very similar. I think the first thing I noticed when I went to his place was the kitchen. it was like they took my kitchen and painted it a different color and then put it there. Honestly, I thought I was the only kid who lived like I did. I used to get mad because my mom never bought matching dishes or silverware because we never really had the money and this kid had the most random assortment of dishes and the like in his home. collectible versions of different pint glasses, mismatched silverware, logical dish placement. I know it sounds silly but it made me happy. When the other guys arrived we started talking, or at least I did. we also talked about random things like the @ CAPS3 videos and the good movies we had seen recently. @ PERSON1 and I always ended up talking about other things like travel, the future, and dogs, but that's just because we agreed the new movies were kind of rubbish, too many explosions and not enough character development. finally, we lit a fire and moved our conversations outside. see, it always seems like things are better when you look into the fire. and when the fire goes out you want that feeling again. Well I was ready to fix it, but everyone came in except me and @ PERSON2 (another guy at the party) so we decided to play around for a bit. we went to the garage @ PERSON1 and found his @ NUM2 and some brake fluid. we sprayed it on the fire and I think my face got a little sunburned after that. The flames had come so close to my face that I could feel my eyelashes burning at the tips. Then we grabbed some more wood and dropped it on the fire. everyone came back outside to play with it. I know I'm kind of a bad influence, but when life gives you the opportunity to do something fun, you can't let it go. We spent the rest of the night talking about girls and making jokes. I just wish we had a @ CAPS4- @ CAPS5- @ CAPS6. That night I made lifelong friends.

 Laughter, one of the greatest gifts in life. It's what gets you through the day, the year, and in the long run, your life. For me, a lot of things can go wrong in a day. For example, I might miss an assignment that ends up being a big part of my grade or just have a rough day. All I need to make these bad things look like old memories is to have a long, pleasant laugh. It's ten times better if that laugh is shared with someone else. That's why when I moved to @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS1, I tried to keep an eye out for kids like me, who liked to laugh and make others laugh. The first few days were difficult. I met a lot of new people who were all the same. Some just wanted to know my name and some wanted to know me better, and that was good. I noticed that one person was in several of my classes. So one day our teacher @ CAPS2 asked us to partner up and write a creation myth or how something came to be what it is. Quickly I looked around for someone before everyone else had a partner and I would be sitting there awkwardly without a partner. I asked a boy who was in a few other of my classes. I hadn't really noticed or even heard of it. He agreed to be my partner. We introduced ourselves and he told me his name was @ PERSON1. He had a very calm voice. I barely understood his name, so I must have read it in his journal. We had to work on the paper together, but it was more like doing it individually. I started by throwing out a few ideas. @ PERSON1 would then say something and laugh but I could never hear what he would say. We worked on paper for a few days, continuing to exchange only a few words. During this time, I was still trying to make at least one good friend. I thought that maybe threw this friend out, I could meet some of his friends and in time I would have my own group of friends. In the meantime, I had lunch with my sister @ PERSON2. You would think it would be slightly awkward or uncomfortable. It wasn't, it was actually pretty cool because our bond had grown stronger. It would work well for both of us until we made some friends. After a while, she had made some friends and was ready to move on. So one day when we were both having lunch, one of her new friends came by and asked her to go sit with her. I was hoping so much that she would just say no or even, maybe tomorrow, but no. There I was setting all alone in a dining room full of eyes that just judged who you were setting with, if anyone. I started eating my lunch faster than you could say sternocleidomastoid, and I was out of it. Panicked inside but completely calm outside, I paced the hallways looking for someone to hang out with. Then I saw "That @ CAPS3" in three of my classes. I casually approached him and tried to strike up a conversation. For some reason, I felt relaxed not like I was trying to make a new friend but like I was already talking to one. At the beginning, we were just two guys talking about the lessons and the difference between this school and the previous one. Then all of a sudden we started talking about movies, especially the funniest ones. We couldn't stop laughing in all of our classes, especially in auto mechanics. We were using all of our store time trying to remember all the funny lines from the movies and trying to say or play them the best we could. Soon we also found out that we were watching many of the same TV shows. We could make each other laugh with just about anything any of us said. I had noticed this particular quality in @ PERSON1 which made him extremely funny. I wasn't sure what it was, but with everything he said, I was laughing uncontrollably. We laughed at mates, but we quickly became great friends. We really bonded between the laughs. During this time, we were discovering new things about each other. It made us realize that we are very similar. It's been a few months and we've only become great friends. I had already made friends by making them laugh or laughing at their jokes. I knew it was different. I had made the best friend I have ever had. Now I'm moving and it's the worst. I know that with the bond of sharing some of the greatest laughs of my life, we will continue to be friends for a long time.

I have lived in @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 most of my life, I went to pre @ CAPS5 up to grade @ NUM1. @ CAPS7 was about halfway through my @ DATE1 when my mom told me the new "@ CAPS3". Honey we're moving, I froze in shock, didn't know what to think, no we can't move. why she said, uh maybe because I'm going to @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5. I don't want to go somewhere where I have no idea who anyone is. Don't worry, my mom said you'd make some friends. Where are we going anyway I asked? Lebanon she answered me in a soft voice @ CAPS1. @ CAPS6, guess it's not that far from here. There you go, she said @ CAPS7 won't be that bad once we get there and everything is set up and unboxed. Yeah @ CAPS13 I still don't know anyone there, @ CAPS6 your cousin @ PERSON2 is going and he's a junior so he could maybe take you to @ CAPS5 every day if you want and introduce yourself to people. Ok, I said I was excited @ CAPS13, didn't want to walk away from @ CAPS8. We started packing our things, @ CAPS7 took us about a week to get everything out of the old house into the new one. Once the house was full and our things were out, we started cleaning up. We cleaned from top to bottom, head to toe, which took us about two days. So in total, @ CAPS7 took us about a week and two days to pack everything, move and clean up. We said goodbye @ CAPS11 to our friends and family and where on our way. It's not like we'll never see them again, I tell my brothers. We finally pulled up to the house, @ CAPS8 was so excited to see what @ CAPS7 looked like. My mom opened the doors and is going to check out @ CAPS7, she said, wow this place is amazing, we love @ CAPS7, the boys said. I told you you would like @ CAPS7. We looked up and chose our rooms. there were only four bedrooms, so the two younger boys had to share. When we were done with that, we started unpacking our things. I was so tired of doing everything after unpacking my room, I went myself down on my bed When I woke up I realized that I hadn't unpacked everything the way I thought I would, so I was done with that. @ CAPS5 started in about a week, I was so excited @ CAPS13 nervous @ TIME1 at the same time to see what @ CAPS7 would look like. Finally the day was here, honey, wake-up time for @ CAPS5, mum already said @ CAPS13 ... oh forget @ CAPS7, I said I had my groin at @ CAPS5 no matter what. I get out of bed, brush my teeth, do my hair, put on makeup and get dressed. "@ CAPS9" "@ CAPS9" @ PERSON2 is time to go. I rush over to grab my backpack and get in the car. @ CAPS11 morning he said @ CAPS11 morning you are excited for @ CAPS5 he asked yeah just a little nervous. Don't be i will introduce you my gf he is a cool man too k ring @ CAPS11 i said. We're going into the @ CAPS5 wow that's a lot of kids, I said yes there's @ NUM2 freshman this year. We get out of the car and go inside. Let's show you your lessons okay, I said. This is your first period @ PERSON1 she teaches @ CAPS12 arts. He shows me the rest of the six and sends me to class. I walk into @ CAPS8 staring at @ TIME1, my stomach turning into notes wanting to drop out of my stomach. Welcome @ LOCATION1 sit down, I'll be with you shortly, said the teacher. She shows me where to sit and introduces me to the class. Finally the course is over, @ CAPS13 I still have to go to six more. This day feels like it's gone forever, I walk over to the rest of my classes wondering if they won't be so scary @ CAPS13 no I was wrong. Most teachers made me show up in front of class @ CAPS7 was terrifying! I'm getting on the bus, can't wait to have @ CAPS2. I walk pushing the doors, how was your day, did you make any friends, mom calm down, i said sorry, i just wanna know. My day was @ CAPS11, can I go take a shower now ? Yeah, don't take long k. I go out and go lie down on my bed its time to go to sleep I thought @ CAPS13 no my brothers had to come rush me and tell me about this day. @ CAPS7 was about @ TIME1 okay, thought it was time to go to bed. "@ CAPS14" "@ CAPS15" it's time to get up @ LOCATION1, oh no not yet !.

  When we all get together on my dad's side, we all sit down, laugh and talk loudly. I'm saying anyway we're one big fake family @ CAPS1. All the aunts, uncles and cousins come around the small table in the kitchen of my grandmother and discuss. There are so many conversations going on and people talking loudly and laughing, that to me it makes me feel like I'm home away from home. This was the case when some of us gathered for a late birthday party for me, when I was at @ LOCATION1 @ DATE2. It was @ DATE1, my grandmother, my uncle, my aunt, my father, my two cousins and me; were sitting around the kitchen table eating cakes and talking. We were talking about a problem I had. Some how my dad decided to pretend we were in court. My aunt told @ PERSON2 to go get a wig for the judge, who was my uncle. @ PERSON2 brought this blonde wig back and she puts it on my dad's head, he looked so funny. Aunt @ PERSON3 was repairing the front of the wig. I grab his phone and start taking a bunch of pictures of him with the wig on. I send one to my mom saying, "@ CAPS2 mum daddy is pretty." We were all laughing so hard. Then my grandmother decides to put on the wig. Grandma kept saying that it was itching and tickling her. After removing the wig, she began to tell us a story about when my grandpa rammed it into the left side of her rump with a compass. She first set up the story for us, telling us who the teacher was. It was a funny name @ DATE2 that I can't remember. Uncle @ CAPS3 was making an impression of what he thought the teacher would be. His impression was like the former bank owner on @ PERSON1. We all started to laugh very loudly. When my grandmother finally got to the main part of the story, he was so mad at her, because she wrote her name down for speaking in class and he loved her too. So he took a compass and stuffed her rump. For some reason my dad and uncle thought it was so funny they made her say it over and over again. She couldn't say rump without laughing. We all started laughing really hard because she couldn't say rump. Grandma was laughing so hard that she fell in her chair and I thought she was going to die laughing. The laughter got so bad that we started to cry from laughing so much. As you can see my dad side really loves to laugh and be funny. We are one big fake family @ CAPS1. I believe that laughter is a very important part in any relationship you have with someone you meet. One of my favorite things to do is laugh, and I will most likely laugh at anything anyone says. When my dad and his younger brother get together, get ready to laugh really, really hard.

 Do you remember the first day of the @ NUM1 class ? Everyone stands there, awkwardly and enthusiastically, waiting for their seats to be arranged. You have college tremors and it all happens too fast, I remember all of that. I went to school at @ CAPS1 for my college years, my teacher was @ PERSON3. She was the kind of teacher who was strict about where you sat in class. If you didn't like someone, she would probably make you sit next to them thinking that you would magically become friends. I was standing there in the corner with my best friend @ CAPS2, of course we were hoping we were sitting next to each other. After we finally got our seats, we weren't seated together. I was sitting next to @ PERSON4 - a girl I didn't know at all - @ PERSON5, @ PERSON1 and @ PERSON2. I was friends with everyone except @ PERSON4, who I had never seen in my life. As the lessons progressed @ PERSON6 talked about college and the importance of getting good grades and being prepared for high school, we all sat there and dreamed of what it looked like. No one really spoke to anyone, there was always that awkward first day thing going on. @ PERSON4 looked like a girl who would rip your head off if you said something to her, so I kept my mouth shut. @ PERSON6 continued with her "first day lecture" and all of a sudden she was making a joke in the middle of her speech, to get our attention. We all started to laugh. I have to say it was a really good icebreaker. After everyone laughed for a while, it seemed like everyone had relaxed a bit. @ PERSON4 and I started talking about how this joke was only funny because it was so stupid. From that point on we kept talking and she seemed like a cool person. @ PERSON4 and I have become partners for every project we have done and we have always been together, she became my best friend after @ NUM2 days ; all because of the laughter. I have to say the reason @ PERSON4 and I became friends is because of the laughter. I probably would never have spoken to him in the first place; although I'm glad I did because now I have a great best friend! College can be scary, especially on the first day of school. This is why I think laughter is such an important part in someone's relationship, you can't live without it !

I once got sick and told my mom "I have to have some iced tea" so I get up and go to the freezer. Suddenly my throat gets sore and I feel the urge to cough, so I do and instead of coughing on the side, I do it straight into the ice bucket. And my mom happened to be standing next to me, and she was like "@ CAPS1 my God! Son what the hell was that?" so we started to laugh. It was ironic because the germs would be kept in the cooler. It was funny, I kept my germs alive and my mom used this ice cream.

It was cold @ DATE1 @ TIME1 when I decided to go to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 with my friends @ CAPS3, @ CAPS4, @ PERSON1, @ CAPS5 and @ CAPS6. We did a round trip to @ LOCATION1 and so we rode with @ CAPS4's dad, along the way we listened to A @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 and @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11 (which I recommend to all @ CAPS12 fans) when we got there i told a joke and we all laughed so hard they all pooped and died.

 I always wanted to be able to go back in time and relive the childhood of @ CAPS7. Knowing that this was the time I was happiest and the time I was living my life aimlessly, without plans. Watching the little cousins or brothers @ CAPS7 I see the joy, laughter and silliness. I see innocent and gentle faces that have no idea or understanding of what is going on around them. As I watch them slowly come out of their unusual ways, I find myself at @ CAPS4 in the year @ DATE1. A little girl, not yet in school, runs in her grandmother's yard at midday of an @ DATE4. She swings her pigtails back and forth while hiding her hands in her waist pants @ NUM1, one eye closed and the other slightly open as she watches her older sister run around looking for a place @ CAPS4 to to hide. "@ CAPS1, nine, eight, seven ..." "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 !" @ CAPS7 sister, @ PERSON1, yells at me @ CAPS4 behind one of the giant oak trees. I laugh a little @ CAPS4 myself and start at @ CAPS8. "@ CAPS8, four ... three ... two ..." I slowed down considerably, "ONE!" and like a rocket, I blew up the porch with @ CAPS7 arms outstretched on either side, making engine noises, and pretended to be a pilot "@ CAPS9 on lock! Mayday, mayday! CRASH ! ". I tackle the ground @ CAPS7 sister @ CAPS4. I remember the look on our mothers' faces as we lay there rolling around in the grass laughing. I closed my eyes @ CAPS7 and reopened them @ CAPS4 found myself in @ DATE2. It was a few days after the tragic event of @ NUM2. Everyone gathered at Grandma's as always, the children in one room and the adults in the other. I was playing in our small ball pool with the two younger cousins, @ PERSON2 and @ ORGANIZATION1, when we noticed there was a small hole in the wall. "@ CAPS6, look through." @ PERSON2 asked. I took a deep breath and did as he asked. "@ CAPS11 !" I shouted The Little Hole gave us a vision of what was going on in the next room @ CAPS4 which had all the parents and the elderly with straight looks and serious tones. I let the little ones take a look, they didn't find it as interesting as I did but they didn't give me another chance @ CAPS4 to see. I pushed @ CAPS7 through. The three of us are looking at something so small. We continued to laugh and talk. We did this for about @ CAPS1 minutes, not knowing that our uncle was watching us for at least @ CAPS8 minutes. He motioned to the other adults @ CAPS4 to see what we were doing. One by one, noticing that the number of people in the next room was decreasing. Soon there were none in sight. "@ CAPS12 are they all gone ?" We panicked. Light laughter unfolded behind us. @ PERSON2 looked to @ ORGANIZATION1, @ ORGANIZATION1 looked at me, I looked @ CAPS4 @ PERSON2 and at the same time we turned around and saw everyone smiling and laughing and taking pictures of each other. We stood still with red faces and quickly started pointing the finger that gave us the crazy idea of spying. After that, it was like any family day; everyone in the living room, food in the kitchen, warm hugs and kisses from grandma, people pinching @ CAPS2's cheeks, big smiles and long, loud laughs. I see friends shaking hands and children screaming and screaming, people saying they are loved ones "I love you". I'm looking @ CAPS7 feet and in the blink of an eye I'm back @ CAPS4 @ DATE3. I lift @ CAPS7 my head over @ CAPS7's shoulders, I see I'm in my grandma's living room babysitting. I'm sixteen this year and I don't think there is a day that I don't laugh. Of course I can't laugh when it comes to really serious @ CAPS4, but other than that laughing is part of humor / youth. When someone tells a joke and you think it was funny, you don't just say it was funny without laughing. Everyone knows that from time to time @ CAPS4 takes a step back and laughs. I always wanted to be able to go back in time and relive the childhood of @ CAPS7. Knowing that this was the time I was happiest and the time I was living my life aimlessly, without plans. I didn't want @ CAPS4 to impress anyone. I lived well @ CAPS7's childhood and when I think about it, I sit down, look at everything I've done and laugh.

 Laughter can be helpful in many ways and in many ways. For example, if you are having a bad day, a friend may try to make you laugh to help you feel better. Or maybe something like you've lost a loved one. Yes, it is a very tragic thing, especially if you are really close to this family member. People will always try to make you laugh and tell you that there is a better place and they won't hurt anymore. I've been through times like this and sometimes felt better after the person (s) made me laugh. I also know that I have people who take care of me and want me to be happy and full of laughs. The last time I needed someone to help me laugh was yesterday. It was last night, I had math homework that I also had to do. It frustrated me so much, I started to cry too much. I told my boyfriend and he just started telling all these silly jokes. They kind of helped. What helped him the most was when he said he could come this @ DATE1. I started to smile and laugh because I was so happy that he could. Another time laughing helped me was when I was at @ CAPS1 with my mom, dad, brother and little sister about @ NUM1 years ago. My brother decided he wanted to take me to @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 as well. I don't remember if this was the ride though. Anyway, he took me in there to @ NUM2 or @ NUM3. I was so scared and wet that I didn't speak to her for the rest of the day. He finally apologized and also took me as a makeup artist to one of the stores. I chose what I wanted on my face, I can't quite remember what it was, I think it was some kind of fish. But, after she was done, I looked at myself in the mirror she had and burst out laughing. I laughed for about ten minutes and said I accepted his apology. When we got home a few days later, I took the hose and sprayed it just to get it back. And also be a stinky little sister, like all little sisters should be every now and then in my opinion. Thank god it was during @ DATE2 because he and me did it a few more times just to be kids too mom and dad. Finally, I remember this time in @ NUM4 when my best friend @ CAPS4 was moving. I cried for days and days. Then finally he called me and we talked for about @ NUM5 hours, and talking about him also made me laugh and wish he hadn't budged. At least I still talked too much with him. Only about once or twice though. Anyway, those moments of talking about him too made me so happy. We talked about his dogs. One of her dog names is @ CAPS5, she was about @ NUM6 months old at the time. She started chasing his cock and when she circled around @ NUM6 times she tripped over her feet and fell on her rump. So, to end this trip down memory lane. These three blasts from the past were the ones that made me laugh, too, helped me feel better when I was feeling upset or depressed.

  Laughter in life is a good thing to have I believe. Once @ CAPS3, I was @ NUM1 years old, I had one and @ CAPS1. We have always loved going out and doing things together like taking a walk, going to the beach, or going to the parks. What was so funny was that we also liked to eat together, maybe not in his dog bowl, but on plates or on a picnic table. He was a cute dog. He had four little puppies named @ CAPS5- @ CAPS6, popcorn, big tail and mountain. I named them all with weird animal names because it's either their smell or what they looked or liked to do. The reason we named my dog @ CAPS1 was because he always smelled like @ CAPS1. I always took him for walks to make him a healthy dog. This made me very angry @ CAPS3 he had puppies and a companion. I don't know why maybe just because I really loved my dog and wanted him to be mine alone. My favorite friend. I thought in my head hey! he's my dog and you leave him alone and don't touch him. Well @ CAPS3 he had puppies I finally realized in my head that @ CAPS1 just also wanted to live his own life, a family and be a big dog. He didn't hate me, he loved me and giving him a family is what I allowed him and that made him happy. What was funny about the little puppies was that they smelled like weird food, like @ CAPS1, @ CAPS5 chops or popcorn. My favorite puppy was @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 because that's what he smelled like, not @ CAPS1 but @ CAPS5. POPCORN was a good dog too, as were the other dogs, but @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6 was a biting. It's funny because these little puppies love to bite and chew stuff. The second you leave my puppies alone, they are going to eat everything. Once @ CAPS3 we went on a trip to another state, he had to leave the puppies alone with a babysitter, and @ CAPS3 we came back, they ate a lot of clothes and destroyed everything. I also had @ CAPS11 but they weren't good animals or pets so they would eat everything too, and they stink. No, not like @ CAPS1 or popcorn but something else disgusting. Puppies loved to nibble on your toes and hair. They had little teeth but oh they hurt. Stinky breath that these dogs had I don't know why but now it stinks. One of my favorite stories about @ CAPS1 was that he never liked swimming. It was strange to me because you would have thought that cats hate water more than dogs. Well @ CAPS1 couldn't swim so I had to teach him myself how to be a good owner and everything. Well @ CAPS3 he never paddled doggy style he put his head under the water and swam forward. I don't know why, but I always thought he could breathe like this? or is it just a dog thing. Well I ended up getting over that, I don't think it was good for him to swim underwater. Like cats he never liked water, it was just a phobia of my dog I guess. But I did my best to get him to recover. @ CAPS3 I moved to states where I had to leave it was the saddest thing in my life. But we are all moving on the right. I think laughter is so good to have in your life because it can help you become more anti-depressive and not have to focus on the bad things in life. Every now and then @ CAPS3 I'm sad to think of @ CAPS1. I had other animals like @ CAPS10, @ CAPS11, @ CAPS12 and cats. Personally, I like cats more than dogs but @ CAPS1 will always be the first. My cats weren't really social with me, lazy there. What was so funny about my cats was that I named one of them @ CAPS14. I named this cat @ CAPS14 because it was all black but with white paws. It was funny because @ CAPS3 was always getting mad he was doing a lot of laps and jumps. It was a wild cat. I named one of my cats @ CAPS15 because he was so quick at everything. What was funny about him was that @ CAPS3 every time you play with him he runs off like he's eating a bowl of cat bite. Having animals in my life has given me a story of laughter in my life and happiness. I think laughter is a big part of relationships as well. If you are not laughing in your relationship then I believe the couple are not that happy. Laughter can be good a few times, but it can also be an insult too. If that means becoming an insult to some people or even making fun of people, it is rude. Laughter in your life is something that you should always keep as it can help you become happy in many situations and issues that you encounter in life. To be happy, you have to laugh.

Has @ CAPS3 ever had this moment with some that @ CAPS3 will remember forever and laugh about every time @ CAPS3 thinks of @ CAPS2. ? @ CAPS8 I have and think everyone should have a laughing moment in their life. The day of @ DATE1 was the day I will laugh at for the rest of my life. That day my boyfriend @ PERSON1 from @ LOCATION1 decided that @ CAPS1 wanted to take me for an early breakfast. @ CAPS1 called me around four in the morning to tell me that @ CAPS1 was hungry and @ CAPS1 needed food in his stomach. So @ CAPS1 picked me up around five in the morning and we went to @ ORGANIZATION1. We sat there, drank coffee and ate pancakes. We finished very early so @ PERSON1 wanted to go for a ride, let me call back @ CAPS3 @ CAPS1 from @ LOCATION1 so @ CAPS1 has @ CAPS6 clue where everything is in @ LOCATION2. As we head out of town, I give him directions as to where the best place is to go for a drive. We are in his pony @ DATE2 which is not the best vehicle to take a ride around this town, because here @ CAPS3 needs a four wheel drive vehicle otherwise @ CAPS3 is probably going to get stuck wherever @ CAPS3 goes. At first we were doing fine because we were staying on the paved roads, but @ PERSON1 wanted to explore the gravel roads. So we started to take a gravel road and we both decided that @ CAPS2 might be time to go home. When we got to another route, @ CAPS1 decided that @ CAPS1 was going to turn around. It wasn't the best idea. @ CAPS1 saw the street sign but @ CAPS1 turned the wrong way in a field. @ CAPS2 was fine, @ CAPS8 like the first @ CAPS2 was. Until @ CAPS1 is backing up and the car is not moving. I looked at it and laughed and said "I told @ CAPS3 that @ CAPS3 should go right and not left." @ CAPS1 then looked at me and said, "@ CAPS2 isn't stuck, I just need to try some more, and we'll be outside." One thing @ PERSON1 didn't know was that @ CAPS2 had been hot at @ LOCATION2 for the past few days so all the fields were very wet and soft. I looked at him and told him that @ CAPS1 might not want @ CAPS5 but @ CAPS1 said it was okay @ CAPS1 already did. So I got out of the car and I went myself standing on the edge of the road. @ PERSON1 tried to get the car out of the mud for at least ten minutes, and that wasn't the best thing for @ CAPS5, because now the tires were buried in the mud. I started laughing so hard because @ CAPS1 got out of the car and looked at me and said I should have listened. @ PERSON1 had one more thing @ CAPS1 wanted to try, because the @ CAPS6 offense but @ CAPS1 is a boy and they can @ CAPS5 all by themselves. So @ CAPS1 told me to get in the car and put @ CAPS2 in reverse so I did as @ CAPS1 said, then @ CAPS1 said okay, lightly press the accelerator while I push, @ CAPS8 I did a little more then press the gas lightly. I looked up and @ PERSON1 was covered in mud from head to toe. @ CAPS2 was the biggest thing I have seen in my life, my boyfriend got what @ CAPS1 deserved because @ CAPS1 wasn't listening to me. I looked at him and my eyes immediately started to cry, I was trying to hold back my laughter, but @ CAPS2 just wasn't working. I started to laugh and @ CAPS1 looked at me and said, "@ CAPS3 thinks this is funny ?" @ CAPS1 then got me out of the car and closed the door and started wiping mud off my face, I was laughing so hard I fell and took him with me in the mud. @ CAPS8 to make the story even better we went to open the car doors, and @ CAPS3 remember how I told @ CAPS3 that I put the car in reverse @ CAPS8 when @ CAPS1 m ' got out I didn't take @ CAPS2 gets out of reverse gear and his car locks when not parked. I then looked at it and said, “@ CAPS5 @ CAPS3 has an extra key on @ CAPS3 by any chance ? ” “@ CAPS6”, @ CAPS1 said, “@ CAPS7?” I looked at it and j I said: "@ CAPS8 lets see that the car is still running, the windows are up, our phones are still in the car and @ CAPS8 finally @ CAPS2 the doors are locked." @ CAPS1 looked at me and his mouth fell. We sat there waiting for almost an hour and a half before that someone down the road. @ CAPS2 has about forty-three minutes to unlock the doors, then @ CAPS2 took us about thirty minutes to take off @ CAPS2 When I got home I told my family the story, and we still laugh about @ CAPS2 to this day.

Like when someone is upset, @ CAPS2 makes you have a good laugh and feel better. Ok i know i make a few jokes here and there @ CAPS2 what i really like to laugh it feels good it makes me happy and other people happy. I'm in host family and can't go out @ CAPS2 laughter is a big part of my life right now. Even though I'm depressed, it makes me happy to hear someone else having fun. I miss hearing my parents laughing. My mom was an amazing mom, she had a funny laugh that made me smile, smile and burst. laughing. We always had a great time, I remember when my mom took her meds at TIME1 and the pills made her a little more hip. @ CAPS2 my own mom wanted to box me. @ CAPS2 I had boxing gloves and she just had her fists, @ CAPS3 my mom knew how to fight and stuff. @ CAPS2 this experience was a little scary. Okay enough @ CAPS5 my mom, @ CAPS4 my dad, he was an amazing man and dad. He worked hard to support me and my brother. When my brother and I were younger my dad always put on funny masks and did funny things to make me and my brother laugh. Or he would put on a scary mask and scare us to make him laugh. My dad would go rollerblading with us and try to trip us up but he couldn't always keep up and if you were going fast his legs would wobble and he would knock him down and me and my friends would laugh. All my parents after me and my family have been separated and it sucks, but the laughter for me is out there in @ CAPS4 world. I could have been my dad's twin, think twice @ CAPS5 that. What a laugh is everything @ CAPS5 "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people". And `` I @ CAPS6 think the laughter between two or @ CAPS7 people is an important part of everything @ CAPS8 from @ CAPS9. ''

 My grandpa always used to say, "Life is like a kaleidoscope, you can keep spinning and spinning and @ MONTH1 seems to change, @ CAPS1 really, repeating itself." @ CAPS1 I've always wondered if the statement really applies to life, and if so, why would we want life to go on on the same pattern, if it doesn't turn out the way we did foreseen. When I was twelve, my two little sisters and I were separated and three thousand miles were crammed between us. I was put here at @ LOCATION2 while they stayed at @ LOCATION1, where I was born. At first, the pain of those three thousand miles was devastating. it was as if two of my essential organs had been taken out of my body. Eventually time passed and the agony lessened @ CAPS2's hold on our lives. He @ MOIS1 seems cruel @ CAPS1 most of the time now, the thought of them doesn't cross my mind. maybe @ CAPS2 is true what they say, "out of sight, out of mind". @ CAPS2 sad to think how close my sisters and I were before the change. we did it all together. we are very close in age, the youngest and I are only separated from @ NUM1 years old. I remember all the times we were out on the wet days on @ DATE1. We would be as white as ghosts from all the sunscreen my mom was applying liberally to our skin. Times were different then, they were happy, I was happy. If I think about it, I can see us sitting on the shag rug in my bedroom, playing with dolls until the sunlight slowly fades into the darkness. If only I could relive that moment for even a second, then maybe I could experience that feeling of happy contentment again. Although a lot of time has passed since our separation, I still have those days when I feel my world is falling apart around me because they are so far away. I will call them and the questions are always uncomfortable at first, like between strangers who meet for the first time. I can feel the three thousand mile crust on my heart reopening and it's bleeding like I'm leaving again. I wonder why I bother to call if it hurts so bad? And then I hear it, like the beautiful sound of classical music to my ears, I hear them laughing. I have this feeling that I suddenly needed, I'm happy. With each chuckle my smile grew because I know I made them feel whole again and for a second I let them forget for as long as I really am. Their laughter makes those three thousand miles evaporate in the air. In those moments of laughter, I know we are close again that we are sisters, not strangers. It's true what my grandfather says, because no matter how my life changes, I will always have that feeling of total happiness when I hear the sweet laughter of my little sisters.

 I rested my back on the cold steel of the lockers trying to ease my nerves. “The @ CAPS1 game is everything we've worked for - every excruciating practice, every tedious exercise, and every game movie we've studied to the minute. That was all to get us ready for tonight. @ CAPS7 we are let's lose tonight, everything we worked on was for nothing. " I listened intently as @ PERSON1, our team captain, spoke. The words she chose for our pre-game speech were straight to the point, and anything but sugar coated. Glancing around the locker room, it was easy to see that each of my teammates were anxious. Emilie vigorously chewed what was left of her nails, while @ LOCATION1 preferred to show his discomfort by the incessant patting of his foot. @ PERSON1 finished his speech and with our group's break we entered the gym. The stands were filled with familiar faces from our small town. In a small part of the stands, there was a group of people wearing colors foreign to our school. The abrupt recall of @ CAPS1 brought my attention back to the warm-ups. The twenty minutes we had for warm-ups seemed to last no more than two minutes. The announcer started to state our starting line, but it was no use. The roar of the crowd overpowered the speaker system. It looked like @ CAPS7 everyone in our town of 5,000 was watching the game. Not an empty space was left in the stands. The bench vibrated under the trampling and applause of the crowd, threatening with each shock to collapse. The top five from each team headed to the center of the pitch to be briefed. With the loss of the tip, our team was quickly put under pressure. From the first possession of the game, we chased our opponent. The first two quarters ended in a draw. Feeling discouraged, my team gathered in the locker room for the time of @ DATE2. We entered the locker room a moment before my @ CAPS3. I took the opportunity @ CAPS1 for @ CAPS2 around the expressions of my teammates. Nothing but disappointment and fear crossed their faces. My @ CAPS3 opened the door and I instinctively braced myself for the throwing of keys against the wall or the crash of the notepad. My team had witnessed these acts of rage countless times before. To my surprise, my @ CAPS3 came in with complete poise and poise, because @ CAPS7 our first treacherous game @ DATE2 did not phase it. We weren't yelled at or criticized. Instead, he rubbed his eyes, face down, and shoulders hunched over. Her stomach began to shake, followed closely by her shoulders. My first guess was that he was crying, but to my amazement I heard the chuckle from our @ CAPS3. Soon that little chuckle morphed into a big stomach pushing chuckle. My team exchanged confused looks and eagerly awaited the explanation of my @ CAPS3. "@ CAPS2 to yourself !" @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 ordered. "@ CAPS5 are all more hesitant than when I asked @ PERSON2 to go to my first dance !" We could always count on @ CAPS3 for an unrelated metaphor. Even @ CAPS7, it wasn't basketball related, the point was clear. "The guys at @ CAPS7 @ CAPS5 would believe in you like I believe in @ CAPS5, the @ CAPS1 game would be a blow! Instead, @ CAPS5 is playing like a bunch of bunnies!" We all laughed at the thought of playing like the nursery rhyme we heard so often when we were kids. @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4's speech relieved us all. The confident team that we should have been from the start of the match was now ready to win the @ DATE2. To think that @ CAPS1's confidence came from a single heartwarming laugh seemed almost improbable. The whistle triggered @ DATE2. We played with such confidence and confidence that @ CAPS7 @ CAPS5 had to compare one @ DATE2 with the other, it would be @ CAPS2 like two different teams. We took the advantage early in @ DATE1 and held it for the rest of the game. Winning that night's game took us one step further into the state tournament. Heading back to the locker room, I took a look at the huge gym. I watched: the crowd, the scoreboard, the opponents, the referees and the journalists. I realized how easy it is to figure out everything that shouldn't affect @ CAPS5. All the distractions easily make @ CAPS5 forget why @ CAPS5 is playing the game. Sometimes we need reminders, like @ CAPS3's soothing laughter @ CAPS4. Without this reassuring laugh, my team would never have united and defeated our opponent.

Freshman year, season @ CAPS1. I've been @ CAPS1 for about eight years now, graduated from a school @ NUM1 to @ LOCATION1 my freshman year in high school. Being the only freshman on the varsity team, everyone knew who I was : “ The little boy from the varsity team @ CAPS1 ”. @ CAPS2 an eighth grader I won the junior state and struggled all the way through parentheses without @ CAPS1 a full match. This means I pinned everyone on the first round. I couldn't be touched. When I entered high school, I knew I wouldn't get @ CAPS2 as easily as I did in elementary school. I was absolutely right. My trainer had to be the funniest person I have ever met in my life. @ PERSON1 has been my @ CAPS3 teacher since class @ NUM2 and has been my role model throughout my life. He made the funniest jokes about the wrestlers on the team. A lot of people didn't like @ PERSON1 @ CAPS12 @ CAPS4 and he got along very well. I finished the first year of the season with @ NUM3 wins, @ NUM4 pins and @ NUM4 losses. I still haven't been pinned until @ CAPS13. This earned @ CAPS4 the wrestler of the year awarded by my trainer @ CAPS1 @ PERSON4. When the season went to the regional I knew I had a chance to go to the United States. There were six guys in my weight class and four of the six I've beaten at the start of the season. I just had to worry about my match before @ CAPS4 and fight without error. In the @ NUM6 pounds weight class there are a bunch of little kids. I was definitely the most experienced in my weight class. I sat down first seed. The second seed was @ PERSON2 from @ ORGANIZATION1. He lost weight so he could try to take my seat. My first match, I wrestled @ CAPS5 from @ CAPS6- @ CAPS7- @ CAPS8. The match was very short. I pinned it in about @ NUM4 seconds. After my match with @ CAPS5 I went to my trainer and he told @ CAPS4 a quote that I will never forget : "@ CAPS10, @ CAPS11 is alone at the top, @ CAPS12 the view is excellent." The quote @ CAPS13 stuck in my head for all of my next matches. I won my second and third games and I was in the semi-finals. I was one turn from going to the state automatically. I wrestled @ CAPS5 from @ PERSON3 and he weighed @ NUM8 pounds. I knew he was a good wrestler even though I had about @ NUM9 pounds on him. I was getting ready to wrestle and saw @ CAPS5 warming up in the gym from @ CAPS4. @ CAPS2 he was jumping around to warm up I see him trip and fall on his face. My coach saw the same thing and started laughing at him. @ CAPS11 was the funniest thing I have ever seen. I struggled throughout the game and pinned him in double overtime to go to State. My trainer walks up to @ CAPS4 and says "@ CAPS11 took you so long to nab someone who can't even warm up without falling in their face." @ PERSON1 had about three teeth in total in his mouth. He lost them in different ways. He was a man of adventure. He loved rafting and the sport of @ CAPS1. When I moved I was away from my idolized trainer @ CAPS1, @ CAPS12, we always contacted @ CAPS11 on Facebook and chatting. As of @ CAPS13, he's still the funniest man I know and still my idol.

A lot of people @ MONTH1 think that laughter is not a big part of a relationship. I really think having a good laugh with your spouse is a good thing because it means you are having a good time with each other. I'm going to tell you a true story where my girlfriend and I used to laugh and have a good time, and I'll talk about another time when laughter was a big part of my life. In the next few paragraphs @ NUM1, I will decide how much laughter helps @ CAPS1 in my life. laughter is above all about having fun and it should be aimed at hurting someone or making them angry or angry with you. I think some people really want to hurt people because they don't care what they say to other people and that's why laughter can hurt people sometimes. I said things to people that I found funny, but the person I was telling them didn't think it was funny. This first story that I am going to tell you concerns @ CAPS1 and @ LOCATION1. I've been dating @ PERSON2 for about a month now and laughing is a huge part of our relationship. @ PERSON2 and I love to tell each other jokes and make each other laugh and smile. If we weren't laughing and having a good time together, then this relationship would be okay. It wouldn't turn out the way I want it to. So I try everyday to make her laugh and smile at some of the things I say because it's an important thing in life for @ CAPS1 anyway. @ PERSON2 makes @ CAPS1 laugh all the time and I think that's a good thing for her because she can be a really funny person all the time. So, as long as longtime relationships involve laughter, most of them will last a while. The one person who I think made @ CAPS1 laugh the most is probably my dad. My dad, every day when he picks up @ CAPS1 he always has something funny to say. I don't think he hasn't said something funny one day in a long time. The times my dad has a bad day at work and then when he comes home and he's always in a bad mood, I try to say something funny to get him out of his bad mood, and if it doesn't not walking, I go to my room to get away from him. But most of the time my father comes home in a good mood because his job is very easy and he loves the people he works with. Now that would have been a different story if we were still living in I am @ ORGANIZATION1. When we lived at @ ORGANIZATION1 my dad had to commute between @ LOCATION2 and @ ORGANIZATION1. It was about an hour's drive one way, so that didn't put him in a great mood. but i didn't really see him much when we were living in @ LOCATION4. so whatever is funny i think i always try to say just to keep laughing. I believe laughter is a big part of having friends. most friends like to joke and laugh about things that are funny to them. So when you have a friend who likes to smile or who likes to tell jokes, he usually becomes friends and that person has more friends and the whole community starts to like him until he says something that drives a lot of people crazy. In our @ CAPS1, @ PERSON3, @ PERSON4 and @ CAPS2 baseball practices, we love to tell jokes or say something that will make the whole team laugh. another fun person for @ CAPS1 is @ LOCATION3. @ LOCATION3 tells a lot of jokes and has a funny exasperation, and the last person that's funny to @ CAPS1 is @ PERSON1 is one of those guys who thinks he's funny but really is. I think I have a good friendship relationship with all of these people. I just told you why I think a good laugh is a good thing in a relationship. It's good with your parents so that you can have a good relationship with them. Hope you liked my story. I enjoyed writing on this topic because it explains @ CAPS1 and explains what I do with my spouse and friends. I think everyone in life laughs day after day to keep a good attitude with people.

 When I was little I laughed at all I could, but when I was a kid who didn't? As I got older and older I developed a great sense of humor which to my advantage made me fun for young people. I grew more and more developing a stronger and more confident sense of humor. I always remembered making people laugh and loving the attention I got from humor. As my body got older and my humor got funnier, I had made myself more dependent on the pleasant personalities of my people. Moreover, I then learned on my own how to modify my voice and change my tone for a more humorous effect. It was a step that I knew was appropriate for advancing my humorous personality. I had no intention of losing my humor, so I used it to my advantage. I have used my humor to increase my @ CAPS1 count, to grab the attention of my peers who don't accept it, and to get the attention that I blossomed into. I had started to be accepted by higher peer groups who used to look down on me and it seemed like I got a lot of attention. Anything I could do to make my classmates laugh was a goal for me. Anything, from going down the stairs, telling jokes, making the teachers angry, what the students found funny, and sometimes destroying things. All this just so that I could fit in with the crowd that was rejecting me. As I progressed through high school I knew my humor needed to be improved to keep my classmates laughing, I just didn't know what kind of work I needed. That's when I started to lose my funny, humorous personality. By then I had fallen into the ranks of my peers, down to the children I once thought were called strange. I was friends with people who didn't always hold their heads up, were constantly depressed, and never seemed positive. I let the people I called friends drag me down when I knew I should be more at the top. It was my first major fall in which I had managed to lose my humorous personality. One of my friends in particular shot me down more than anyone, down to the fatherly level of being miserable. This so called "@ CAPS1" got me so far down that I needed therapy to help me get back to a normal level of happiness. I finally realized it wasn't fun to be someone @ CAPS1 who just dragged you down. I finally got free of that clutch when she moved out, I wasn't mean enough to say I didn't want to be friends with her, it was just too hard for me. When she moved, it allowed me to heal myself and pay more attention to my humor. I had broken my dark days and resumed my endless track of humor. It was difficult to accept the fact that I had lost my humor for what seemed like an eternity, and that I had lost my place in the social parenthesis that would be difficult to regain. But after a month of hard work and concentration on both school and humor, I had found my personality! Immediately after I regained my humor, I started to feel happier. I received more attention and felt like I was back where I needed to be, even though I was just a little lower. Back in the saddle of humor, back to the laughs of my peers, back to the smiles and especially the way I was. I had to get all my humor and my personality back, my tone, my voice and my jokes but it was worth it, in a weird way. As I now continue my humor as a junior and I have not yet successfully lost it, but there is still a future. I managed to turn the best thing I had into the worst I have felt within a few weeks and then back up. In the end it's not what you have that matters it's what you can do to make yourself happy and in the end I wouldn't change a thing!

I wish one day could go back. in @ NUM1 grade i was in the classroom i know my friends were with but i knew the teacher. I didn't know what I thought of her at @ CAPS1 but I have to get to know her because she has been my teacher for @ NUM4 years. in one of my meetings, my physical education teacher taught me to try on my shoes. every day in our diary we told a story about something i am talking about from @ PERSON2 and she will tell me anyway not to write about her say something new in @ NUM1 grade. my class and I had the opportunity to shop for a frip trip. in @ NUM6 my class read the book @ NUM7, we have a party. at some point on the time of @ DATE1 we all get together and have an ice cream party. when @ DATE2 comes around we all do a musical every year. in @ NUM8, when in school outdoors it was fun and cool.

  Laughter saved my life. Growing up, my life was pretty normal. Me, my little brother, mom and dad, all living happily together in a beautiful suburb. But two years ago, everything changed; and it looked like it wasn't for the best. My parents are divorced. It was very strange because at that time in my life I thought it couldn't happen to me; it was impossible. By telling my friends and family about it, I learned to live with the fact that my family would never be the same again. But thinking that I had familiarized myself with my new life, I was still miserable most of the time. But the times I was with my best friends and caring family were the times I forgot everything that was happening at home. George and I have been very close friends since the @ NUM1 class. We are inseparable. Although I have a lot of other friends, he is the one I would always turn to if I had a problem. He knows me better than anyone. We talk to each other every day at school, text each other every night and go out almost every weekend. The night my parents told me they would be getting a divorce, I called him crying. He told me that in the end everything would be fine, and he told me that he was always there for me if I needed anything. At that point, it was clear to me that I had something that not many people can say they had in their lifetime: a true friend who would be there through anything with me. He and I joked about all my problems. To some, this @ MONTH1 seems a bit strange ; but it was almost therapeutic for me. Making fun of my life made it easier for me to live it in a way. It helped me realize that I have to let go of the past, and that just because there is a bad patch doesn't mean the rest of my life is meant to be. George knew how to cheer me up, and he always knew when I needed a good conversation or a good laugh to improve my day. A girl always needs another girl in her life to tell secrets, do crazy things, and lie on the couch all day watching sappy love movies. For me, it's @ CAPS1. When we are together, nothing can stop us. She was always by my side during my parents' divorce. She was there with me, my last night in my house before I moved. We sat on my bed in my empty room, recalling all the memories the house had given us. Some would think it would be a sad time, but we just laughed. Because all the memories were good. We weren't crying because we were upset; we would cry laughing at all our crazy adventures for hours. For me, that's a pretty good reason to cry. We relived our best moments that night, and we weren't going to be upset by the situation. We wanted to make our last memory in my house a good one; which we will always remember. My family is quite strange; but we know how to have a good time. I don't have a lot of family members, but I think because we are so close together we get along really well. Whether we're in the backyard playing wiffle ball or at home doing pranks with whoopie cushions, it's always a fun time in @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1's house. During the difficult times of the divorce, I spent a lot of time at my @ CAPS2 because I didn't have to worry about being asked all the time about how I was feeling; I just had to wonder if I should bring sneakers for a hike or if I should bring my pajamas in case we decide to have a slumber party at the movies. This house is a place I always go to relax and forget about everything @ MONTH1 is worrying me about. @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1's is a haven for me to let go and have a good time with some of my favorite people in the world ; my family. If I hadn't had all of these important people in my life, I don't know what would have become of me. As I grow older, I realize that these people have shaped who I am today. They helped me through the most difficult times of my life, and it just goes to show how much they really care about me. Some say laughter is the best medicine; I say it's love. Laughing helps you through terrible times, but the people who make you laugh are really what matters most. I can honestly say that each of these people has made me a better person and I love them with all my heart.

 Life is serious business that must be taken into consideration. Life is what you make of it and I have done my best to achieve this ; even when it sounds crazy. It can be hard not to be the effect of the global chaos and daily epidemic, but it doesn't seem easier or less stressful to smile than to frown. Living life in the moment without worrying about what is going to happen just to be carefree, I would consider that exhilarating. To be nothing but the purest form of stillness. My childhood memories are faint, but I'm happy to say I do. Childhood happiness is the purest in my position. I yearn for that purity that I have had, as most do. This was my favorite pair of plastic barbie high heel shoes or my special princess backpack with every princess or @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. It was my parents making faces that made me laugh because I couldn't hold him back. All I wanted was a picnic under my favorite long green haired willow, feel as free as the birds, sing their beautiful songs and dance with an endless smile. It is the fragile youth of a child that I dreamed of. It is the fragile youth of a child. As life goes on, my purity has faded and the distance from people, community and myself grew until I felt lonely in the om soil. I had changed as a person when life burned me down one to many times. I felt that God had betrayed me if not hated me. I had then become a wall of cold stone that no one could penetrate. But as I looked in the mirror I haven't seen @ CAPS3 for life, just hate. This moment in time changed my perspective on life. My strong hatred for the world was starting to cripple me in various aspects if not the most important. If I couldn't open up to myself, how could I open up to the world? At @ CAPS3, learning, being free and growing was my ultimate goal. I learned the most important lesson within myself; the laughter and the cunning of being optimistic, compassionate and understanding. Someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” I think that's an honest opinion that deserves to be proven. Laughter has changed my life, my world, and it's a recurring symptom that I am proud of every day. In my most embarrassing, angry moments, and even my deepest sorrows, I always manage to smile. Helping people has helped me realize and understand that it is my passion. I want to help the world not to hide their pain, but just to realize that life can take a turn for the worse and end up being okay. Even in the darkest, deepest caves there is still a rock waiting to crumble to bring light. For me, it's always a light at the end of the tunnel. In my light - a smile can wear. I want to be that light. I want to be what comes away with a feeling that everything will be fine. so I live my life through a gracious smile. In my opinion if you create a smile and you will receive three more. This is my motto, "@ CAPS3 life for what it's new adventures brings, just smile, the world will continually turn as life goes on."

To laugh. Some might think it is just a simple reaction to something funny, but in reality, laughing can be a way of dealing with situations, expressing yourself, or just having fun when you are. are with friends. . For me the meaning of laughter has changed a lot over the course of my life, when I was younger I would laugh for fun or just to have fun with my peers but as I got older I used laughter to deal with situations. On @ DATE1 the morning of my @ NUM1 birthday I heard some disturbing and disappointing news that day I learned that my mother had passed away. When I first found out I didn't know what to do the only thing I felt I could do was cry and grieve about it and lock myself in a depressive phase, a lot of my friends tried to help me and tried to tell me ' things were going to be okay '. I knew they were right, but the only thing I could think of was that even if things turn out well, things will never be the same again. At that point I thought to myself what would @ CAPS1 look like ? what am i going to do on mother's day ? and my biggest question about how I was supposed to celebrate my own birthday ?. It's hard to know that someone I love and have been with for @ NUM2 years of my life is gone, but since my mom passed away I've tried to stay focused on the positives and what she would have wanted for me like to graduate from high school, to be successful and not let my life tumble. Even though every day is hard for me, I still try to get through it and just remember my mom wouldn't want me to give up my life because of her passing. You might be wondering how I deal with this loss, and the answer to that is that I have learned to deal with my situation with laughter. Growing up, my mother always told me that "laughter is the best medicine". And after I lost it, I realized that this statement was true. Now whenever I'm upset or sad I remember thinking about the memories I had with my mom and laughing at the good experiences and good times we had, and I even sometimes find myself in laughing at some of the arguments we've had. Laughter has helped me cope pretty well over the past four months since my mother passed away, and I hope this will continue to help me in the future, but I continually think " I can laugh. some things now, but what about ten years from now? ” I guess the future is going to be a mystery for that, but one thing I know about my future is that I will be successful, and even though laughter doesn't always work for me, I will stay strong and be sure to live my life like I would if I still had my mom, it will be hard to do without the guidance and authority to have my mom there, but luckily I don't face it all alone. One person who's been there through the whole situation has been my aunt, she's been in my life since day one, my mom and i even lived with her i'm thankful my aunt has been there for me for my life, if she wasn't i don't know where i would be in this m oment, she taught me that I cannot isolate myself or stop being a teenager just because I don't have my mother, but to live fully and live the life that my mother would have wanted to see me live, she also tells me that laughing at bad situations is not a problem and that you shouldn't lock things up and I'm very happy to have someone to go through that with. To have someone for me in such a difficult situation is very reassuring for me. Knowing that I have someone to talk to about the past and being able to have someone to laugh with. It's hard to laugh when you're doing it on your own, but one thing I've noticed is that when you have friends and family who are going through the same situation as you, it's easier to share your feelings and I think it also makes laughing easier. when you have people you are close to and people who care about you. In some situations, laughing might not be the best thing to do, but the best advice I can give to someone who might be going through a similar situation is to keep living their life and be something big and trying to release some of the stress of a situation by laughing with friends.

     Everyone laughs, I love to laugh actually it's one of my favorite things to do. If you're in a bad mood or just can't be happy, laugh at things because I'm sure it will lighten your mood and I'll tell you what, it's also very good for you in a lot of ways too. If people weren't laughing then this world would be a very depressing world, you smiling at someone who is not the happiest could totally change their mood. So like I told you before, I'm a very happy, energetic person and laughing is what I do best, and I smile at everyone around me. Well i have a story for you i love volunteering at homeless shelters and retirement homes because i believe i should share my happiness with everyone around me it makes me good to help people. This one afternoon I was doing what I do best laughing and having fun at the retirement home making people smile they all love having me around because they say I cheer them on. I run from room to room bringing vases of flowers opening their curtains to let in the beautiful sun, I always told them that vitamin @ CAPS1 is good for warming the soul. There was this man there who never had a smile on his face and I did the same to him as with the other residents and whatever I did he would never smile. Every time I walked in he always looked out the window with a dead look on his face so I asked the nurses why he was so cranky and calm and they told me he was a veteran. From what I understood he didn't have a lot of family, or at least they didn't visit him often, they just dropped him off because they didn't want to deal with the bad mood anymore. but i have a heart of gold and i feel i should share. I had decided one day that I was going to reverse that frown on his cute little face, and make him feel happy, smile and interact with the other residents. So as usual, I went in and did my daily routine in all the other rooms, we talked and had some laughs and all kinds of stuff. I had saved the little old man for last, wasn't sure what his name was or what his past was like, but I was going to go! I walked in and he was looking out the window as usual, I hesitated for a minute because I didn't know how he would react. So I went upstairs and started talking to him, introduced myself but he didn't look happy. I asked him his name and he told me it was none of my business and it totally knocked me down made me feel like I was the bad guy. So I started talking to him and asked him about his life, he slowly opened up to me and told me about everything he had seen in the @ LOCATION1 war. He turned out to be a nice guy, all those nurses got it wrong, they didn't even try. We laughed for hours, me and him, and it hasn't aged. Since I spoke to him he gradually started to interact with others, they just didn't give him time to explain his feelings or talk to someone. So think about it the next time you go to the store and see someone who doesn't seem to be having the best day, and smile at them !!! :)

 Have you ever had those weekends where you hang out your best friend and spend all your time laughing? A lot of people aren't fortunate enough to have a day filled with laughter because they don't have anyone to laugh with. In my case, I always laugh and always surrounded by people who never stop laughing. My best friend is one of the funniest people I know. I could be in the worst moods and @ CAPS14 always knows how to make me smile. @ ORGANIZATION1 and I hang out all the time. Whenever we @ CAPS11 together we @ CAPS11 constantly laugh to the point that we can't breathe. One day we were both having a difficult day. The whole drama with friends and boyfriends put so much weight on our shoulders. I was sitting at home on the couch when I got a phone call from @ ORGANIZATION1. "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS11 are you doing today ?" @ ORGANIZATION1 asked. "@ CAPS2 just sitting at home watching movies. You?" I replied "@ CAPS3 I'm having a bad day, would you like to come or something?" @ ORGANIZATION1 said in an annoyed tone. "@ CAPS4. Wait, let me ask you." I said running to my parents' room. My parents of course said yes. About an hour later I was picked up by @ CAPS5 dad. When I got in the car I could just tell by @ CAPS14's appearance that @ CAPS14 was having a bad day and just needed some fun. When we got home, we went to her room and started talking. About five minutes into the conversation, we were both crying like babies because of the issues that were occurring. we weren't just crying because of sad things. There was a point in the conversation where we laughed so hard that we started crying again. @ ORGANIZATION1 and I could sit there for hours and laugh until nothing stopped us. @ CAPS3 that day was the day. @ CAPS5 dad walked into the room because of all the noise. " Is @ CAPS1 going on here ?" " @ CAPS7 asked with a stern voice. "@ CAPS8 daddy." We always said laughing. "@ CAPS9 then." @ CAPS7 responded with a really confused face as she walked out of the room. Closing the door behind him. It made us laugh even harder. We laughed so much that @ ORGANIZATION1 fell out of bed. "@ CAPS11 you @ CAPS9 !" I tried to ask but it didn't really work because I was laughing so hard. All @ ORGANIZATION1 could do was roll around on the floor laughing. @ CAPS13 you knew @ ORGANIZATION1 you will know that once @ CAPS14 kicks in, @ CAPS14 thinks everything in the universe is funny, literally. The rest of the night we sat on his bed and talked about everything. Stuff that happened two years ago or that happened this week. I remember her telling me a story about when @ CAPS14 lived elsewhere and it was truly the funniest story I have ever heard. I've been her best friend for three years now and I never get tired of it. Some people hanging out with @ ORGANIZATION1 and I don't quite understand why half of the things we say are funny. A few months ago we were dating some friends and suddenly @ ORGANIZATION1 was screaming : "@ CAPS12 on my finger !" @ CAPS13 you were just supposed to hear that someone would turn you off @ CAPS2, but when @ CAPS14 screamed I started laughing so hard my stomach ached. Once while we were sitting in her bedroom @ CAPS14 wanted to paint my nails and @ CAPS14 chose this ugly brownish gold color. @ CAPS14 started painting my nails. "@ ORGANIZATION1 looks like I have @ CAPS12 on my finger !" I say in a loud voice. "I think that sounds very nice." @ CAPS14 responded with that certain smile on his face. Since that night @ CAPS12 on my finger has always been our inner joke. @ ORGANIZATION1 and I have the most fun time together. Times you can only have with a best friend. The hours we spend sitting there laughing at the simplest things you couldn't do with anyone else. I'm so grateful to have someone I can share all of these laughs with. Remember, you @ CAPS11 are lucky to have people who can make you laugh. Like I said, not everyone has this person in their life.

   Laughter “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.” - unknown. This quote means a lot to a lot of people. I am one of those people who believes this quote has a ton of truth and meaning. The best true story I can tell you that involves me and laughs is about me and my dad. When I was little and still lived with my dad, my mom argued with my dad all the time and neither of them were ever happy. My dad and mom both had good jobs, but they never had money to do anything because my mom loved spending money and both put them to service. My dad had to sell stuff to him all the time to help pay the whole department. My parents divorced which was a good thing for all of us. I spent time with my dad and found out how fun he is and how funny he can be. My dad and I started hunting and all kinds of things like that. I have found that my mom is even worse when she is happy because she gets so changeable and loud, or you could just say boring. She makes me laugh every now and then but it's always hers rather than her. I love being with my dad because I always have fun and learn something that will be very useful to me. I think laughter is important in any form of friendship. If you are careful about how you are with the people you love the most, you'll find that most of what you do is make each other laugh at each other.

A @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 A @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5. I just felt @ CAPS5. I was very stoic; my life was nadir. Powerless. I wrote a @ CAPS2 to my hero; no answers. I was determined to wait @ CAPS3 to see if my hero would ever respond ... My hero is amazing, bright, breathtaking ; his name is @ PERSON6. I understand his music. My best friend @ PERSON4 @ CAPS3 I was always talking about how awesome his music is; in fact @ CAPS6 @ CAPS4 started because of @ ORGANIZATION1. We were two different people; I didn't even think @ CAPS8 that we could be friends or have anything in common. The music of @ CAPS20 brought us together. @ CAPS17 @ CAPS3 I wrote a @ CAPS2 to @ LOCATION1; I was like "@ PERSON6 isn't even going to look at it", but I watched @ PERSON4 write the @ CAPS2. Weeks @ CAPS3 Weeks Spent @ CAPS3 I really thought @ ORGANIZATION1 was going to @ CAPS8 read or respond. After that, @ CAPS6 @ CAPS4 started to degrade. I felt discouraged; we only talked about the @ PERSON6 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS6 photography project. We really procrastinated towards the @ CAPS6 project ; I had been a bit distracted by high school homework @ CAPS3; not college homework. I ignored the calls @ PERSON4 the texts @ CAPS3. Until I realized I had made a bad choice; @ CAPS15 I called my friend @ PERSON4 - thank goodness I did. One week later @ PERSON4 @ CAPS3 I @ CAPS3 two of my friends: @ PERSON5, my best friend since seventh grade; @ LOCATION2, my best friend since eighth grade, had gone to see this movie really vehemently. After the film, we went to meet some friends in the dormitories. On the way @ CAPS6, @ PERSON2 @ CAPS3 I was talking to @ PERSON5 @ CAPS3 @ PERSON4 about @ CAPS6's incredible experience in the field of health : @ CAPS6 the health teacher had given us an assignment on what should look like a perfect body. @ PERSON2 @ CAPS3 Me, facetious, I made a body of extraterrestrial appearance. This alien's toes were sticking out of his shoes @ CAPS3 @ CAPS6 alien had warts all over it. We laughed all the time, obviously we didn't make it to @ CAPS8. When we got to the dorms, @ CAPS3 @ PERSON4 introduced me to his friend @ CAPS8.J; @ CAPS18 was a huge fan of @ ORGANIZATION1. "@ CAPS9." @ CAPS10 we have played various games. I noticed that @ CAPS8.J had warts on his hands, @ CAPS3 when @ CAPS18 took off his shoes ; to put on his saddles I was able to '@ CAPS8 help but I noticed that @ CAPS18 kinda reminded me of @ CAPS6's drawing. I started laughing hysterically all the time my friend @ CAPS12 kept asking me why I was laughing I said "@ CAPS8.J looks like my alien", @ CAPS18 said "wow that's rude ". I said "In my eyes, this is the perfect body." We all had a good laugh @ CAPS3 continued to play @ CAPS3 games while listening to @ ORGANIZATION1. The next day @ PERSON4 @ CAPS3 I was to meet, to work on the @ CAPS6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was take pictures of each other @ CAPS3 the things we like @ CAPS3 don't like. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @ PERSON4 during this project. In my opinion sometimes I live life too fast, @ CAPS3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but the school @ CAPS3 the sport sometimes held me back; not bad. I just have less time to go out with friends or just rest. But I love my life @ CAPS3 would trade it @ CAPS8 ; everything I do brings me closer to my goal: @ CAPS14.BI agent. This project was vehement. For me, it was a @ CAPS1, a way of life that told me " Wait, you'll get there " ; all with just one call. We were working hard when @ PERSON4's phone kept ringing. I was a bit cantankerous. I said "@ PERSON4 answers the phone!" @ CAPS15 @ CAPS18 did it. @ CAPS18 said "oh my god, @ CAPS16 is @ PERSON6, I said" stop messing around, now let's get back to work! "@ CAPS17 put his phone on speakerphone, @ CAPS3 it was there; my hero on the phone! I @ CAPS15 was happy that I started to cry, how could this happen to us ! passed out it was like I was stoic How could this happen to “ everyday teenagers .” I could hear @ PERSON4 talking to @ ORGANIZATION1 but I was making my life difficult. I took a breath of fresh air, @ CAPS3 said “hello.” When I woke up @ PERSON4 @ CAPS3 I couldn't @ CAPS8 believe it We cried, then to ease the tension, @ PERSON4 a Said “@ CAPS16, you talked to your husband.” We laughed for a long time. @ CAPS17 @ CAPS3 I have the best memory together. @ CAPS6 @ CAPS4 started because of the music from @ CAPS20, @ CAPS3 it will never end. That day I realized : one : miracles happen ; two : laughter heals the heart ; @ CAPS3 three : always have faith, never give up, someone you ente ndra always @ CAPS3 give you advice when everything seems to be falling on you @ CAPS3 if it's like @ PERSON1 said "jump off a cliff, @ CAPS3 built your wings on the way down", or someone will help you build them ! As @ PERSON6 said "Come take my hand, we are going to walk this road together."

 On a hot day in @ DATE3 in the middle of @ DATE1 and I was having fun camping at @ LOCATION2. @ PERSON1 and his family took me on their camping trip. We stayed at their @ CAPS1, our campsite was right by the ocean so we went there for walks daily. We stayed at @ LOCATION2 for a week. During this week I think the @ DATE2 her older sister gave birth she lives at @ LOCATION1 which is a fairly long drive from @ LOCATION2. That morning @ PERSON1's mom and dad woke us up very early in the morning around 6.30am, @ PERSON1 and I had been standing @ TIME1 until around 3.30am so we were pretty tired by then . We found out we were going to take a small plane from @ LOCATION5 to the airport from @ LOCATION4 and got it pretty cheap because @ PERSON1's brother works there. Feeling like we knew we had a long day ahead of us with only about three hours of sleep, we both drank really strong coffee to keep us alive. Then we went to the airport the whole way, we laughed at everything, road signs, building names, funny birds, songs, we also have @ CAPS2 accents we pronounce every word, so it was even funnier. My stomach muscles were aching so much that I didn't know if we were laughing because things were really funny or if we were delusional that we didn't get much sleep and on top of that on a surge of caffeine and sugar. Once we got to the airport, we still couldn't stop laughing. @ PERSON1's parents were frustrated with us even though we broke them too. We all got on the plane and sat next to each other of course. We still swear to this day that we had a secret agent sitting behind us, he was wearing spy glasses, a suit and an earpiece @ CAPS3 the secret agents wear that protect the president we kept making up stories about what he made we couldn't stop laughing. Finally, he started talking to us. We were so excited that he was telling us all the places he was going, the place I remember the most is @ LOCATION3 a secret agent ! We knew it then. We thought how awesome a job is ! Of course @ PERSON1's parents interrupted " I'm sorry sir, are they bothering you ?" " @ CAPS3 we were kind of a parasite, he replied" of course not, I have nothing better to do. " We even made him laugh so hard he was crying, I guess you could tell we're pretty funny when we're together. The best part was when her mom was having anxiety about flying i mean it's not funny but she made it funny because she said things like "oh my gosh was going to crash, the girls shut up, you freaked me out "etc. @ PERSON1 and I took advantage of the situation and scared him even more. finally we landed. At the airport we went to the restroom and there were free toothbrushes so we took some @ PERSON1 took a green one and I took a pink one. we've been using them all day in pictures and everything. Then we took a rental car and drove to the hospital still laughing at everything we had in the hospital and finally saw the baby she was so cute. We started to settle down once in the room. After about an hour we went out to eat, we were all so hungry. We ate then had to sit down and waste three hours, we went to the mall then to @ PERSON1's family house where we crashed! @ PERSON1 and I were dead! but we still had the flight home, dreading every step, we didn't know how we were going to do it. Finally, we got on the plane, returned to the camp, and went to sleep. It was one of those days that I had to be there, I can't put words to the emotion and the laughter, it was so funny. We're best friends for a reason that certainly wasn't boring and which I think keeps us so close.

  Laughter is the best medicine for me, and indeed a big part of any good relationship. This is particularly good for a serious couple who forgot to laugh. Also for those who could use their uplifted mood. I know that laughter has made my relationship so much better. In begging, my relationship with my boyfriend was not that good. We barely laughed among ourselves, let alone talked much. Only with friends could we laugh and have a good time. Even though we weren't a lot of pranksters anyway. All we could do was get mad or say nothing. Even though the joke was funny. Well that all changed one night when we decided to go to @ LOCATION1 and play a few tricks on @ CAPS1. When we got there, we were in a pretty bad mood, and I was very angry. After we sat down, the mood relaxed a bit. Then we finally started talking and then a small explosion sent us practically rolling on the ground. We were breaking down. Red and breathless faces. We laughed so much we almost cried and the jokes didn't stop. Our moods totally changed once this happened. We couldn't even remember why we were upset. Almost as if the anger had just vanished. It wasn't long before we realized how ridiculous we were and that it's okay to joke, as long as it's not mean. Later we went to a friend's house and had a great time. We told a few good jokes, laughed a lot and had a blast. Then, after dark, we decided to come home and we were still making jokes. I don't know what it was that night, but for the first time in a long time we were smiling and happy. Sharing this experience allowed us to truly connect with each other. Not only that, but it made our bond stronger and brought us closer together. Our relationship has been excellent ever since. You can laugh and have a good time, without being so serious all the time. I now know why laughter is so important in a relationship. Despite our little bad-tempered setbacks, all these jokes reminded me that laughter is by far the best medicine there is. He did things others never could. Some @ MONTH1 don't think laughing is the best, but I think it is. Those little laughs every now and then @ MONTH1 doesn't sound like a lot, but trust me, there is so much more than you might think. Laughter is everything to me. After what he has done for me and my boyfriend, I don't know how I would live without it.

  I like to laugh ! Laughing makes me satisfied and happy. When I laugh with someone I don't know, I feel like I've known them for a long time. When I laugh with someone I know, I feel completely satisfied. But there is one person I love to laugh with above all else, my cousin @ PERSON1. I think laughing is an important part of our relationship because when we laugh it's magic. Magical as in the speed and @ CAPS5 it takes to make one of us laugh. We'll say almost anything, the most random but the most humorous things, and then laugh until we literally cry. A @ TIME1, while we were talking on the phone, we decided to call our other cousin anonymously. When he didn't pick up, we hung up disappointed. I was thinking of the @ CAPS1 movie that I had just watched a few hours ago and an idea slowly started to come to me. I started talking in @ CAPS1 to my cousin, pretending I was our aunt at @ LOCATION2. I told him I was coming for a visit to @ DATE1 @ CAPS11, they better get ready. I love my nice, soft bed, plush pillows, and my own bathroom. I was the difficult aunt. I want everything to be perfect for when I come. We laughed and laughed. Then @ PERSON1 tells me : "@ CAPS3 don't call @ CAPS4 anymore and if he doesn't answer, we'll leave a message." “@ CAPS5 shall we say in the post ?” I asked. “@ CAPS6 is just going to say @ CAPS6 is his aunt from @ LOCATION2 and @ CAPS6 is coming for a visit and everything else @ CAPS6 is just going to make up.” “@ CAPS7,” I said hesitantly. I dialed the star six seven then its number and hit talk. Fortunately, no one picked up. But when the answering machine beeped to allow me to record a message, I was speechless. Then I started in my picky aunt voice, “@ CAPS8 @ CAPS4, it's your aunt @ LOCATION1 and me…” I burst out laughing before I could continue. "I .. I am coming for a visit to ..", once again I exploded. I could hear @ PERSON1 laughing in the background which made me laugh even louder. I tried again this time to go further in the story by laughing here and there. By the time I hit the maximum time for the message, I was @ CAPS11 in it that I didn't want to stop. When the message ended, I was only halfway there. @ CAPS11 once the answering machine finished speaking, I pressed two for my message here. Listening, I couldn't help but think of @ CAPS5 as a complete idiot that I looked like. @ PERSON1 kept silencing me whenever I laughed too hard, but I could tell she wanted to laugh too. She was only holding him back. When I hung up I called her back and when she answered I said, "@ CAPS10, start over because I haven't finished." @ CAPS11 we called back and this time I said the rest more willingly and barely laughed. I was saving it for when we listened to it. When we had our dose of laughter and wiping away the tears, @ PERSON1 said, "It was the most hilarious thing we've ever done together, we have to do it again someday." "Of course," I tell him. But it was late in @ TIME1, and it was time to go. When we finished our goodbyes and I love @ CAPS6, we hung up. This @ TIME1 and every time I laugh I think @ CAPS5 would be like no one can laugh. @ CAPS5 a boring place that would be, @ CAPS5 a lifeless life. When I laugh, I feel alive. I want to live for a laugh another day. If there was no laughing, it would be a shame, because I like to laugh a lot.

 For me, laughter shows the importance of life. I've always believed that any situation, be it @ CAPS3 or a bad laugh, can completely change the way people deal with those situations. When it comes to a relationship, just laughing can help anyone. Laughter symbolizes happiness and it is more than important for people in a relationship to be happy. I have had many horrible situations where just laughing has helped us get over it. Laughter has always changed @ CAPS1's mood and helped me get through situations. When you get so upset about the little things that you forget the @ CAPS3 things in life and start losing your patients to each other, it has happened to me a lot. One time this happened to me was when my boyfriend and @ CAPS1 were on their way to @ LOCATION1 and it seemed like everything was wrong on this trip. We went to @ LOCATION1 for a vacation away from our busy home life and ended up wishing we were somewhere other than where we were ! They had overbooked our hotel, our car broke down, the @ CAPS1 credit card account was helped for @ NUM1 hours and it looked like this trip was the biggest mistake we ever made. There was so much tension between us that we couldn't even look at each other without a fight. We ended up going to a cheap hotel and spending the only money we had. The next morning things got so bad that just being in the same room made us want to fight and kill each other. He ended up leaving for the day and we didn't speak to @ TIME1 when he returned, but even when he returned after not being together or a day, it was still difficult to be together. The next morning we woke up and by that time we were both fed up and had more than enough. The only thing we did was mope and fight it made us realize we were really stuck and this vacation could not be called a vacation anymore. There was no one we knew to lend us money, no banks just a @ CAPS2 and we realized that we were not at our dream vacation destination rather like a nightmare. We had all but given up and lost our faith in having a "vacation @ CAPS3" and we had surrendered to each other. We were done, we didn't want anything to do with each other or this nightmare anymore. This nightmare had ruined who we thought we were and we no longer saw each other as a happy couple, but rather as two people who completely despised each other. The next day I decided to call the bank @ CAPS1 and see what was happening with the account @ CAPS1, it turned out that I had forgotten that I had changed the pin number @ CAPS1 to access to the @ CAPS1 account. The whole time I kept entering the wrong pin code so they locked the @ CAPS1 account to make sure someone was trying to break in. I couldn't even describe how stupid I felt. I knew as soon as I got back with the news, even though it seemed like things were going well, they wouldn't. When I got back to the hotel I could feel the tension as soon as I entered the room. I started packing stuff @ CAPS1 and when he figured out what I was doing he asked me where I was going I said "luxury". Instantly his face lit up and he asked "how" and after I explained what had happened he immediately started laughing and hugged me. As soon as I saw that smile on her face and heard the laughter, I knew things between us would be okay after all. We finally had the money to rent a car and arrive at our dream destination. When we got to the hotel things were going well, we were smiling and laughing and really having fun. I can honestly say that although all of these horrible situations happened, I enjoyed our trip. I firmly believe that everything happens for a reason and that reason has led to a week full of laughter and true happiness.

 Laughter is necessary to survive in this crazy and beautiful world. It is something that we have with us throughout our life. As humans we get old and eventually die, but laughter never does. He lives forever. Laughter is often called the “best medicine”, and why shouldn't it be? He brings joy to the sad, relief to the overwhelmed and life to the depressed. The best part about laughing is that it's totally and unchangingly free ! No one will ever have to pay to earn a drop of laughter. On the other hand, laughter is also contagious. A single smile, a nod back and a loud laugh can make an entire room sick because of this glorified plague. Laughter is the best liberation. When I was younger I had a neighbor named @ ORGANIZATION2. @ PERSON1 was an older man who spent most of his time in his carpentry shop. He never spoke to the rest of us on our street and we didn't try to strike up a conversation with him. Day after day, I noticed that his little red pick-up left in the morning and returned in the evening. Her life was more like a routine and I was curious as to why. @ PERSON1 had a wife who also became a vampire to the rest of us. It was absolutely good, because for us she was a monster. Countless times, soccer balls were thrown around her yard by sheer accident and she came out of her quiet house screaming and waving her hands in our direction. She even left a note on my family's front door telling them to "take better care of your lawn". I sympathized with @ PERSON1 to have to live with the woman. Something in her voice sounded wrong, like she was deaf. This aspect of her life always made me feel a little bad for her. Being different could have been a possible explanation for why she treated people the way she did. I will never forget the day the ambulance pulled up in front of their perfectly serene home. I sat on my porch, silently watching the doctors enter the house. Shortly after, I heard the little red pickup truck pull up on the road. I knew, like everyone on @ ORGANIZATION1, that this was not part of the routine. After approximately @ NUM1 minutes, a body was transported on a stretcher. My heart sank. Even though I was young, I knew the meaning of a white sheet hovering over a being. @ PERSON1 was very isolated after the death of his wife. No one could blame him. He lost the love of his life; he lost his routine. My family chatted and decided to bring him some meals. Food was never anything particularly fancy, just something to keep him going. I have never seen someone so grateful. Yet we knew we had to stay out of his lawn. His wife loved it and he must have felt like she was still attached to it somehow. He was alone and my family wanted to be there for him. Soon after we brought the meals, my younger sister and I started walking her fluffy white little dog and invited him to dinner as often as our mom allowed. He has become more of a grandfather than a neighbor. One day my friends and I were outside playing soccer on our back street. It was nice and warm outside. Life was good. I could feel the liveliness of youth pounding in my veins as I ran. From there the ball rolled into @ ORGANIZATION2's backyard. We all hesitated when we saw his door open. He looked harassed and quite upset as he slowly bent down to pick up our ball. I winced, knowing my parents would tell me about it later. Then the unexpected happened, @ PERSON1 started to laugh. The kind of laughter where a person can be considered crazy to be so happy. The kind of laughter where tears run down a person's face. Not knowing what to do, my friends and I started to laugh on our own. @ PERSON1 threw the ball at us and went back inside. His laughter was a clear signal, the grieving and unhappy soul of @ ORGANIZATION2 had been relieved. Since then, laughter has meant a lot to me. Laughter can direct you directly to a person's soul. It can be the link between people. Without laughing, life can seem dull. Once it is introduced into your life it has the power to heal and restart. This is exactly what he did for @ ORGANIZATION2. Through laughter, he regained his life.

So one day I was home babysitting my little brother. It was a super boring day. So go check my emails, and I get an email from my boyfriend. I was excited to talk to him because my phone was taken from me. I opened it and it was a breaking email. It was so shocking. I want to cry. So I called my mom on the landline and asked if my best friend @ PERSON1 could come. My mother said yes. I called my best friend @ PERSON1 and told her what had happened and asked her to come. At that moment, I was crying with my eyes. @ PERSON1 said yes to come ! @ PERSON1 is my best friend in the world! She always knows what to do and say when I'm upset. I have been waiting for it for a long time. Her mom always takes forever when she does things. She finally arrives at my place, and she gives me a big hug! We are always there for each other. I've always been there when all of @ CAPS1's boyfriends dumped her, so it was nice for her to be for me this time. I haven't had as many boyfriends as she does. So we go to my room, and I'm still crying. I couldn't stop. It was like a river running over my face. Being dumped really is a horrible feeling. He was the best boyfriend ever, so the fact that he sent me wasn't like him at all. @ PERSON1 was just sitting there texting. I was wondering why you are writing just to comfort me. I didn't want to say it so I didn't. So we started talking and decided to go to the mall. It's still a fun place. So we ask my mother. She has just returned. She said no. I really didn't want to be home anywhere, it was better any home then. So we went back to my room, I was still crying. So @ PERSON1 started to say bad things about my ex-boyfriend. I knew things weren't true, but it was really, really funny. We were both laughing really hard and I was starting to feel better! Yay @ PERSON1 who makes stupid jokes about ex-boyfriends ! Laughter is the best way to make everything better!

 The thought of seeing him and hearing his laugh never failed to make me smile. I was starting to come to terms with the fact that it was a urge that I couldn't fight anymore. His sense of humor was the best I had encountered and it made my heart beat faster. For me, the best part of a relationship is getting to know each other and exploring the little things that make that person who they are. One trait I always look for is someone's humor and when I can find it easily, I thrive on it. My story takes place almost a year ago, as my first year of school was drawing to a close. I had a suitcase of new memories that I intended to take with me, but one still had to be added. I walked around the art class only NUM1 seconds behind on a particularly average day. The musty smell of rain and old paint settled in the air, which I had grown used to. Instinct told me to sit down, so with my headphones blocking out the rest of the world, I did. I paused my music to allow my surroundings to focus. A very sarcastic voice rose in front of me. "@ CAPS1 here we go ! You're late." @ CAPS2 the professor had moved all of our seats, I couldn't help but laugh at myself too. However, my seat remained unchanged, the only new aspect was the people sitting around me. I greeted the familiar faces with a smile as the class began. The teacher spoke about art related topics that I was far beyond, so out of habit I vaguely paid attention. I was much more focused on the person sitting across from me. I had never spoken to this boy, but there was something very intriguing about him. We said a few words on this school day. As the next day approached, I continued my usual pattern of walking into the room and sitting in the same spot. It had escaped me that a stranger was going to sit in front of me. He turned around the room and took his place. @ CAPS2 what I forgot made me excited. Today was a free day of work, a time to be social and work at our own pace. The perfect opportunity for me to learn something that has nothing to do with art. I introduced myself casually, trying to fit the personality to my words. His introduction was much less enthusiastic. The fact that he wasn't interested made me thrive to try harder. I started to be myself and act like I've known him for years, even though his name was brand new to me. It was then that I caught his interest and conversations started to flow. At the end of the day, I hadn't completed the job I was supposed to have, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I had just met such an attractive new person. Every day was the same, but I had taught myself a good balance between work and conversation. I couldn't get enough of this person I had just let into my life. Everything he said interested me and every word attracted me. I'm sure everyone in the room knew how funny I found him because of how often my laughter filled the room. It didn't take long for me to become very attached to him and every hysterical thing he said. After a few weeks, the class time was no longer enough for us, and he made the decision to call me. I intrigued him too. So our time spent talking didn't stop at the end of the school day, but extended to our phone conversations. More time passed and it became usual to talk to him often. I didn't have to pretend I had known him for years anymore. It had been well over a month and a half in our relationship when comfort began to set in for me. However, with familiarity came a sense of questioning. I was starting to open up to him very well, but I wasn't getting the same in return. I was telling him something from my past and he didn't care; I was explaining an opinion to myself and he would pretend to have the same. I had never laughed so much in so few days, but it was time to feel more than pretend hysteria. I wanted to be able to say personal things to him, but also to get something from him. I began to realize that I was digging deep in shallow water. The amount of laughter in this relationship clouded my judgment of the person beneath the humor. I couldn't connect with him on anything other than simple things. I still wished he was a part of my life, to always enjoy his company, but I didn't need to dig deeper. It was time for me to find new waters to swim in.

 One day, on a stormy night, I went to the wood shed to look for wood. The wind was beating the trees and all the coyotes in the distance were barking at the moon. I took one piece at a time, trying to make sure the pile didn't fall on me. As I watched my step, I lost my footing on a small cylindrical log about a foot long and hit my head. My brother came out to find out what was taking me so long and happened to my unconscious body. He took me to the store which is connected to the pyre to shelter from the cold and lit the oven to keep me warm. In doing so, he accidentally locked the door from the outside, which locked him and me in the store. As I woke up from my light sleep with a terrible headache, all I remembered was the rain pounding against the side of the pyre. @ CAPS2 was sitting next to me with a sad look on his face and also some shock. He told me what happened with the locked door and how we would never go out until morning. I looked around trying to find something to open the door but couldn't find out what it was. My parents couldn't hear us during the storm because they were sleeping and we were helpless no matter what we tried. So instead of looking on the dark side, we decided to do some stories and tell jokes to pass the time until it was morning again. While making a game called @ CAPS1, we found out that we had a lot of similar interests and also laughed at the same jokes. as we laughed, time seemed to pass as if we were in a time warp. after three hours it looked like we were both hungry and I had a few snacks in my pockets. so we sat by the furnace and ate and told jokes about our friends and relatives and the laughter kept us cheerful for another three hours. After a while we started to hear the storm start to leave the sky like a ghost leaving this world for another life. We started making fun of different movies and it's actors and actresses. I started talking about the size of @ PERSON1's ears and we both started laughing uncontrollably, then he came back to me with the size of @ ORGANIZATION1's lips and I laughed so hard that I couldn't breathe. we looked through the holes in the store to see the morning dew on the grass and the birds chirping in the trees and knew it wouldn't be long before we were found. While waiting for our parents to come find us, we looked at each other and said thank you. We both knew saying it wasn't for all the times that I tried to get us out of the store or for @ CAPS2 pulling me into the store, no it was for the time we have spent together and we laughed. It brought us closer together than we already were and it also gave us a memory of laughter that we spent together instead of a night of disaster and horror. We have treasured this memory ever since this happened, even though we @ MONTH1 sometimes fight over the smallest thoughtless things and laugh at each other, we know deep down we are doing it for love.

@ PERSON1 The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 with friends are among the best @ CAPS2 of my life if it is an adventure or just an outing @ CAPS1 @ CAPS3. I fished for stergion for the first time in my life with my buddy @ PERSON2, I haven't known him for a long time because I just moved to a new school so I just met him and thought it was a pretty cool guy, he invited me to go fishing with him so I decided to give it a go. We woke up after only sleeping two hours the night before because we were up all night messing around with a weather @ CAPS1. The alarm went off at @ TIME2 and we were dead tired, we got the boat ready and we were on our way to the river @ LOCATION1, we go there and unloaded the boat in the river, it was far away coldest I have ever been and I don't know if I was going to have fun because I was wet and cold and tired, finally the sun came out and it started to heat up and we were on the water at @ TIME1 and the polls were ready. We drove the boat to where we were going to fish, everyone said we are stupid to go to this place because it wasn't @ CAPS1 but my friends dad was one of the best fishermen I have met so I went with the current they taught me some tips and before I knew it we were catching some fish having a @ CAPS1 'ol weather. Around midday it was lunch time, but no one really wanted to eat because we were catching so many fish, so we waited a while and finally started having lunch, talking about all the fish that we were catching. we fished and all the fun we had. . As the day wore on and the sun got lower and lower with the temperature we caught a bunch more fish and it was time to get out of the water so we all limited ourselves and turned around at the dock to load the boat back onto the trailer and come home, on the way home all we could talk about was the fishing that day and how much fun it was and how many fish we caught.

                       Laughter @ CAPS1 is like a drug that works better than any other pain reliever or antidepressant. It makes angry people happy and happy people ecstatic. One of the best and most common ways to have a good laugh is to watch a funny movie. Whenever I am asked for your favorite comedy from @ CAPS10, I say "@ CAPS2 with @ PERSON1". I remember the first time I watched a movie @ PERSON1. I was about @ NUM1 years old; I was in second grade, it was towards the end of the school year, and I couldn't wait to go out for @ DATE1 and have some fun. It was any ordinary boring day at CAPS7 school and I remember coming home hoping that there would be something fun to do when I got home. I walked through the door to see my brother watching @ CAPS3, I asked him @ CAPS10 that he was watching but he just ignored me so I went to my room to do my homework. I finished my homework and walked into the living room and collapsed on the couch next to my brother, asked @ CAPS10 he was watching a second time, he gave an annoyed sigh and said a movie called "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5" was about to start. In the first five minutes we were already @ CAPS1, not just laughing or laughing lightly, tears were streaming down our faces from all @ CAPS1. I remember telling my brother "@ CAPS6 is the funniest movie I have ever seen!" @ CAPS7 the end of the movie, my brother and I couldn't stop quoting the movie, every @ NUM2 seconds we were quoting it, it was nonstop laughter. We sat there on the couch patiently waiting to see @ CAPS10 was next to wish and hope this was another movie as amazing as the one we just watched, and of course after the commercial break we have learned it was a @ PERSON1 marathon, and on the next one was "@ CAPS8 @ CAPS9". The movie started out just as funny as the last one, with @ PERSON1 doing something completely silly, yet absolutely hilarious, like growling @ CAPS7 dogs on a loudspeaker. We couldn't get enough of @ CAPS6 guy, my brother was rolling around on the floor @ CAPS1 and crying, and I was still watching waiting to see @ CAPS10 happen next. About halfway through the movie my mom got home from work, she came in to see my brother and me having a hysterical breakdown, she said "@ CAPS10 is that funny?" We just pointed @ CAPS7 to @ CAPS3 just as @ PERSON1 was starting to roll down a hill. Soon our mom was watching him too, @ CAPS1 as hard as us. I was having a great time, really having a great time with my family, @ CAPS10 more could I ask ? How about another @ PERSON1 movie ? The next one was a movie called "@ CAPS12 @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14", completely ridiculous and completely hilarious, @ CAPS10 is funnier than an overweight guy trying to be a @ CAPS14 ? We continued to watch the movie until dinner time, inhaled our food as fast as we could, then rushed over to the couch to continue watching. When it was time to go to bed, I remember staying up late reciting quotes from the movie in our bunk beds until our mom came in and told us to shut up. Not sure how we slept @ CAPS7 after @ CAPS1 all night. The movies left us speechless, we had never seen @ CAPS2 funnier, they made us laugh, they made us cry, they made us stomach ache, and through it all, it brought us closer to my brother and me. On the day @ CAPS6 my brother and I can sit and watch one of those movies and laugh and remember all the times we've seen them before and all the laughs we've shared I swear half of my childhood consisted of @ CAPS1 and @ PERCENT1 of what @ CAPS1 came from these movies. The movies helped me develop a funny personality, they shaped @ CAPS10, I think it's humorous, and they make me realize that after sharing something so funny with someone I love , this laughter is an important aspect of our life, without it life would be plain and dull like an insignificant drop of clay. Have you ever spent a day without @ CAPS1 ? If so, you know how long and boring it can be without having something to make you smile. Laughter brings people together, it brings out the best in us, when you are angry or upset the best way to heal your anger or frustration is to have a good laugh.

 I think laughter should be a part of everyone's life. For example ; laughter brought my mom and me closer than we've ever been. We were once sitting in his RV and we hadn't been together for a whole month, so we let it all out, and laughing was one of the things. We were laughing at the false teeth, we laughed so hard I jingled my mom's pants. We talked about false teeth for about an hour. I think laughing makes everyone feel better about themselves, too. Laughing is a good way to show someone you know how to have fun, and it's not a bad thing. For someone, knowing how to laugh and have fun is a good way to start a friendship or even a relationship. Another example is; @ CAPS1 I'm with all my friends, I can never stop laughing, and I like it because I'm not sad. @ CAPS1 I was a little girl in my family and I went to Disneyland and it was the moment of my life, there was not a single moment @ CAPS1 I wasn't laughing with everyone. One thing i dont understand is how someone cant laugh or smile at least @ CAPS1 someone says or does something funny. Well back to my story of my mom and I we were all tired and had a long day and the false teeth made us all laugh, and it was the best time I think I ever had with my mother. I've always said to everyone I know "live your life while you can, you don't know how long you'll have it". I think these words are very true and as you live your life laugh. My grandfather is quite funny with @ CAPS1 he is in a good mood he always makes everyone around him laugh. He had seen that ad once and it was a plastic grandfather chanting "I'm not your daddy, I'm your grandfather" and it said that maybe four times, and since he heard that, he sings it all over the house. In conclusion, laughing is the best way to feel better about anything. So @ CAPS1 ton bleu is just thinking of something that will always make you laugh and laugh.

      Well, since you want to hear a funny story, I have a few but I'm only going to tell you about one of them. This one starts in my @ DATE1. I lived at @ LOCATION1 and it is quite warm at @ DATE1. I lived there for a few summers @ CAPS1 I know how hot it is. This @ DATE1, I wanted to have a pool for fun and keep cool. But I didn't want a pool that I could just hang out in. I wanted a really nice pool for everyone. I already knew this stuff cost a lot of money, but I wanted to have a big pool @ CAPS1 I could bring all my friends over, hang out, swim and play my favorite mar-co polo game. I went to talk to my dad about my pool idea. He said "he would love to have a pool for @ DATE1" because he would come swim with me and hang out but like I said @ CAPS2 is expensive and @ NUM1 exactly what my dad said. I told him I would pay half of what it cost. My dad finally agreed with me @ CAPS1, we go down to Walmart and watch the pools. There were small cheap and there were a lot of huge expensive ones, but I was looking for one right in the middle, not too small and not too expensive. I found one for eight hundred which was perfect for what I wanted. I went to ask my dad if I could have this one. He said "if I paid four hundred dollars like the original deal, I could get it." Like I told him @ NUM1 what I said I was going to do and @ NUM1 what I had to do ". To make a plan to get four hundred dollars my dad was doing the same, but he has a job @ CAPS1 it's not that hard for him because he gets paid. @ NUM4 much harder for me because I don't have a job. @ CAPS1 I decided to fix my bike and go get it all available jobs. I went door to door to find people who needed help around the house. I found a few people who needed to do certain things and @ CAPS2 both agreed to pay me fifty dollars, @ CAPS1 on each, I could get a hundred right off the bat. Had to haul around a bunch of old tree branches and trash. When I was done I put that money in my savings for later. I also went to this place called @ ORGANIZATION1 and was good friends with one of the kids who were related to them. told him about him asking if I could do a job for some money. @ CAPS2 said "I could go to each tree and put a pink tag on it and @ CAPS2 agreed to give me eighty-five dollars. I made a deal but my bike can't go and dump the mud there where the trees were planted. My friend told me that “I could haul his little mountain bike fifty and take it to put these tags on the trees.” @ CAPS1 I borrowed it and got these Eighty-five dollars. I gave my friend ten because he let me borrow his mountain bike. I'm almost halfway through my four cents. When I thought about it, @ CAPS1 s started buying this pool that I forgot my birthday was coming tomorrow. I told my dad I wanted this pool for my birthday and @ NUM5 like "yes I already knew @ CAPS1 I got it have already bought ". I was @ CAPS1 happy to have my pool. Now I have about two hundred dollars to spend and didn't know what to buy. @ CAPS1 I bought a bunch of food and stuff for the pool party. On my birthday, I invited a group of friends over to my house. We all went to the pool, even the parents. We decided to play mar-co polo. Because I wanted to play. My friend @ PERSON1 @ NUM6 daddy who is a huge guy was playing. I said mar-co and he threw himself on me. I moved but he continued he went straight against the wall of my pool and everyone fell from the pool. I was laughing out loud @ CAPS1 but I was also upset because my pool is already broken. Fortunately @ PERSON1 @ NUM6 daddy is rich, @ CAPS1 he bought me another pool. He saw how crushed I was on my birthday and because he knew I wanted that pool. He also bought me a new bike and he was sick. During @ DATE1 I had a blast in my pool and if I wasn't in my pool I was on my new bike.

@ CAPS4- @ CAPS1 Laughs @ CAPS2 a @ CAPS3 I can't imagine where my life would be right now without laughing, who my friends would be, or @ CAPS1 I would spend my day. Laughter is what created what has been one of the most important relationships in my life so far. Laughter is what unifies us, it gives us each something in common despite our differences. This has proven to be true in my life, especially with one person, @ CAPS4. I met @ CAPS4 a year ago in one of my classes, we never really talked nor knew until one day she @ CAPS2 made me laugh. It was just another day in class doing a lab when I see this red haired little girl twitching on a bar stole, of course I immediately laugh. This girl was squirming on a stole doing awkward hand gestures and laughing, cracking me up, and not a single other person thinks that funny, they just give us the "girls, you are crazy" look. Others ask what she is doing, @ CAPS4 too hysterical to form actual words, I say "hello guys, this is a dinosaur like from @ CAPS7 the @ CAPS8, 'I have a tender head and little arms .... I don't think this plan was very well thought out well .... '"@ CAPS4 reply with a point to me and a nod, I knew that was the start of a beautiful laugh filled, @ CAPS3. There are countless times laughter has been the centerpiece of my time with @ CAPS4. When we hang out, it seems like we effortlessly poke fun at not only ourselves but others as well, even complete strangers. The best example I can give is when we were at @ ORGANIZATION1, a hotel with an indoor water park, for my birthday with two of our best friends. Our time there had already been full of laughs, photos and good times, but when we were all dressed up and you were looking for something to do it was the highlight of @ TIME1. Two sleepless nights, lots of sugar and energy drinks @ CAPS2 our crazier little foursome than usual, giving @ CAPS4 the courage to stroll over to a very attractive stranger and make him say hello to the girl in the house. birthday, me. @ CAPS4 and I start to move and fall to the floor laughing, at this point most people would think these @ NUM1 girls are weird, I'm leaving now, but this guy was entertained by our laughter even though he was is joined to us Laughter. Perhaps the best memory of @ CAPS4's infectious laughter was when we went to see @ CAPS1 at @ CAPS14 your @ CAPS15, trust me when I say tonight could easily have gone down very quickly. Basically @ CAPS4 was screaming on the movie, cracking, joking, texting, making us laugh, so all the things that get you kicked out of a movie and make people around you angry. But for some reason people around us ate his humor and found him hilarious, they were laughing with us. It was one of the best nights at the movies I have ever had, I have never experienced such an adventure. The way that laughter has impacted my life is by giving me this amazing best friend who is crazy and full of humor. @ CAPS4 is one of those people who makes you realize that laughter is what unifies us and is something to do. So go ahead, act like your @ NUM2 even if your @ NUM3, you never know who is making you laugh @ MONTH1 and what friends you might make. "

 My sister @ PERSON3 and my niece @ PERSON2 had just come down from @ LOCATION2. It had been three years since I had seen them. When my brother @ PERSON1, my sister @ CAPS1 and I went to my fathers house for the weekend, we all decided to go camping by the beach. That morning we all woke up early and packed everything in the car. My dad and brother did most of the work while we girls were getting ready. After everything was packed we went to @ LOCATION1. @ LOCATION1 is a small town surrounded by mountains with absolutely nothing but a few houses, a park, a river and forests all around you. My dad built a little one-room cabin there a few summers ago. There was a wood stove in one corner, bunk beds filling almost half the cabin, and an always messy counter with all the food and supplies we brought. During the whole ride we were all playing with each other giving each other horse bits, claws and pulling on each other's seat belts so that they tightened on the chest. We were also telling @ PERSON3 funny stories about each other trying to embarrass them. When we got to the gravel road my dad started backing up the car and leaving a fourth scar @ CAPS1. While everyone was laughing about it, she was screaming. This @ TIME1, we all decided to go to bed early so we could wake up and get ready to hit the beach before noon. @ CAPS1 was the only one who really wanted to fall asleep. Everyone except @ CAPS1 was trying to laugh at the rest of @ TIME1. While everyone was taking @ CAPS1 they were yelling at them to go to sleep and calm down. @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON1 started shouting random stuff just to drive her crazy. When everything was quiet one of them was shouting something like, it's not too late to sleep like a baby @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6. @ CAPS1 would start screaming as everyone burst out laughing. That @ TIME1 was one of the funniest nights there. It was all hilarious this @ TIME1 but when you look at it now it wasn't that funny, it was just stupid. I think we made the most of @ TIME1 as much as we could. It has become one of my most vivid memories. We all look back and laugh.

 Laughter is almost always a good thing, mainly because when people laugh it means that they are happy or that something is funny. It can be very beneficial at times like when someone is not feeling happy, people always try to make them laugh to make them feel better. When I'm in front of someone I don't know, my first instinct is usually to try to make them laugh. laughter has always been a source of pleasure and it still is today. We have certain advantages now than a hundred years ago. For example now @ CAPS2 we want to laugh, we just have to take the remote control and turn on the @ CAPS1, we can even choose what we want to laugh at and we even have the option to go and get something to laugh on the the Internet. Sometimes people go to comedy clubs to see stand up comedians. Comedy and laughter go hand in hand, from the first time someone laughed, comedy was born and will be there forever unless being happy becomes forbidden. I remember every time my parents had a new friend the only thing I heard when they were at my house was the laughter of my parents and our new guest. Soon the new guest was present much more often. Laughter is also a very important part of any relationship because it makes the person who makes the other laugh more a pleasure to be around and therefore sometimes makes them love them more, @ CAPS2 you have already noticed that men usually try to make them. women laugh to try to make love this member of the opposite sex. This and the accompaniment of physical attraction help to start the relationship. I have herds but I'm not sure laughter can be therapeutic too, sometimes I like to laugh when I'm not feeling so good so that @ MONTH1 maybe therapeutic for me. @ CAPS2 this is how people have been in therapy for many years. Sometimes people laugh, even @ CAPS2, the subject is not funny, they only do this because otherwise the situation would be a bit awkward and we might fall a bit out of place. Everyone has a different laugh, some are louder than others and some have a type of rhythm, my mom has a really loud high-pitched laugh and my grandpa has a low, hoarse laugh no matter what it's like your laughter it can help you feel better it can also help you get closer to someone. Laughing is just one of the greatest pleasures in life and we should all take the opportunity to sit down and laugh.

Library @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 after the @ DATE1 instead of sitting at home doing nothing I decided to volunteer at the library. Some @ MONTH1 say that a library is not a funny place but for my best friend @ PERSON1 and I it was full of many humorous adventures. There was the time with the creepy, stalker guy we love to call @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4, the time we decided to be super spies, and the different people who decided we were too loud and weren't too kind to tell us. We've worked hard in this library, but who says you can't have a little laugh at work? @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 by definition that means he's someone who loves @ CAPS3, but the @ CAPS2 guy was just too funny. One day @ PERSON1 and I had just finished work and were waiting for her grandmother to pick us up, when a weird guy sits down and starts looking @ ORGANIZATION1 like he knows her. He then asked us countless questions such as "@ CAPS6 your names?" and “@ CAPS7, do you have boyfriends?”. Being me, I didn't say a word and let @ PERSON1 speak the whole time. He kept telling us how beautiful we were which made us laugh even more because @ CAPS2's situation was getting more and more weird. Since his nickname is @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4, you can only guess @ CAPS6 that he asked us next. Oh yes he asked us if we wanted to start an @ CAPS3 line in the middle of the library. Luckily @ PERSON1's grandmother arrived just in time to save us and we only saw the @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 once or twice after that, as he moved soon after meeting @ CAPS2 . Being a spy was one of the hardest and funniest things @ PERSON1 and I have ever done in the library. It all started when we noticed @ CAPS2 a cute guy sitting all alone at a table that we could clearly see through book shelves not so far away. Being the adventurous type, I convinced @ PERSON1 to let me use his iPhone to take pictures of @ CAPS2 without his knowledge. Now some people would think it was a bit like a stalker, I just saw a chance to hone my spy skills. After I managed to get a few undetected images I decided to get one more before heading back to the other side of the library to see @ CAPS6 we had. I was about to take the picture when I met the eyes of the guy who wasn't supposed to see me. We then had to abandon the mission and crawl to the other side of the library so that he couldn't see us anymore, so he couldn't ask us why we were photographing him. The funny thing is the photos weren't that good and it shows how bad a spy we actually were. Normally, libraries are silent, aren't they ? Well @ PERSON1 and I had a little problem with people wanting the library to be silent. On one such occasion, a pretty middle-aged woman was doing her homework at a table not too far from where we were sitting. We were watching videos on @ ORGANIZATION1's iPhone and the speakers were low. @ The CAPS2 lady told us very rudely that she wanted to move somewhere else if we had to turn up the volume because she needed to do her job. Not a single thank you or thank you was said as we walked away. On a similar occasion, an elderly lady who was sitting a few shelves of books also asked us to be quiet so that she could finish her book. @ CAPS 2 times the old lady used her good manners, but she had a very rude tone of voice. On both occasions @ PERSON1 and I started laughing soon after. @ CAPS2 shows how "nice" people can be when they want to do something. Overall @ DATE1 has been one of the funniest summers I have ever had. Whether we got to speak with a guy who wanted to start a @ CAPS3 line or got caught spying on a cute guy or even got chastised by not-so-nice people we could always find @ CAPS1 somewhere. Not many people could say that the library has ever been a place where they laughed so hard they almost peed there, but @ PERSON1 and I can.

                                Coleslaw "@ CAPS1 get out of here before they wake up @ CAPS2." @ PERSON2 said, standing with her blanket wrapped around her. I did the same, brushing the grass off my pillow. Disappointment washed over me, I actually wanted to see the meteor shower. "@ CAPS3 coming soon @ PERSON5 ?" I asked, looking at my old friend in a new light. "@ CAPS4 !" @ CAPS14 told me and gave me a look of pure anger. We were all supposed to be in bed by ten, it was @ NUM1 am. It was week 5 at @ CAPS5 @ CAPS6. We made new friends and met new people. @ PERSON2 and I were @ CAPS15 for helping disabled kids and @ PERSON5 was @ CAPS15 for hitting all the cute guys who worked @ CAPS15 all @ DATE1. As @ PERSON2 and I walked @ CAPS9 to @ LOCATION1's motorhome to return his sleeping bags, I couldn't help @ CAPS16 from feeling angry. This was the third time @ PERSON5 had been rude to me @ DATE2 and I couldn't understand what his problem was. It could have been jealousy, @ CAPS16 @ PERSON5 didn't like @ PERSON3. My mind was going thousands of miles per minute and I knew it would be @ TIME1. We reached @ LOCATION1's trailer and opened the creaking door. @ CAPS15 @ CAPS14 was lying on the sofa in my pajamas. His daughter, @ PERSON1, well hidden in her bed. "@ CAPS7 girls !" @ CAPS14 exclaimed, "@ CAPS8's @ PERSON5?" “@ CAPS9 in the field watching the shower with his real friends,” I said, doing aerial quotes with my fingers. @ PERSON2 rolled her eyes and grabbed her pillow and blankets. "@ CAPS10 ! @ PERSON4, can we sleep here tonight ?" "@ CAPS11 !" @ PERSON4 said: "@ CAPS12 come in and lock the door behind @ CAPS3." We entered the trailer and locked the door. As we collapsed onto the beds, @ PERSON4 made chocolate milk. "@ CAPS13, ladies !" @ PERSON4 started by handing each of us a glass full to the brim of delicious milk : "I want to know the good gossip ! Why is everyone mad at @ ORGANIZATION1 ?" "@ CAPS14 is mad at me because your daughter loves me more." @ PERSON2 said, shrugging his shoulders and taking a long sip from his glass. "@ CAPS15 that's it." I said, "@ CAPS16 the other part is a long story. So yesterday I was telling him about @ PERSON3. @ CAPS3 knows the cute guy @ PERSON3?" they nodded, "@ CAPS17 I told him about a conversation @ CAPS20 and I had @ CAPS8 I told a stupid joke @ CAPS18 and please @ CAPS20 laughed and said 'that's cool 'I was @ CAPS18 excited and @ CAPS14 was laughing at me because I was jumping up and down. " "It doesn't sound mean." @ PERSON2 said. "@ CAPS19! @ CAPS14 then told me that @ PERSON3 doesn't love me and never will. @ CAPS14 said @ CAPS20 just thinks I'm stupid and pities me." I was almost screaming, "I mean out loud I was okay with her @ CAPS16 in my head I was screaming furiously @ CAPS20 love me! We're gonna get married someday !! J ' decoded his words with my heart !! " I slammed my palm against my chest and pretended to cry. Then I couldn't help but laugh @ CAPS16. We all three laughed hysterically at my fake passion. "@ CAPS3 should correct the skits for @ CAPS22 !" @ PERSON4 said, gasping between bursts of laughter. Suddenly @ PERSON2 stopped laughing and said, "I @ CAPS18 want coleslaw ! Random @ CAPS23 !" “I could go get coleslaw right away. @ PERSON4 shrugged his shoulders. "I could go get some @ PERSON3-slaw right now!" I say smiling. Instantly another laugh erupted from everyone. I thought about how much humor this story would lose every time I told it in the future. Somehow I knew I couldn't do him the justice he deserved. Laughter began to set in. We sip our milk quietly, thinking. While we were doing this I looked out the window to see @ PERSON5 walking across the field. With a groan, I got up to unlock the door. "@ CAPS24 that!" @ PERSON4 said, "and turn off the light. Anyone who hates my @ NUM2 year old daughter doesn't need to be here." I turned off the light and walked over to the bed @ CAPS9. @ PERSON5 came to the door and tried the handle. When @ CAPS14 found out it was locked, @ CAPS14 quietly knocked on the door. Then @ CAPS14 waited. We tucked our faces into pillows to stifle our uncontrollable laughter. Giving up, @ CAPS14 moved away into the gravel. We all burst out laughing, unable to control ourselves. Looking at the clock, @ PERSON4 gasped, it was @ NUM2 in the morning and @ CAPS5 would start in @ NUM4 hours. It was time to get some sleep. @ PERSON4 went @ CAPS9 in bed while @ PERSON2 and I said good night and turned around. The trailer fell silent. Pose @ CAPS15 I thought about the happiness created by us. I knew @ ORGANIZATION1 would be @ CAPS25. @ CAPS16 that she was crazy was worth what I learned. That @ TIME1 I found out that if your happiness drives someone crazy, it's @ CAPS15's fault. Be happy and enjoy life! Anger arises from the joy of others. So why not be @ CAPS26? It beats the alternative, doesn't it?

 It was in the middle of @ DATE1 and I was ten years old, bored and sleeping constantly. Even at ten, I was still playing with toys, and that was the highlight of most days. All of my fifth grade friends were on vacation surfing @ LOCATION1 or roasting marshmallows over the log fire with their families at camp, while I was stuck at home doing nothing. It was about to be the most boring @ DATE1 break no one had ever had until @ DATE3. The day I met @ PERSON1 was the day I won my best friend. I met @ PERSON1 because of my brother and sister they had a crush on each other and wanted to start dating. It was fine with our parents, but it also meant that his brother @ PERSON1 and I also had to go with us. I remember the first day being so uncomfortable and stiff. I could tell he didn't like me, he only laughed when I made a joke here and there. Over time, I must have grown in him because a few days later he was laughing at pretty much every joke I made. These jokes had ultimately led to a friendship that would last a lifetime. What really started when her birthday came at the end of @ DATE2. He was having a little birthday party with me, his family and his good friend @ CAPS1. @ CAPS1 couldn't get through the night so it was just me and @ PERSON1. I didn't get much sleep that night, but it was fine with me because why I hadn't slept was reason enough not to. We spent half the night talking, laughing, and really getting to know each other better. Anyone with eyes could see that we were becoming close friends. Even after our siblings broke up, we still hung out like the two of us. The real test of our friendship came shortly after his birthday when @ PERSON1 and his family moved to @ LOCATION2, where they were from. After their move, I was still in contact with him and we spoke to each other frequently. They had been gone for about a year when I got a call from @ PERSON1 telling me they were coming back. I had so many questions to answer, but he had a really bad connection and the call was dropped quickly after I heard him say that. With a lot of things left unsaid, my overall emotion was obviously happy, but also slightly muddled. Was he really coming back? This is the question that made me ask myself the question. It was a few days later that I got another call from him, and this time we actually got a chance to talk. It was true, he was coming back, but it turns out it's not forever. @ PERSON1 has been back for about another solid @ NUM1 years, having fun and being best of friends, but his parents already wanted to come back to @ LOCATION2. This time it was different because he wasn't coming back. He was going to stay there, without thinking of going back. @ PERSON1 had left my life as quickly as he had entered. He's now across the country, with new friends and a renewed life, probably laughing at a new friend's jokes.

 Laughter can be a good idea and sometimes it can be a sad thing. When my family and I went to @ LOCATION3, we went to meet my two little brothers. We left a bit early so we could take a vacation. When we got to where we were going, we rode a fairy to an island at @ LOCATION1. On the way my sister @ PERSON1 acted like she was on the titanic, she had the dress and everything. My brothers, my dad and I couldn't stop laughing at her because she is eighteen. @ CAPS5 while we were staying there we were with our uncles and they have a little dog and she was running away from him and she fell so hard and my family and I weren't trying to laugh at her but she is a little difficult. After we went to lunch with our uncle and aunt we went to the military base @ PERSON1 didn't want to keep hands away from jets here. What my family and I found so funny is that @ PERSON1 is eighteen and the rest of us are fourteen or under, so I guess we just like to choose @ LOCATION2. When we went to @ LOCATION3 it was the day before the boy's date and we are family and we went to @ LOCATION3's underground tour. Well, after all of that was over we went to the gift shop that opens at the end of the tour. @ PERSON1 buys a pin that says something wrong and after buying it @ CAPS4 saw it, she threw it out because she doesn't like that stuff but @ PERSON1 got out of the trash . After that we all got hungry so we went to this place where they were selling really tacos @ CAPS1 and we got an order and we had a nice sit we also had sodas and my other sister and I have took a bite of food and had a drink of food @ CAPS5 @ PERSON1 said "oh my gosh there are two really hot guys right there" @ CAPS5 sierra takes the biggest sip of tapattao and I don't remember that that @ PERSON1 said but she said something and it got me and sierra laughs out loud and we spit food all over the place @ LOCATION2 she gets up and screams. So of course parents and family don't want to be there anymore because we embarrassed them so we all started walking to the car and just when uncle @ PERSON3 yelled @ PERSON1 don't fall because that is where I fell all you hear our sister falling behind us, it was so funny. What made it even funnier was that sierra and I just started to stop laughing and oh my god we laughed the whole way to the car. Are all the way home @ PERSON1 was mad at us because we always laughed at her but we went to the beach she was on it. I think when we went to the beach this was where we started to bond a lot more because we were all playing without cell phones, lots of climbing pictures it was fun we had left @ PERSON1 and my brother @ CAPS2 behind a few times @ CAPS5 @ PERSON2 tried to keep throwing me into the water so that I would push him back @ CAPS5 @ PERSON2 threw a rock at @ LOCATION2 and it fell. When we all took a photo on a @ CAPS1 newspaper we all shook it and @ PERSON1 sierra and I all fell down and injured my arm so we had to go to the doctor. A month after we got home, @ CAPS4 took @ PERSON1, sierra, aunt @ PERSON4 and me to @ CAPS3 on ice and it was probably the best time of my life. Are @ CAPS4 says "I don't know what's funniest @ PERSON1 greeting the actors on the mirror who can't see her in the dark or on stage." @ CAPS5 is the aunt who said "yes thank you @ CAPS6 for making me sit next to her." @ CAPS5 when the cartoon toy story came to the sierra and I said "look @ PERSON1 what are you doing on the rink and she thought we were talking about the pig and we weren't all the little troll and @ CAPS4 and aunt @ PERSON4 just burst out laughing it was hilarious. When we got home we were all talking about it and laughing and she got mad because she always laughed at her because she is small but when it comes to us she thinks its so funny.There is a lot of laughs in our family and I can't wait to have more so that when I grow up I will have alot of great memories beside me and i will always look back as i am now and say wow what good times i have had since i was grown up. when we are as a family we laugh together i think this is the moment when we actually communicate

 I have a friend and her name is @ PERSON1. I've known her since we were both in fifth grade and in the same grade. We've been friends for about five to six years now and it's been a great friendship. About two years ago, for her 15th birthday, she invited a few friends and I over to spend the day with her dad at @ LOCATION1. The plan was to go out, have fun, and do pretty much whatever we wanted to do because it was her birthday. There was a pool for swimming and a flatscreen TV for watching movies, plenty of board games, and quite a few people to have a conversation with. On the morning of @ DATE1, we all loaded the car around noon and headed to his father's apartment at @ LOCATION1. A short @ NUM1 minute later we had arrived at the apartment complex. We were all so excited to spend the whole day having an amazing slumber party for @ ORGANIZATION1's birthday. The second the van had pulled over the five people in the car, including me, we unbuckled our seat belts as fast as we could and got up from the seats and headed for the house. Everyone had gone there with their seat belts unfastened, except for friend @ CAPS4 @ PERSON2. She thought she heard and felt the seat belt button click to release it, but it never disengaged. While the seat belt was still fastened, she attempted to jump out of her seat, but at the last second the seat belt grabbed her by the trash and pulled her back to her place. She had laid there, her arms at her sides, her head back against the headrest and moaned for a good ten seconds. It was one of the many laughs that had occurred that day. A good two hours had passed and the five of us were relaxing in the living room and discussing what to do next. @ PERSON1 had suggested "@ CAPS1, guys, we should all go pool for a few hours, swim and sunbathe." The rest of us all agreed, considering it was probably a hundred degrees outside, the weather was super sunny and clear, and because it was @ CAPS2 @ PERSON1's birthday, and she should be able to do whatever she wants. Then, after the conversation, we all put on our swimsuits, got our towels and whatever else we needed for the pool, and headed for the door. We didn't know it, but the asphalt outside was boiling ! Of course we were all barefoot as we were just going to jump in the pool anyway. We all stepped on the asphalt, and all you could do here was scream and scream. "@ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 ! @ CAPS4 the feet are on fire !" @ PERSON2 noticed. We all agreed with her at that precise moment. As the asphalt was outrageously hot, @ PERSON2 started running towards the grass which was about two hundred feet away. I would say thirty seconds later @ PERSON2 had finally hit the grass and all we heard was. "@ CAPS6 !" we all looked @ LOCATION2. She was lying on her back because the sprinklers had been turned on recently and she didn't know it, so her feet flew right in front of her and landed on her back. We all started to laugh but to run at the same time. I helped @ PERSON2 get up from the floor and then we all continued our journey to the pool. I think you can guess something else funny has happened with @ PERSON2.

                                  "@ CAPS1 @ DATE1" @ CAPS2 my brother graduated @ CAPS1 year it was a good time in our lives. We all had fun everyday because it was like my brother had run out of periods which made him so much more fun. At the start of @ DATE1 my brother and I went fishing almost daily with our friends. It was great fun for all of us. We were all able to hang out and stay connected as there is nothing else to do in our small town other than go to the lake and bass fish. @ CAPS2, he graduated, all relatives of the family gave him gifts like money or presents. My mother couldn't decide what to give him, though. @ CAPS2 she would always see us going up to the lake to fish for bass she had an idea she would send my brother and some of his friends on a fishing trip. My brother was very excited to have his plan here. They spent many hours looking for a place where he and his friends could go. They decided to go into the deserts of @ LOCATION1 to a huge lake to camp. I myself thought it was a very cool plan and I was happy for my brother. I didn't know my brother was planning to take me with him. He told me his plans on which he would take a few weeks before it was time to leave. I was so excited! My brother said we would take our friend @ PERSON1 on a trip with us which was cool because he's a fun person to be around. He was so happy @ CAPS2 that we told him he was going because he loves bass fishing more than we do. Immediately @ PERSON1 ran to the garage to get their camping and fishing gear ready for the trip, just as we @ CAPS2 got home that night. Two weeks later we all left on a two week trip to the eastern deserts of @ ORGANIZATION1. The first day we were in the east of @ ORGANIZATION1 before we even found where we were going to stay, we went fishing in a huge reservoir. @ PERSON1 almost caught a huge @ NUM1 inch bass, but the line on his rod snapped. My brother and I laughed at him and he was crazy. We spent the first night on the side of the road in the almost freezing air of @ LOCATION1 as we had accidentally left a day earlier and our camp view was busy in the campground. We were unhappy back then, but now we look back on that night with big laughs. The following days passed with great pleasure. We met some collage students from @ ORGANIZATION1 they were really cool people we all joined around the campfire and told some jokes. We laughed for probably half an hour @ CAPS2, one of the guys told us about some fun collage things that had happened. @ CAPS1 @ DATE1 was a very interesting @ DATE1 that was full of laughter and joy.

 Laughter, one of the happiest things to experience in this world. Anyone can relate to this and there is no one who would say they don't like to laugh. It is human nature to want and need to be connected with other people; we are social beings and laughter is the best way to connect with others. There's no negativity in laughing unless you're laughing at a rude comment, and in general, if people laugh, they'll say they're having a good time. People build relationships around experiences they have with other people, such as dating. On a first date, it is normal, and important, for both people to have fun and laugh. Otherwise, when they go their separate ways and all their thoughts are left, their impression could make or break the relationship. This is why a first impression is so important. When both people remember the date they just had, if they remember smiling and laughing, then they will most likely have a positive memory of their experience and want to go out again. Think about any experience you have ever had with another person. If you can remember the first time you met them and how it felt afterwards, what you felt at that point might tell you a lot about how the relationship went. Meeting new people is hard, but you ask someone how to start a conversation with someone new, and they'll usually say ' make them laugh '. It's a universal term, anyone can do it. The basketball season started last month and I play for a completely different team than last year. Only half of the girls on my team last year are still here, and I had to make a connection with girls who are younger than me, and who I haven't gotten to know yet. I start to think about all the new girls I've bonded with and how I'm now good friends with most of them because of the laughs. Every day we get closer and closer because we find ways to laugh with each other on the pitch. No matter how difficult the @ MONTH1 practice is, you can never exhaust yourself when someone makes you laugh. Laughter is necessary in life to make it more livable. Think about it. If you could never laugh again, what would be fun in life? Imagine life if it was like holding back all the time, never being able to let go, relax and have a good time. No one would want that. People would go crazy, laughter calms people down and softens them. It helps build people's personality and can affect others as well. Laughter is like a ripple in water, it starts off as one person and then develops into anyone nearby. Laughter is contagious, like an @ CAPS1 in the middle of @ DATE1, and brings joy to you and those you can reach. Laughter is the foundation of happiness.

   @ LOCATION3 has always been my go-to place whenever my parents ask me where I would like to go during @ DATE1. The lush green hills, breathtaking sunsets and thrilling thunderstorms are certainly a big part of my reason for leaving, but the thought of seeing my family's side @ CAPS7 again trumps all my other reasons. The heart of my @ LOCATION3 family has always been my @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 ; with her friendly smile, caring personality and keen sense of humor, she makes friends and acquaintances wherever she goes. Yet due to the fact that we live hundreds of miles apart, I can only see @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 three times a year : my family visits their house twice every @ DATE1, and she goes to my grandparents. for a few weeks at @ DATE2. I treasure every moment I spend with her, especially when she accidentally laughs at herself and causes a nervous breakdown. A few summers ago, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, my @ CAPS7 and I traveled to @ LOCATION2 to check out some of the city's antique and flower shops before dinner. We had spent a few hours driving around town, looking for all those stores to loot them of all the gems that @ CAPS7 or @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 must have had for their already old fashioned homes. I had lost all interest after the first few hours; antique shopping has never been a passion of mine, and I was willing to make the hour-long trip to @ LOCATION1 to go swimming with my cousins. After @ CAPS7 and @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 spent most of their money on a few " treasures " a few hours later, we were exhausted and ready to head home when we stumbled upon a pizzeria on the main drag . We got our mouths watering at the thought of having a slice, but rather than going to eat inside, we ordered a pizza to take home and bake instead. In her white @ ORGANIZATION2 van, my @ CAPS1 pulled into the store parking lot, leaving @ CAPS7 and I inside as she grabbed the pizza. When she returned a few minutes later, the aroma of pizza wafted around the cab, making our mouths water and our urge to come home grew exponentially. @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 put the pizza in the back seat, grabbed his coffee and cranked the engine. We were all lost in our own thoughts about the possibility of squeezing a slice of pizza when suddenly the front tires of the pickup dipped and hit the road. @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 almost dropped his hot coffee on his lap, while @ CAPS7 panicked and grabbed the door handle reflexively. We were all stunned, stunned like little children trying to figure out that @ ORGANIZATION1 didn't exist. Moments after the initial panic we realized that @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 had accidentally rolled onto the sidewalk. We burst out laughing as poor @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 had a red rose face and a larger apologetic smile than @ ORGANIZATION3. She drove carefully with the traffic, laughing hysterically with tears in her navy blue eyes with @ CAPS7 and me. Our episode of hysteria lasted a few minutes, during which @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 parked in a vacant parking lot; neither of us wanted another unplanned adventure down the road. I wiped the tears from my eyes, trying to stifle the laughter and pull myself together. @ CAPS7 was still laughing and wiping the mascara off her face. @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 did the same, then turned to look at me. She locked her bright eyes into mine and smiled as sweetly as she could, and we broke into more hysteria. After @ CAPS28's next hysterical little episode ended, we were finally able to retreat to the streets with the rest of civilization. As @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 cautiously exited, I burst out, "@ CAPS27 not to run over sidewalks!" @ CAPS28 elicited another set of laughs. @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 has always been there for me, through laughter and tears. Because we are a family, we have a natural bond between us. Still, without laughing, the @ CAPS28 link wouldn't be as close and glued as it is now. Hundreds of kilometers of farmland and open roads separate us. Occasional phone calls and emails are all we have to communicate with each other. My @ CAPS1 is the most caring, humorous and loving person I have ever met, and unfortunately I can't spend as much time with her as I would like. But every time I see her, I smile and think about the funny stories we have between us. Without the humor and laughter we share, our bond wouldn't be as close as it is and we would both be ignorant of our current world of joy.

 "@ CAPS1 days are diamonds and @ CAPS1 days are stone" are the famous melodic words of @ LOCATION1. He was absolutely right and the day of @ DATE1 was a very difficult day. It started when I woke up late, having stayed awake until eleven the night before to finish my homework. As I hurriedly put a sweater on my head, I ran downstairs and out the door, to school. Current under clouds gray and dreary, I suddenly remembered the test geometry which was scheduled for today. In my seventh geometry class, the sleep deprivation was starting and my head was racing. Of course, that must have been the day @ PERSON1 decided to cheat my test. As his eyes scanned my paper for the third time, I sighed and stared intently at his own paper. I should have just moved around in my seat so he couldn't see my test, but I wanted him to understand the point. @ PERSON2, however, seemed to think I was cheating on @ PERSON1. I took the reprimands in silence and went to my locker. After collecting my things, I turned to go home. A loud tearing sound caught my attention and I realized, with a moan, that I had just torn my sweater on the corner of my locker. Without recognizing the looks of my peers, I turned and ran through the pouring rain. Once on my quiet road, I couldn't contain myself. With my face turned to the stone sky, I screamed until my throat was like sandpaper. I had never had an emotional breakdown before and the feeling was strange and foreign to me. I hoped no one would ever see me like this, for I had become a stranger, hurt and lost. After my outburst I slowly walked home and walked into the house to find my @ NUM1 year old sister, @ PERSON3, begging me for some macaroni and cheese. I sighed and put a pot of water on the stove. Maybe it was cruel fate or maybe just stupidity, but either way, I ended up with half a pot of steaming water spilled over the front of my body. Granted, it wasn't very hot, as I had just put it on the stove, but all I could do was sit on the cold kitchen floor, put my head in my hands, and cry. My sobs sounded like the croaking of a frog. I looked up suddenly, however, when I felt a small hand pat my shoulder. "@ CAPS2 ?" @ PERSON3 asked hesitantly. "@ CAPS3 did the dog tell the cat?" I just looked at her with streaming eyes. "@ CAPS4 is a cat-astrophe," she replied to herself. A small smile spread across her pink lips as she started to giggle. Then I started to laugh too which led to uncontrollable laughter. It was a ridiculously humorless joke, but the laughter was like cold water running over the painful burns the day had left me with. We sat there, a chuckling little girl and a messy, laughing teenager, sitting on their kitchen floor on a very gray day. A little joke, with just a burst of laughter, had turned my entirely stony day into a perfect little diamond.

 My dad and I went out to teach me how to drive after I recently got my license. I was nervous at first of course, but I quickly got comfortable behind the wheel. I drove all over town doing some errands that we needed to do along the way. Now was the time to go through the car wash, my first time in a car wash with me in control. I didn't think a car wash would be hard to do after driving around town, but I was wrong. After struggling to get myself to the right place for the washing to begin, I had to roll up all the windows and fold the side mirrors down. Before I could do all the washing had started! As a hurricane of soap swirled around the car, I rushed to fold up the side mirror and succeeded. Unfortunately, due to my slow reaction times, I was also unable to roll up my driver's window as the soap came back and enveloped me in white foam. My dad and I were all wet and the interior of the car was cleaned even though it wasn't planned at first. I finally rolled up my window and looked at my dad. He looked at me silently, the car was silent. After our spirits finally developed, we burst out laughing. We hadn't stopped laughing during the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of this situation. All I could say after that is people go there all their lives without having this kind of car wash incident so why must it have happened to me !

 You know when you talk to a friend and they tell a hilarious story about this time @ DATE1 when he spilled soda on the person next to them at the neighborhood barbecue, or tripped in front of an entire classroom full of people on the first day of school? And then you think it's so funny that you laugh so hard that you cry? I remember days like these, you always tend to feel better when you laugh. When friends hang out, laughter is usually the order of the day. In order to be able to joke with someone and be able to laugh, you usually need to be comfortable finding something funny. Laughter brings people together even in the worst days. Everyone has these tough times when you're talking to someone you don't have the best relationship with, but you still have to get your way and try to make it less embarrassing. There's also the random joke when someone is upset to try and lighten the mood. When you make someone laugh, it's a lot less embarrassing because then you know they're in a good mood and it's easier to talk with less tension. I had a lot of days where I had a fight with a friend and had to talk to them for class or they insisted on talking. It's like they keep talking or listening to you and you don't know what they are thinking or judging you while you are talking. But you know they aren't when you can make them laugh, because they don't really think badly of you. It also helps with blood pressure. There is also the moment when a friend of yours cries for something that makes you want to cheer them up or let them talk to you. Of course, there is always tension about them crying, but joking about it or trying to make them smile or laugh helps distract them and put them in a better mood. It is said that "laughter is the shortest distance between two people". and I think that's true because when you joke with someone, you learn more about them and they're more comfortable opening up to you. Also, if you can have a good laugh with someone, they are more likely to become a friend of yours because you know how to make them laugh and it's fun to talk with you. The more you and a friend can joke and laugh together, the more you tend to get closer to them because you enjoy spending time with them, you are more comfortable with them and you know them better. Also, when you can joke around with someone freely, you can usually talk to them freely about everything and you know that they will be there for you when you need a good joke or someone to talk to. I know I personally love to hear funny stories, I never really have many of my own that I remember. I love to hear jokes and laugh with my friends. It always brightens up your day to have a good laugh with someone you know. But most people also tend to laugh or smile when they're uncomfortable. You know those times when someone has an awkward conversation with you and asks a question that you don't want to answer or don't know how to answer and all you do is laugh and smile when they look at you while waiting to to respond. Or when you have to talk to someone you don't know and you laugh and keep messing up your sentences because you don't want to mess up. I'm not sure if laughing when you're uncomfortable is just a way to make it less embarrassing or because you don't know what else to do. Sometimes when you get embarrassed and laugh, it can make it even more embarrassing when they find it just weird and sometimes it helps when they joke with you or just keep the conversation going and make it less awkward. Even when you know someone, you can still have those awkward conversations or those moments of laughing so hard that you cry. It is also said that "Laughter is the best medicine". I also agree with this because when you laugh you always tend to be in a better mood and when you are in a better mood you tend to feel better in some way and you also tend to be in a better mood. be more positive about things. Laughter brings people together in awkward, sad, good, or just normal conversations. The better you get along with someone, the more you can joke together, the more comfortable you are with that person. Your day is always bright when you share a good laugh with a friend, classmate, parent, anyone, even a stranger. It always helps lighten your mood, even on the most stressful and depressing days.

 Have you ever had a memorable time, where you laughed so much with your friends or family? Well I know I have had several of those moments with my friends and family. I love those times when you laugh so hard that your stomach starts to hurt a lot. First of all, one of my last memorable laughing moments that I spent with my mom that I don't see often. So this moment meant a lot to me as you can imagine. The last time she came to see my older brother and I we went bowling. She also took her friend with her. My brother and I hadn't bowled for a very long time, but we knew we were going to beat them anyway. Turns out my mom did beat me though. We had a lot of laughs about it, in fact I think it was the first time that I wasn't a sore loser. While I'm still not sure how she beat me, she would cross the ball to the side and somehow go down the middle. When you have times like these, that you can look back to help you get through the tough times, it's really inspiring. Overall we had some great laughs that day which was shared with my mom. Another memorable moment of laughter was spent with my dad and my brother. Every now and then my dad, brother, and I sit in our living room and talk about several different things, some good and some bad. They can concern my mother, the school, our animals or our three compassion for sport. These chats always mean a lot to me because we never spend a lot of time together. We don't spend a lot of time together because my brother and I are still in school or in some sort of sport and my dad is still at work. These conversations have many effects on me, sometimes they are sad and other times they make me feel better. There are so many laughable moments right in our living room. One thing we always love to laugh about is the way my dad always says album. For some reason he thinks he needs to add another @ CAPS1 in front of @ CAPS2 to spell album. My brother and I love to laugh at him for it, but we all have our moments that we love to laugh at each other. It was just one of the many things we love to laugh about. Sometimes laughter is a very important part in someone's life. For someone who is on the alert or upset, just saying something to make them smile or laugh makes all the difference in the world. Laughter is a great way to make people feel loved and excepted, it's also a great way to get people back on track when they are depressed. I know that smiles and laughter make me feel so much better on the inside. Hope you had a good time laughing with the people you care about and love.

 In @ NUM1's @ DATE1 ', I spent two weeks with my aunt. At the time, my cousins lived with her. My cousins and I are very close so we like spending time together. In the evening we decided to watch a movie. I remember her name was my best friend's daughter. So we started to watch the movie and it was super funny, we laughed constantly throughout. My cousin named @ PERSON1 has an awesome laugh, every time he started to laugh I couldn't help but laugh too. We watched the movie and after we went to get some food. We were all in a great mood, making jokes and doing crazy things to make us laugh or be funny. My cousins were changing voice, then repeating lines more or less high film or simply inventing things. That night we ate @ ORGANIZATION1. When we got back to my aunt's place neither of us were tired so we decided to watch a late night show called @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. It was a program made up of a bunch of short cartoons. They were all very funny. We laughed at them, we laughed and we imitated what the characters were doing. We stopped to watch the @ @ NUM2 in TIME1, I was very tired but my cousins were not. For a while, we just sat on the sofas and talked, continuing to make jokes and say stupid things that would make us laugh. About an hour later we all fell asleep and continued to watch movies and hang out for the two weeks while I was there. It was probably the best moment of this @ DATE1. I was very happy and I enjoyed my @ DATE1 because of my two cousins and the time we spend together. I laughed so much that my stomach ached all the time, but I didn't care because I was happy. I still spend time with my cousins and I laugh a lot. I believe that our time spent together and our shared laughter has brought us closer and more involved in each other's lives. A person who can laugh, knows how to have fun and is pleasant to be around.

@ CAPS1 as long as you breathe, love as long as you live. @ CAPS2 was impossible, there was absolutely no way @ CAPS2 could be real. Breathing seemed almost impossible, as if I was choking on air. Everything around me scrambled, spinning viciously as I clung to the freshly cut grass. Tears diluted the sting in my eyes, but not the sting in my nose, although neither made my body shake like @ CAPS2 did. Attempts at screaming came out in the form of muffled moans. Alone @ CAPS8 helpless, I could feel her staring at me, not knowing what to do @ CAPS7. My best friend stood @ CAPS8 and watched me as I got more violent, pounding the dew-soaked lawn with my fists, moans turning to screams. A door slammed behind me @ CAPS8 I felt my father's arms trying to guide me home. Once inside, my father buried my face in his chest in an attempt to silence my obnoxious lamentations rather than comfort me. He apologized on several occasions, guess he didn't know what else at @ CAPS7. @ CAPS2 was too early for the "In a better place" speech, but too late for everything to be okay. I continued to cry as I stumbled down the stairs to my bedroom, @ PERSON2 behind me. Sitting on my bed, @ CAPS2 seemed like nothing was worse in the world. Suddenly, I was overwhelmed by the feeling that I was missing something, as if he was closer than I thought. I sat down to watch her plastic sunglasses staring at me from my dresser. A black frame with neon blue sides. He @ CAPS8 his "stunning hues" danced through my head. Him standing on the sunroof of the flexing car topless, only to straighten up while pretending to be awake in class. Seeing the glasses was like looking into his eyes. In my mind his face contained grief @ CAPS8 frustration he didn't want me to cry. The few times tears fell on my face he would say, "@ CAPS3 on, suck @ CAPS2 @ CAPS8 take @ CAPS2 like a man !" I knew in my heart that he wanted me to be with the people he loved @ CAPS8, he wanted us to smile. With the morning sun beating down on my b ack, I pedaled my bike as fast as my legs would allow. Upon reaching her porch, I immediately realized that the time I was about to spend in this house would be like never before. When I let myself in like I always have @ CAPS6 looked around the corner swollen eyes @ CAPS8 discolored. I took four steps forward @ CAPS8 met her with a tearful hug, in which I apprehended @ CAPS6 wanted me to be him. @ CAPS6 loved her in ways I had never imagined, but the desperate desire to be held by a loved one I knew all too well. We cried @ CAPS8 because we couldn't do anything @ CAPS7. When there was a pause in the sobbing, @ CAPS8 @ PERSON3 actually looked at me for the first time, noticing that I looked as horrible as @ CAPS6. I put my hand in my pocket @ CAPS8 took out his sunglasses. @ CAPS2 was hard not to be selfish in a time when all I wanted was comfort, but I knew what I had at @ CAPS7. Forcing a smile seemed infeasible, but I knew @ CAPS2 was my next step. His gaze fell on the palms of my hands. "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5." @ CAPS6 started crying again, I held her @ CAPS8 tried to be strong. More of my friends crept out of the kitchen, @ CAPS8's stained tears blushed as well. I smiled at them softly. They all noticed the sunglasses in my hand, but didn't understand, they didn't know him like I knew him @ CAPS6 @ CAPS8. We spent the day gathered with a waste of words @ CAPS8 hungry, our pizza was left untouched, the TV on just to break the silence. Nobody said much about anything. "@ CAPS7, do you remember the time he hid our biology project in the freezer?" I smelled the @ CAPS3 question like vomit, too big to swallow. They just looked at me, not knowing what to think. I was worried that I had spoken too soon, I started to assume that all of @ CAPS8's melancholy crying was supposed to continue uninterrupted longer than @ CAPS2. @ PERSON3 smiled @ CAPS8 nodded in relief. "@ CAPS8 you got mad because he kept putting nuts in your noodles." I laughed out loud, couldn't help @ CAPS2. I was inundated with the memory of him trying to act confused as to why the boiling water had cashews floating on top. "@ CAPS7, do you remember how he always braided your hair?" @ PERSON3 smiled even more. The rest of the month was tearful, but @ CAPS2 was bursting with laughter. When @ PERSON1 died laughing was the last thing I wanted @ CAPS7. @ PERSON1 always generated most of my laughter, @ CAPS8 with him gone, I never imagined I would do it again @ CAPS1. But actually, just because he left too early doesn't mean the laughter did. My bliss in his memory will never die. "

 Laughter in my life is one of the most important things because it is often the motivation that I need. Whether it's an embarrassing situation I laugh at thinking back, or when I feel angry and my best friend does something to make me crack. Sometimes I just feel sad, and if I'm with the right people, the ones who make me laugh, I know it won't last long. I know to clear my mind all I need is a few laughs here and there. Recently I started going to the gym. I have always been overweight and in poor shape, so the gym, like many other attempts, seemed to not last long. When I took the tour of my original gym with my mom, who suggested we try it, I was pretty excited. Of course, that was because it was something new, and I was motivated enough to want to start this day. My mom, being the most logical, and of course, the one who would pay monthly for membership, wanted to think and discuss it a bit more. In the end, my mom decided it was good for us. At first my mom kept me motivated. Because I was so out of shape, I got tired after five minutes on the elliptical, at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom next to me on the treadmill, working on it, and not even slowing down, kept me motivated. Just looking at her made me so happy that every once in a while I let out a brief burst of laughter, followed by a questioning look from her, but she laughed too. Sometimes I thought it was just because I was tired and a little delusional from the exertion, but looking back on it now I know I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something to do. to do together. The happy days at the gym were short-lived because as usual my mom was too tired and so on not to go. I vowed to myself to go there once I was able to drive myself regularly. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but something else bothered me; my car was a speed @ NUM1 and i only knew @ CAPS1 to drive in automatic. So after begging my mom almost every day to take me practice in my new car, she finally took me. In the dark parking lot of the church, the same one I started driving in automatic, more laughter between us started. She would make me close my eyes and "feel" where the clutch and throttle @ CAPS2 about halfway. At first I thought it was so absurd that I would start to crack and have my mom join in with her laughter. Once I finally got the hang of taking off, which is the hardest part for me, but, as always, the laughter was there to make it easier. I learned to drive quickly, and because I made that promise to myself, my first trip for myself was to the gym. My motivation back then was to finally be able to do something progressive just for myself, and the satisfaction was doing it on my own. The whole way to the gym, I sang @ PERSON1 in the deepest voice I could muster, which caused more laughter. The first few times I went to the gym were based purely on knowing that I was doing something right for myself. After about the fourth time, however, my motivation started to wane. Instead of listening to my iPod on the elliptical, I started watching "@ CAPS1 I @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4", because it made me laugh while I was still working my butt. Before I knew it the episode was over and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning @ NUM2 calories. I was so impressed with what I had accomplished that I felt like motivation was fully restored. I started going there again every day. In a week and a half, I had lost @ NUM3 pounds just by going to the gym, exercising and most importantly laughing. Part of it was personal motivation, but another part was the laughter that so easily distracted me from the task at hand. Because I was getting back in shape, I was also able to increase the "@ CAPS5" level on the machine and I still go there every day. Every day it gets easier and easier, and now I have "@ CAPS6" and "@ CAPS7 @ CAPS8" to make me laugh even more during my workout. I believe in many cases, laughter has saved me. Whether I was sad, angry, depressed, or in this case not motivated enough, it was always an option. Knowing that I have those giggles to look forward to at the end of the day keeps me in my car and going to the gym. I still lose weight and this is the first time in my life that I feel really energized. Laughter was a huge part.

                                                         Laughter and @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 Laughter is the key element in everything in life. @ CAPS2 is able to turn any sad moment for good and any great moment even greater. Here is an example where laughter brought my boyfriend and me together. I had a crush on the same guy, @ PERSON1, for two months. I was way too nervous to talk to him. One day my friends and I were walking down the hall he was in. When I saw him I tried to turn around and walk the other way, but my friends pulled me back. They then told me that they had heard from a "little bird" that he liked me too, so we continued to walk in his direction. We stopped walking right in front of him and my friends pushed me against him and then ran away. I told him sorry as I turned bright red. My best friends had set me up. We stood there for five minutes in awkward silence. All I did was look into her beautiful blue eyes. All I could think of was how sexy he looked in his black wrestling shirt and faded blue jeans. He probably thought I was a monster. He had leaned against the wall, mainly standing on his right leg. Then when he went to switch to his left leg, he let out the biggest fart I have ever heard. We started to laugh. After we calmed down from the hysterical laughter, we started talking. We ended up chatting for two hours. A few weeks had passed and we were talking more and more every day. Another week had passed and we went to our first movie. I called @ CAPS2 our first date. That night he asked me to be his girlfriend. I of course said yes. Since the day he farted, I thanked @ CAPS5 for @ CAPS2. I wouldn't have him as a boyfriend if @ CAPS2 wasn't for him to brake the ice with his awkward moment. I especially thank my friends for pushing me towards him that day. There couldn't be a better way to meet a guy. This is just one example of laughter and how much @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 changes or affects a situation. Laughter is the medicine for all medicines. @ CAPS2 is one of the most important tools for a @ CAPS3 person.

 Laughter is what I would like to call a "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 from @ CAPS3". Because no matter what language or what language you speak, when something funny happens, the natural reaction is to laugh. This reaction is present for everyone, and when it takes place; it's contagious and it helps bring everyone together. Laughter also gives off a feeling of happiness and joy, which in turn makes people freer and more open to participate and laugh too. In many cases, if there is an embarrassing situation at hand, laughter plays a big part in lightening the mood; and make the atmosphere a little more comfortable. At @ DATE1, laughter was the key to the success of our annual @ ORGANIZATION1. Our @ Organization1 consists of about @ NUM1 people (including cousins and a few close friends) ; as you can see @ MONTH1 is not easy to get to know and interact with everyone. However, at dinner time we like to change it up and sit next to relatives you wouldn't normally sit next to. At first it is usually very annoying, and sometimes even scary for the younger ones, when they end up sitting next to our very loud and opinionated aunts and uncles. That's until my @ LOCATION1 decides to make one of his hilarious jokes. My @ LOCATION1 is sort of a clumsy @ CAPS4. Not necessarily that he likes being in awkward situations, but rather that he likes to watch them play. Finally, halfway through the meal, after eating in almost total silence ; he decides to get up and give a little toast to @ ORGANIZATION1. After the speech, he always concludes with a well-prepared joke; which makes everyone laugh. Some cousins younger do not understand the pun. But what really keeps them going is listening to all of our aunts and uncles booing and yelling things like "@ CAPS5 @ CAPS6" and "@ CAPS7 help me" mixed with their obnoxious laughs. After all the fun has subsided, the awkwardness still seems to recede, leaving us with the feelings of happiness and joy that I described earlier. I believe these feelings correlate directly with lightening the mood and help make everyone more comfortable with who they find themselves sitting. Once all of these things have happened, the conversation turns and everyone ends up knowing a member of @ ORGANIZATION1, whom they might not have had the chance to really meet otherwise. Laughter is one of the keys to happiness in life; because without it, life would be very boring and boring. Laughter also has the power to change situations and make them better for the most part. At @ DATE1, laughter changed a situation in my life for the better, as it has done so many times since. In my eyes, laughter is the best @ CAPS2 of @ CAPS3 out there. If you really want to get to know someone, all you have to do is make them laugh!

 I choose to have a positive outlook on life and am generally a happy person. Who wants to go through life crazy all the time? Even at the bottom, I know I have something to be thankful for. For this reason, laughter is a daily factor in my life. When I'm with friends and family, I always laugh. Laughter is my medicine and I wouldn't be the same girl without it. When I was in fourth grade my family and I started going to a new @ CAPS3, didn't know anyone there and was really nervous about going to @ DATE1 @ TIME1. Mom took me down the stairs to the classroom and the teacher introduced herself to me. His name was @ PERSON1. She was pretty and very tall with a funny Australian accent. She wore alligator skin boots with black jeans and a pink top. Mrs @ PERSON1 introduced me to the class indicating my name and my rank. after taking my place, we recited @ CAPS1 against and read short excerpts from @ CAPS2 stories. When @ CAPS3 ended, mom came down to get me. As I was reluctant to see her, I took her hand, said goodbye to @ PERSON1, and walked upstairs without a word from the other kids, but going upstairs a girl about my age, from which I recognized from the class said goodbye to me. I returned his beautiful gesture with a smile and a wave. A week later mom took me downstairs to @ ORGANIZATION1. This time, I was relentless and determined to make a new friend. I went to sit next to the girl who said goodbye to me last week. I introduced myself to her and she told me her name was @ PERSON2. We quickly became very close. Every week I was so excited for @ CAPS3 that I could hang out with @ ORGANIZATION2. We have become best friends! We played together in the same football team and we pretty much live with each other. Actually @ PERSON2 has her own toothbrush in my house and I have one in her house too. Once @ PERSON2 and I were in @ CAPS3, and now that we're older we go to the main ward, we laughed so hard we almost peed our pants! @ PERSON2 and I have so many great memories together and even as we get older the memories will last forever.

          Making jokes or just talking about fun things and laughing with people can make conversations comfortable and allow people to see your real self. In my opinion. Laughter is one of the most important things you should have in a relationship with someone because you need to keep having fun and laughing at funny things. Laughing also makes you feel close to people because once you and that person get to know each other, you'll laugh at everything, even if it's not that funny. For example, when I meet people for the first time I'm very shy, I don't say a lot but if the person I'm talking to makes me laugh, it makes me feel comfortable and makes me want to joke with them, it makes conversation fun. If there is no laughter in a relationship, the relationship is practically dead. No one wants to be surrounded by someone who has no sense of humor. In my opinion, everyone has a funny side, some like to show it and some like to keep it to themselves. Some people can be funnier, but the point is, we can all be funny in our own way. I have had many experiences where laughter has benefited my relationship with people. My friend and I met in college, I was good friends with his sister but never really got to know him until I went to high school. I had a lot of lessons with him so I started talking to him, but since I already knew him, I wasn't very shy. The first day I spoke to him at school he was laughing at me but that wasn't to say that he was joking about the way I brought chocolates to his house and I didn't offer him chocolates, that is. was more of an insider's joke. The thing is, our relationship started with us laughing and joking. So I immediately felt that I could be myself with my new friend and not worry about what he would think. Now we're best friends, we laugh at everything, and we have our own little jokes inside. When I talk to my friend I can say whatever I think is funny and I know he will laugh at it. Laughter really made my friendship with my friend fun. One of the best relationships I have with a person is with my sister and that's because we laugh all the time when we're together. When one of us is going through a difficult time, we always find a way to make ourselves laugh and forget about all of our problems for a while. Even though we are sisters and naturally bond, laughter makes the bond of brotherhood ten times better. We have very similar personalities and we're both quite funny so the laughter never ends between us, there is always something to laugh about. Laughter in my opinion is very important to have in a relationship, without laughing it would be a miserable and unhappy relationship. Laughing brings out the good side in people in most cases, it brings out the truth in people. When you first meet people, laughing makes the conversation really comfortable and non-awkward. Starting a relationship with laughter can really make good friends, for example my friendship with my friend. When you are sad or angry it really makes you feel better when you have someone who makes you laugh it just makes you look better it can really change the mood of some people and make them forget the negative things of their lives for a while. Laughter is just a great way to bond with people. Having someone to laugh with is very important in life.

 When I was about thirteen, my older brother and I dissuaded going to spend the day fishing. I got out of bed that morning, put on an old pair of ripped jeans, and went downstairs to have breakfast. Along the way, I could smell the sweet scent of eggs and hash browns that made my mouth water. My brother was up and had just finished his plate. My mom handed me my plate and I grabbed the bottle of @ CAPS1. Ethan was sitting across from me as I ate and I said "We'll be leaving in about an hour." I said okay and continued to eat. After breakfast we gathered our sticks and tackle boxes and put them in the car with an old boat that we kind of stole from the old neighbor. We put our things in the van and Mom drove us into town. It was around eight in the morning, so we didn't get home until three or four in the afternoon, depending on the state of the fishing. There was a small store in town, and the stream ran right behind it. It was a small stream. I grew up with it, so I thought I knew what to expect. We sat behind the store and our mother left after telling us to be safe. It was a cool @ DATE1 morning and a little cloudy. The water was cold and my brother said I should carry his servers. I thought that was silly since we were in a boat. Burt, I put them on and we put the boat in the water. It was our first time using the boat so it was exciting. As we went down the stream the water got fast and loud and the embankment was like a wall with the outside world. As we took the next turn, it was there. A waterfall about as high as a man. Not the kind you would see in the movies but it was good enough for our eyes. Right in the middle was a large boulder and water circled around it on both sides. We pushed the boulder up and we were all thrown off the boat and grabbed the boulder for life. We were stuck and I looked at my brother and he kneaded as if to say it was the only way. So with that being said, we both let go and let the water have us. As soon as we let go it was like being on the back of a two thousand pound animal in a rodeo that only lasts a second. When the boat sank my servers instantly filled up and it took everything I had to hang on to this boat that was now pulling us downstream. We lost all of our gear except the tackle boxes, an oar, and that stupid boat. It took everything we had, but we finally got the boat out of the water and poured the water and the water out of me. I was afraid for my life now. It was supposed to be a fun fishing trip, but now it was a game of survival. We couldn't go back now. the only way to get home was to walk the rest of the way. I was cold and wet and had no options. We had to keep going so we tried again just to sink. We spent most of the day hauling the boat around the rapids and throwing brush all day until it softened and we could put the boat back inside. We came to a large swimming pool, so big that we could put a house in it. Where a few small rapids flow right in the middle. It doesn't look bad, but with what we had in it, we dissuaded being full of extra car. We bypassed the rapids by the pool. As we went we braise the end of the rapids with the boat and walked in. I tried not to sink, but my servers were too heavy. As I tried to swim to shore, my shoe fell off and went down the stream. Being stupid, I chased him on my stomach to get it. The water was faster than I expected as I left it @ CAPS2 me. I was swallowing so much water that I couldn't breathe. I could feel it starting to get deeper and soon I couldn't hit bottom at all. My shoe was right in front of me and I finally reached it with all that was left of beef. I got to the shore and just choked the water there. After ten minutes, I got up and went home. I think it's luck that we survived that day, but some how we did. I learned a lot that day and laughed about it now.

  It is true that laughter is important in any relationship, friendship, and in life sometimes laughter gets you out of trouble, sometimes you get out of trouble. but the more we laugh, the happier we will be. The time that laughter came in handy was at school @ CAPS2. In class @ NUM1 @ CAPS3 the person has been divided into a group. Popular girls, group nerds, hippies and sports people. The dining room was always the way you knew who was who. The popular girls would sit with the sportsmen that each of the girls had a boy to flirt with, the nerds in the group on the floor were making recorders and drums out of cartons of milk, the hippies all in a circle ate the salad in a tray. None of these groups have ever intercepted. I fell into the hippie group. we wore green signs everyday and peace signs on as many clothes as we could put on our tiny bodies. We were the friendliest bunch, we helped out with the friendly activity @ CAPS3 @ CAPS1 there was to do. We did some recycling every day. My school experiences @ CAPS2 were exceptional. The best thing about our group was that we knew how to laugh, we could giggle or laugh so hard our mouths were open and we were holding our guts but no sound was coming out. By a gorgeous @ DATE1 @ TIME1 we decided to sneak out of the dining room, why did we do it ? I do not know. We all really wanted to sit outside and eat. The golden rule at lunchtime was: person @ CAPS3 had to raise their hand to be excused and then take a green card to be able to @ CAPS4 out. After getting a green card, you had to take it to the outside teacher who showed him that you could be outside. But instead of waiting to be excused, we walked around the other side of the building to sneak up to the bright green lawn that was filled with flowers. I don't know how we managed to squeeze in without any teacher seeing us, but we did. When we saw this bright green lawn, we ran towards it like a four year old running towards an ice cream truck. We all hopped and danced and ate our lunches that our mom packed us. we all sat in a circle and passed around food. the day couldn't be better. In fact, it got worse. when we were done eating we went to play on the playground forgetting that we weren't out loud outside in the first place. We rocked on the swings, climbed on the monkey bars. we were screaming, laughing as we spoke. Which prompted a teacher to come and tell all of us to come see her. Her voice was calm as if she was trying to keep a bear in her throat so that it wouldn't come out and eat us. We sat there with big bug eyes and we all held hands. The teacher said that we were in big trouble and that there would be very bad consequences. And we all knew it before she told us. A few seconds after she told us, I started to laugh very loudly. I couldn't stop, it was like someone had cast a spell on me to never stop laughing. Everyone looked at me like you are seriously choosing to laugh out loud now. I was on the floor curled up in a ball with my hands holding my stomach and my face was bright red. I couldn't stop laughing. Finally, I pulled myself together, I looked up at everyone around me looking at me. I looked at the teacher and she started to laugh. We all sat there in silence watching her. Now it was her on the ground, I couldn't even believe it. she looked at all of us and said "@ CAPS4 have fun it's a nice day and you guys are nice girls i will leave it @ CAPS4 this time just don't do it again". We all hugged her and ran for the swings and monkey bars. To this day, I will never forget that moment. A simple laugh got us out of so much trouble. who would have thought. it is true that laughter is important in any relationship, friendship and in life. laughter in life makes the world @ CAPS4 round.

 Laughter is one of the wonderful things that we humans can enjoy. Laugh with friends, family and people you don't even know. We can all enjoy and share laughter, this is one of the amazing things that can bring us together no matter what ethnicity, age, gender or disability. We can all enjoy it together, and no one can take it away from us. Laughter is simple, yet complex in many ways. It's like falling into a pool of @ CAPS1. Laughter, just the word "laughter" brings me joy! When our days turn sour, laughter is there to soften it. Where would we be without the wonders of laughter? Laughter is like a tool. This is what helped me make new friends. In addition, laughter has helped me get out of conflicts of friends and enemies. It also helped me achieve the things I want. Laughter is @ CAPS2 my college years. My family and I moved around a lot and every time I moved I had to make new friends. It became very difficult for me to make new friends every time I transferred to a new school. After settling in and getting used to the environment of the new school, I started to make friends. I noticed that laughter was a key part of getting people to like you and then later I consider you to be called a friend. Once I made new friends and became very comfortable with my school, it was time to relocate. It becomes difficult to make new friends, but it is even more difficult when you have to leave behind the new friends you just made. After moving around so much, I got used to making new friends, and later laughter slowly became more of a tool than something I should enjoy. A tool to make friends. After I entered high school I stopped trying to make new friends because I felt I knew I was going to make new friends and then transfer to another school and then start all over again and make myself new friends. I stopped trying and decided to get more involved in school and get good grades. Later that year I felt like a kid with no friends because I stopped trying. I decided to go make new friends, but somehow it became much more difficult to make friends in high school than in college. I tried to be the funny guy like I was in college, but I just didn't have it in me anymore. Plus, as people get older, the kind of humor people enjoy changes. Over time, I realized that you don't have to make everyone laugh, so that they can be your friends. It was about getting to the person now, being able to relate to yourself and being there when they needed you most. Making friends at a new school isn't easy, but it isn't very difficult either. All you have to do is be open to people and let them know who you are. This is what I learned while making friends. You can't make everyone laugh, because everyone has a different taste when it comes to humor. Humor and laughter are different from each other. Everyone has a different taste when it comes to humor, but we can all come together and have a good laugh. Laughter is wonderful. This is what puts people in a good mood. We as people @ MONTH1 have our differences, but we can always laugh together. It's great to laugh a lot, but it's even better knowing that the person who made you laugh did so so you can be happy. We shouldn't take laughter for granted because it is something that makes us smile.

 In the story I am going to tell you, it is about a friend of mine and myself. After school one day, myself and a friend of mine went to my place for the night. It was great fun, we started playing video games and laughing really hard when one of us died in the game. Then after a while it was dinner time and my mom told us to go downstairs and come and eat. it was a lot of fun at dinner, we threw things at each other when my parents weren't looking. It was fucked up, until dinner was over and we had nothing more to throw at each other. But now it was time to start playing again. Now by that point it was about teenage time and we were really trying it out, so we put the movie on the stepbrother and watched it. It was the best time we had all day, we kept laughing at everything that was said in the movie and it was awesome. We both loved it and really wanted to watch it the next morning. But before we could do that, my friends dad was there to pick it up, so it was the best time with my friend and the funniest ever, too. It was great, we laughed nonstop all night long. It just shows that laughter is the shortest distance between two people.

Has @ CAPS1 ever had that friend who was your best friend, who @ CAPS1 could go to for anything, that @ CAPS1 was so close that the guys at @ CAPS1 knew all about each other, way their noses flared when they laughed at their deepest, darkest secret. Well @ PERSON2 was that type of best friend to me. We two crazy monkeys became friends in the first year. We were never the kind of girls to sit in class and read a book or stay calm throughout school, no we were the girls playing sports with the boys, getting dirty and scratching . We have always laughed, played and had a great time. Laughter was a big part of our friendship because, well, we always laughed. We would be in trouble keeping our parents up late at @ TIME2 with our crazy jokes, loud laughs, and hyper psychotic ninja adventures we had in the middle of @ TIME2. No matter what we did, we could always make a joke of it. “ The guys at @ CAPS1 are great together, ” my mom once said, and all I had to say in response to that was “ I know we're two monkey ninjas. " @ PERSON2 and I had this restaurant we liked to go to, it was @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1. @ CAPS2, @ PERSON2 s @ CAPS5 would get us there at least twice a month and we would still get the exact same thing every time. @ PERSON2 and I could make some funny things that no one else understands. We would sit in the booth with @ CAPS2 and talk about the fun times, silly fights, and end up laughing uncontrollably throughout our time at @ ORGANIZATION1. It was hot @ DATE1 @ TIME1, @ PERSON2 had come to my house and were planning to do @ TIME2. We had all of our @ TIME2 planned, we were going to call him @ CAPS5 and convince him to take us to @ PERSON1, and when we got home we would go jogging and then get ready for an "adventure", c that's what we liked to call them. So we called @ CAPS2 and we creatively convinced him to take us out. But the catch was we had to go to @ LOCATION1's house to mow the yard. , plant some plants, weed part of the garden, then he would take us in. So of course we went and did all the work we had agreed to do, and we went to @ ORGANIZATION1, dirty, sweaty and exhausted. By this time everyone at @ ORGANIZATION1 knew our names by heart, we would make jokes with them and sometimes we even had to go to the back room and get our ranch back if it wasn't too crowded. We ate our food, got extra fries, an extra ranch and sat there with a full stomach. We were all ready to go, but @ CAPS2 had to go to the bathroom. So @ PERSON2 and I sat there and waited while he was in the bathroom. It was taking longer than usual which was fine with us as we wanted to talk about this boy that @ PERSON2 had a "thing" with, that we couldn't talk about while his @ CAPS5 was around. Finally he comes out of the bathroom, and I notice his zipper is down but he's so close that I didn't want to tell @ PERSON2 about it until we were further away from him, and 'he's in his hyper playful mood doesn't take us away from him enough for me to tell him. As we walked out of the door, I finally told @ PERSON2 to tell him @ CAPS5 that his zipper was down. As she turns and watches she bursts out laughing because while his zipper is down he's talking to a group of people working there. So as we both laugh hysterically, we try to tell him. We finally made him start to come out of the door, and at that point @ PERSON2 says in between laughs "@ CAPS5 your zipper is down" he looks down and makes his nervous laugh / oh my God and the closed. All the way home, @ PERSON2 and I are laughing as hard as we can. Our stomachs were about to explode from laughing so hard. @ CAPS2 was in the front seat laughing every now and then because he couldn't believe his zipper was down all the time. And as we approached my house he said "there was a song playing, and I wanted to hurry up and write the lyrics before they were finished, I really liked that song". To me that was the funniest thing @ CAPS2 ever said. @ CAPS2 went home and bought the song on i @ CAPS7, and also learned to zipper more often. @ PERSON2 is the perfect best friend for me, we are alike in many ways. But our sense of humor is the most similar.

 Laughter is the best medicine for a friend who is in pain. My friend @ CAPS1 and I were best friends, he came to my house every weekend. So while waiting, I decided to go cycling. I drove around the block several times, when I hit a sidewalk and crashed. My handlebars hit me in the lower rib cage. My mom took me to the doctor's office to see if I had a broken rib. The doctor said I only bruised him. On the way home I was in so much pain my mom stopped for ice cream it didn't help. When we got home, I stayed on the couch for a while. Heard knocking, it was @ CAPS1. The first thing he did was ask him what happened, I said I didn't used to talk about it now. We had dinner and then played a game. Then we watched movies and we both finally fell asleep. We woke up to the smell of bacon. I was still a little asleep, the moment I realized I had woken up @ CAPS1 was out of stars. I was in so much pain that I couldn't get up. So I stayed there for a little while. @ CAPS1 looked back to see why I didn't get up. He saw me just laying there. We just started to laugh, I noticed that I was feeling a little better, but I didn't think much about it. After we ate we turned on the @ NUM1 my mom said everyone had to clean up but @ CAPS1 and I could play because I was injured and @ CAPS1 was a guest. We play mortal combat @ NUM2, @ CAPS6 and @ PERSON1, and @ CAPS7 and @ ORGANIZATION1. I won most of the time, let's say he started cheating, but it was still pretty fun. When we were done, we watched a funny movie, we laughed so much that when we did, I almost got rid of my rib cage. We went to the park to shoot hoops. As soon as he shot it he bounced off the ledge and hit him in the face, I thought it was funny, he didn't seem to think so. When we got bored, we headed to the market for a snack. When we were eating I told him what happened with my bike he asked if he made a visible mark we looked and saw he looked like a smiley face it was funny but frightening. When we got home he said he wanted to ride a bike. At first I was a little scared, but nothing serious. We drove around my yard for a while. His mother received them shortly after. Then I went inside and sat there. My mom asked me how I felt, but it didn't hurt anymore. I got better because laughter is the best medicine.

 One rainy day, @ DATE1 in a far away place, it was a soccer game. I was in. I remember that day like it was yesterday. It was the last game of the season so it was important to me but some things went wrong in the process. I was going to do the same as I said. I was just wearing my uniform, my aunt said goodbye like me. but from the deep blue of shyness, a big cloud of black rain emerges. Oh @ CAPS1. so I'm on the beach thinking to myself that the game is going to be called off. My turn to enter. now in police ready for the ball, @ CAPS2 I fall on my face. then I fall again to coach me out. so he did, i go back to the beach hoping the team can do it without me. game over we lose by two points, it's time to leave now but where is my aunt? I called her on my coach's phone, answer @ CAPS1. I'm thinking about myself ok shes a little late but as i watch ten time go on @ NUM1 then one o'clock. finally shes here. cold wet and crazy about the game. all my aunt said was @ PERSON1 don't put mud on the seat. well, it's kinda hard to do when it's all on me. my aunt says @ PERSON1 you are not going to the party looking like this i said but i have to, there is no time to waste. after a little argument my aunt says ok so I walk in and see all this food and all my muddy teammates like me. Looks like one could move to show the heavens what a day.

Have you ever been hit by a basketball in the face ?. One day I was playing basketball with my friends, I didn't have a school so I think it was like @ NUM1 pm. We had a blast playing my favorite sport and making jokes. The day was going well, I was doing hoops and I had good jokes, everyone was laughing. My friend @ CAPS1 asks me about a girl so I turn my face to him and then the basketball hit me in the face at first I got angry it was and accident so everything was fine but then my friends i started laughing so they stopped him that day so i lost him i wanted to hit them all. I started to think that if either of them had been punched in the face the same way I did, I would have laughed too, but they shot me, so I walked out of the house angry. When I got home I was still mad so I went to the garage I have a punching bag in there. I started hitting him to take out my anger, that's what my dad told me when I was little when I'm angry, don't take it out on the family, go for a run or hit something but don't take it out on the family. I was there for about half an hour, then I went to the kitchen to eat something. My mom was there, then she saw my face, it was still red from the blow. She started yelling at me saying what happened was I was fighting stuff like that. I was still angry and then she would yell at me, which made me even angrier. I had five missed calls and three messages from them saying if I was crying and things like that still making jokes. Time passed and I was still angry that I forgot what had happened. My younger brother @ CAPS2 came into my room with some food. I was still hungry because I don't get anything from the kitchen because my mother was yelling at me, so he left with no food and on an empty stomach, he ate it in front of me. make faces and say it was the best sandwich ever man I take it I took it from him he wanted that so I sat down and started to eat it he walked up to me and asked me why i was angry and i told him he started to laugh hitting him slowly, he asks me if i want to go play video games. So we went to play @ NUM2 is an army game, it's really good. I suck every time he kills me he starts saying jokes like who your dad is and stuff like that. After a while I forget what happened, I beg to smile, so my brother and I come out of the house to play soccer. I was hit again my brother kicked the ball hard it was going fast when I saw him I had already been hit by it but this time it was in my stomach everyone laughs at the beginning I shoot but then i hear everyone laughing and thinking about getting hit twice on the same day and in the same way because i turn my head i can't believe it was funny so i start to hate too. My friends came over and said they were sorry they laughed at me but it was funny and whoever hit me said it was my fault because I wasn't looking, I was like anything. I ask them if they wanted to play soccer with us they said yes we were playing for about five minutes when my brother kicked the ball and hit my friend in the face the one who hit me with the basketball i start packed and I told him why wasn't he looking and what's going on is coming. It put a big smile on my face and after a while everything was fine again, we were having fun without anger for each other, that's once the laughter changed how I was feeling.

 The elements of laughter are showing emotion to others to let them know you had a good time or to show that they are special. Laughter is sometimes in me. I laugh when I'm having a good time. The biggest laugh I always have is with friends saying crazy things when we go on the bus after school. May the joy of a friend and of you for decades of school. I always come home with a smile. There are always jokes to tell to be happy. When the bell rings at the end of my last class, I am prevented from working hard. When I go to my bus located in the front of the school. I feel isolated from the work I had to do. But I can't wait for my friends to come on the bus. We always have a good time. I completely forget about school and laugh with the jokes and ridiculous stories we tell. When we get to the first stop, everyone happily exits even me. This trial lasted three years. But next year will be the last ride on the @ NUM1 bus, my favorite number. Hope we still have a good time.

 The new term had started and leadership was my second period. Having no idea of the responsibilities of a leadership student, I was skeptical about taking the course. After days of lessons, I started to appreciate it more and more. After about a week, the professor announced that we would be on stage to help set up and organize the next assembly. I had never done anything like this so I was a little excited. The days passed and the whole class practiced assembling the assembly, running to our seats, moving props and stacking chairs. The day of editing finally arrived, it was time for the show. The students scrambled to their seats as we rushed behind the curtains. Everything was perfectly set up. The curtains rose and the assembly began. My peers and I were behind the scene watching the assembly unfold. The school group performed a long series of boring songs, the curtains fell, and the entire leadership class ran out onto the stage, picked up and stacked the chairs the group had just used. After that, we all ran to get the stands and dragged them to the front of the stage. The chorus was now about to perform, so we retired behind the curtains. The choir sang their songs and we watched, but as they got ready for their last song, the students moved around leaving a large free space in the top row. With the last song of the choir, they performed a simple swing dance to accompany their song. My friends from the leadership class and I noticed this big open space in the choir and thought it would be hilarious if one of us went up there and pretended to sing and dance. However, none of us had the courage to do so. The choir finished its song and dance, the first assembly was over. We then cleaned up and got ready for the second assembly. It was time for the second assembly and everything was going to be preformed again. The students came in, took their seats, the group played, we stacked the chairs and moved the stands. It was time for the choir to come out and sing once more. The idea of how much fun it would be to stand on the stands and dance came back to us once again. Finally, we convinced one of our classmates to do it. She ran to the choir room and put on a choir dress, put her hair in a funny bun tied to her forehead and walked up to the stands. She took the vacant seat in the top row. The song began as well as the dance. She began to dance at random, without any correspondence with the other members of the dance choir. It was obvious she had no place up there. The crowd quickly began to understand what was going on. Laughs erupted from the seats, but soon after, laughter erupted behind the stage as well. I laughed like I had never laughed before. It was painful, tears were running down my face, I was looking for air. Breathless and preparing for a deep breath, as at that point the song had a silent, dead pause. The auditorium went completely silent, I inhaled, and as I inhaled this tune, my body managed to emit an extremely loud and embarrassing screeching cry. The people behind the curtain were staring at me, I knew it was heard throughout the auditorium. Embarrassed, I laughed even harder, causing more pain, tears, and lack of oxygen. The song ended followed by the end of the laughter, then the end of the assembly. The girl came down from the bleachers and we all rushed out of the building, hiding the dress along the way. We laughed until our next period, listening to the students in the hallway talking about it. Laughter filled the school for hours. Talking about who it was, what really happened and why it happened was on everyone's mind except ours. The second period leadership students knew exactly what had happened. We had the pleasure of telling everyone at school about the little dirty things. Over the next few days, however, teachers learned about it as well. Not thinking through our actions until the end, we should soon suffer the consequences. We were told it was irresponsible and childish. We had a plethora of possible punishments, suspension from school, school @ DATE1, expulsion, apologies to the choir class, and loss of the privilege of being the leader. After the school board spoke to our parents and gave the event some serious thought, we got away with having a school day @ DATE1 and apologizing to the whole choir class. The school board realized this was just a joke, letting us go more easily than it could have been. In my eyes, the farce was worth it. For weeks, every night, I would go to bed laughing at this assembly of leaders.

 Have you ever laughed enough to cry? Your chest is bubbling with laughter and tears flow from your eyes; faces turn bright red, and your body is practically seizing. It's not the kind of forced laugh, it's out of control. It is pure happiness. I laugh like that at least twice a day, tears and everything. If it's even possible that your laughter reflexes are connected to the tear ducts, I swear I would. If I laugh well during the day, then I won't be so sad later. It made me a much happier person. And it even brought me closer to other people. @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. It was a time in my life when I worried and dwelled on the past. I was a deep fourth grade student. But my friends were very different. @ CAPS4 had his bad mood sometimes, and whenever we felt depressed we would sit on the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. Very creative, I know. This @ CAPS2 was navy blue and sat right around the corner of the playing field where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives. One day when we were sent off for recess four of my close friends and I went to @ CAPS2. We watched the boys run as fast as @ CAPS4 could on the field to start their daily soccer game. Almost all of the guys at @ ORGANIZATION1 would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the @ ORGANIZATION1 stallions. And sometimes the girls would join in too. While we were sitting there sulking on @ CAPS2, a few boys approached us. "@ CAPS3 to play soccer with us? We might need more people!" @ CAPS4 said. We weren't in the mood to play football, but with the harassment persisting, we had to give in. The square lot was wet with rain @ ORGANIZATION2 and the grass turned to muddy porridge wherever you walked. We girls avoided all contact and we ran much slower than the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team and take cover when needed. Football lightened our moods and was much better at making us happy than @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. Thus, a new tradition was formed. Every day we went out with the boys and had no worries in the world while we were hunting. We plunged into the soggy mess of a pitch to save a ball and rushed to tag anyone we could get access to. The @ CAPS2 was out of our minds as we ran around having fun. But one day while we were playing it was very muddy due to a thunderstorm the night before. It was difficult to navigate as you were running on the slippery ground. People were constantly slipping and falling. And then something amazing happened, it started raining again. But no one had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and carried on. The rain blinded us and the slippery ground was of no help. A collision was therefore inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had gone through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot from the end zone and sprinted the best she could under the circumstances. Out of nowhere, a boy from the other team appeared in front of her. But instead of swerving so as not to hit him, she slipped. It was a priceless moment, almost out of a cartoon. Her legs slipped under her and she landed squarely on his butt. Everyone on the pitch was already turning around, hugging their stomachs with the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice that she was heading in his direction. That's when she pulled it out too. But he had the bad luck to land face down on the ground. Her body sprawled over hers with her head directly in the brown, damp ground. Even the two who fell couldn't help but laugh. The game came to a halt as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football and uncontrollable laughter.

 Many believe that laughter is the key to starting a great friendship. @ CAPS1 can mend broken bridges between people and even improve great relationships even more. Laughter can be such a powerful thing and most don't understand @ CAPS7 powerful. I especially didn't know it until two years ago when I met @ PERSON1. @ CAPS1 only moved my old @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2 to understand the full potential of the laughter of the beginning of a great friendship @ CAPS1 it all started a few weeks before the end of school when the news was received. At the time I was part of a small group @ CAPS3, in a small church, in a small town. @ CAPS3 @ CAPS2, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON3 were moving and could no longer lead the @ CAPS3 group. The entire church congregation was saddened by the sudden news. But none were as depressed as the @ CAPS3 they had touched in their many years of ministry. We had gotten used to the couple. Many of those who had been there the longest, including myself, had spent nights with them or, in my case, babysitting their young daughter. They were like family to all of us and no one wanted to see them go. But sometimes I wonder if they hadn't, what would have happened. Many wishes and tears were exchanged between the day they left. As a congregation, everyone believed that no one could ever touch our hearts like they did. But it was just a thought. Just two months later, it was rumored that someone from @ LOCATION1 was traveling here to our small town of @ LOCATION2 for an interview for the newly opened position. All the teenagers were being watched the moment he walked through the door. His name was @ PERSON1, only in his early twenties, but had a lot of ministry experience. My first thought was that this must have been some kind of joke! @ CAPS7 could he lead a group of children if he is only a child himself !? I was not very attached to him. No one else either. But something was very different about him. He wasn't afraid to tell us about his life, @ CAPS7 he had grown up and seemed to be totally honest with every question we asked. And that's when we knew as a group @ CAPS3 that maybe it was him. Even though I knew @ PERSON1 would be our new @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4, I still didn't want to accept @ CAPS1. I tried and tried to avoid it although @ CAPS1 still seemed like we had to treat each other more than we wanted to. So eventually @ PERSON1 decided that @ CAPS1 was the time we needed to get to know each other. A @ DATE1 @ TIME1 my mom got a call from someone at church she didn't want to tell me who but that I had to go. So I did. And who was there? @ PERSON1, in the sanctuary just the two of us and associate @ CAPS4, because @ CAPS1 would be too inappropriate for us to be alone. "your mom didn't tell you @ CAPS6 you're here, did she ?" I laughed, "@ CAPS6 no she didn't" "@ CAPS7 are you feeling and me talking? Go out where you want?" "uh .... ok @ CAPS7 do you plan to go to @ ORGANIZATION1?" The question was confusing to him, @ CAPS1 did it for the most part, but he accepted the idea. "@ CAPS8 @ CAPS6 are we going to @ ORGANIZATION1 ?" He said as he pulled into the parking lot. “I don't know @ CAPS1 was just the first thing that came to my mind.” We both laughed. I felt more comfortable with him now and thought for the first time that maybe this would be quite a fun trip. As we walked through the building @ CAPS1 started to get pretty boring. But the boredom subsided when we decided to walk across the toy aisle and go off all the toy alarms and sirens. Toy after toy, we started to explode as we walked through the aisle, touching every toy that made some sort of absurd noise that would cause anyone to climb up the wall, which many did. Finally, we walked around the store to other departments in the store and got to know each other better. @ CAPS1 surprised me that we both like the same things a lot. He told me more about his childhood as @ CAPS7 he was adopted and what @ CAPS1 looked like before and after. @ CAPS1 was weird that not long ago I didn't want anything to do with @ PERSON1 and now I was walking around @ ORGANIZATION1 laughing and having a good time. That was about three years ago. Shortly after, @ PERSON1 had to leave. A lot of rumors were told to @ CAPS6 because he really didn't tell anyone other than that the board asked him to leave. It doesn't matter why I'm still in touch with him and I'm glad the day at @ ORGANIZATION1 has taken place.

 Although my sister and I have very different personalities and most of the time we didn't find humor in the same things, we still shared some humorous moments. This is the time when you decide to go with the flow and enjoy someone's company instead of letting them bother you. One sunny day at @ LOCATION1, I managed to convince my sister to go rollerblading with me. My dad took us to a park with a huge pond in the middle. The pond was nice in the fact that there was a smooth sidewalk running all around the pond for my sister and I at @ CAPS1. The pond was not so beautiful in that it was very littered with ducks and geese and of course their droppings. We have always believed that pond water is one of the most disgusting things on earth. We put on our inline skates and stood up carefully. Our dad was going to take a nap in the car while we made our laps around the lake. As we were skating we noticed a man and a woman sharing a date together in a very small boat. They were totally unaware that their boat was tilting strongly to one side. My sister and I thought it would be hilarious if all of a sudden the boat overturned. We let that thought slip away and continued our rout. On our next turn, we heard a woman screaming. we looked up and saw that it was the woman who was in the boat. The woman was now standing on the shore, shouting for the man to retrieve all of his things that had fallen from the boat and are now floating in the rough water of the pond. The man was waiting in the water up to his chest to pick up their items and try to deal with his upside down boat. "This date has been a failure by challenge," I thought. We could hardly help but burst out laughing. We got back to the car as fast as we could. My sister was in front of me and when she tried to stop she couldn't. She basically slammed the body of the car, fell backwards and rolled just below. My father quickly opened the door to find me crying with laughter. We pulled my sister out from under the car and drove home.

 When I told my mom I wanted @ CAPS5 from sunset to sunrise to fundraise for a trip to @ LOCATION1, she laughed. Her laugh was pure sarcasm, as if she was saying, "Is this a joke?" Still, when the crazy idea of running for @ NUM1 hours straight got really thought through, the laughter started to fade. The idea made sense; I wanted to go to @ LOCATION1 with my school group for a cost of around @ MONEY1. My family didn't have that money, and I certainly wasn't going to bribe my neighbors penny by penny to buy cheap cookie dough from a magazine. I needed to earn my money, in a way that was not only meaningful, but also effective. What better way to do it than doing a long distance @ CAPS5; a skill that I not only loved, but also excelled in ? The plan started small ; I would @ CAPS5 from sunset to sunrise with friends, wanting to talk about @ MONEY2. After consulting with my distance coach, I realized that running for @ NUM1 hours would earn me more than @ NUM3 miles in a row. What if I was fifteen and had never run a marathon before? Something inside me told me it was possible. And so we made the plan; I was at @ CAPS5 about @ NUM4 miles per week, running three hours on @ DATE3. I ran about ten miles a day, including hill repetitions, backwards runs, and loads of lunges. For some reason my trainer and I agreed I could do it. Running was one thing, but there was also the reason behind running; Fund raising. A family friend, @ PERSON1, who was both a runner and an organization ace, helped me out. When I informed him that my goal was to increase @ MONEY2, he looked at me and said firmly that I could do better. We started with local businesses, asking for things ranging from bananas to an energy gel called "@ CAPS1". @ PERSON1 taught me to dress, talk and present to every business, helping me make a flyer to display in cafes and organize the money I brought. Then came the friends. Surprisingly, I discovered that a lot of my friends not only wanted to donate, but also to participate in all- @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5, and this is how the current "shifts" were created. Soon I had about 20 people going to @ CAPS5 with me, ten companies sponsoring me and four "drivers" driving cars with mattresses, food and water in the back for me. support and support my "crew". Before I knew it, my whole community was cheering me on and this crazy, laughable idea continued. The @ CAPS4 of the "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 All- @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5" came before I knew it. The day before, my stomach was in a knot and it was almost impossible to rest. Yet as people arrived ready to @ CAPS5, lead and cheer for the whole event, my fears started to fade. The weather was beautiful, with clear skies and decent temperatures at the start of @ DATE4, and everyone who came was happy and encouraging. As the sun set on that fateful day of @ DATE1, a group of about twenty teenagers, all with a crazy goal and strong minds, left my house in an awkward jog, knowing they would return when the sun was out. would get up the next day after conquering something almost impossible. As we ran, the headlamps were on, the music was on, quirky running games played to pass the time and silly songs were sung to keep our feet moving in the vividly cool @ CAPS4. The hardest part for me was getting home after @ NUM5 miles for a bathroom break to @ TIME1 and realizing I still had seven hours left. As the miles and minutes started to mix in the seemingly endless @ CAPS4, it became hard to believe the sun would rise again. We all wanted so badly to stop, rest and sleep. This @ CAPS4, with our feet pounding the cold pavement, we ran like shadows through the endless @ CAPS4, our eyes searching for the sunrise that would signify it's time to stop. The sunrise that rose in the morning from @ DATE2 to @ NUM6 am was the most welcoming sight I have ever seen. @ NUM7 miles behind me, and way above @ NUM8 for every person in my party, we were all exhausted and cold to the bone. Everyone who had rested hopped out of the assistance cars and joined me for the last mile, all of us watching in wonder as the light crept into the darkness, stunning the still, frost-covered world. of a warm light. The sun rose big and orange, and when my feet finally stopped, an exhausted but exuberant cry left everyone's throats. It was then, in this beautiful sunrise, that mom and I kissed and laughed; a laugh that wasn't sarcastic, but spoke of the way a girl who had done the impossible.

 My best friend is probably my brother, @ PERSON2. It was in the middle of @ DATE1 and we were sitting outside on the wooden table in our mother's garden. @ PERSON2 started telling me how badly he wanted to be done with high school and that he was " just done with this ". I sat there listening intently for maybe thirty minutes as @ PERSON2 poured out her heart and almost broke mine in her distress. @ PERSON2's best friend, @ PERSON1, had just told @ PERSON2 that @ CAPS1 was dating the girl @ PERSON2 loved, then their friendship was over. @ PERSON2 was extremely hurt by this betrayal added to the fact that he was afraid of being kicked out of school because of his grades, and the pressure from our parents at the time, was just too much for one. seventeen year old @ PERSON2 manage. I talked to @ PERSON2 for at least half an hour after that about what I thought he should do, at the end of our heart-to-heart conversation I told @ PERSON2 that, "@ CAPS1 you don't get it and start getting good grades, they're gonna kick you out of school, @ PERSON2. Honestly @ CAPS1 this happens, I'm gonna be really mad at you because the only person @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 is gonna have to s 'take it to me. ” We both laughed softly for a minute, stopped and laughed until we cried. Not sure to this day what was so funny, maybe how serious everything was when we were just kids or @ CAPS1, it was just a stress and anxiety release for both of us. My tiny little, lame little joke that I dropped at the end of our conversation just made everything look alright, made us think how young we are, how minor so many of these issues were in the big one. diagram of life. That initial laughter made is possible for us to just let go. After that @ PERSON2 and I continued our life as @ CAPS1, it had never happened, never talked about it. Except @ PERSON2 never got a bad grade in the rest of his high school career, he chose his friend over a chance with the girl but found another girl who has @ ORGANIZATION1's approval. Was it the laughter that helped @ PERSON2 get through this difficult time ? I couldn't tell, but what I do know is that there was laughter there and @ PERSON2 did what he had to do.

 The sound of laughter could be the one that breaks all barriers. A single chuckle or a quiet chuckle can expand someone's world. Laughter is a sign. It is something that tells someone that new ideas, new desires, or new dreams are going to be created. Once you laugh, he or she gets along well with someone - they form a relationship. The first time @ PERSON1 and I laughed together, there was no doubt in my mind that it was the start of something new. Once I heard her cautious, uncertain, delighted, and fair laugh @ CAPS2-so-very-cute, I was ready to be blown away. I had the privilege of hearing this laughter for three days of my summer of the year @ DATE2. It was a @ DATE1, and over the past four days I was hopping and jumping through the mountains and hills in the endless wilderness of @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION1. That day, my cousin @ CAPS1 and I were about to walk through familiar territory: the mall. As a bonus, that cautious, uncertain, delighted, and fair laugh @ CAPS2-so-very-cute was bouncing and jumping with us. When @ PERSON1 approached us in the food court, he definitely managed to play cool. You could tell he had taken the time to comb his hair and decide what to wear just to look as chic as he was. "@ CAPS2, hi guys !" he cried softly. Our eyes met immediately, and already my cheeks were aching. The next few minutes we spent together were crucial. I needed to make a good impression on this guy. We were in line at @ ORGANIZATION1, where he picked up his usual order of two @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4 '@ CAPS5 without lettuce, a large order of fries and a large @ CAPS6. Pepper. As for me, all I wanted was a little vanilla ice cream cone. Glancing through the other register, I saw @ PERSON1 turn his head out of the corner of my eye. "@ CAPS7, do you have @ MONEY1 ?" he asked me hesitantly. He fiddled with his pockets a little, while brushing her luscious blonde locks away from her face. I laughed silently, and his reaction was one that has been one of my favorite things about him to this day - his smile. Still laughing, I said "@ CAPS8" and carefully handed him the @ MONEY1. To this day, @ PERSON1 is my best friend. Finally, I got the @ MONEY1 he owed me. From that moment we were in the queue at @ ORGANIZATION1, the following hours have been filled with laughter. I can't really remember a single thing he said that didn't at least make me smile as much as I could. Literally, with several jumps and flips, that day I made a new friend. And even then, I was totally unaware of the incredible journey there was to come with this boy. It was because of this very first natural instinct that @ PERSON1 and I both had towards each other ; to laugh. If I had never laughed so hard that my stomach ached, or if I had never laughed so hard that tears rolled down my cheeks, there is simply no way we would have had the connection that we had. Her uncertain, delighted, and fair laugh @ CAPS2-so-very-cute never gets old. Laughter is one of the main keys to our friendship. One of us has to give a little laugh every now and then. In addition, @ PERSON1 is always in @ LOCATION2. I'm not. As desperately as the two of us would like to be, we're not in the same place. We must be able to prosper and grow in separate places. So with that, if anyone once said, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." so they were absolutely right. When @ PERSON1 and I laugh together, we don't feel like we are fifteen hundred kilometers apart. So that laugh, that fair laugh @ CAPS2-so-very-cute, is an element and part of my life that I'm indescribably grateful for. This laughter formed one of the greatest relationships of my short fifteen years of life, and I sincerely hope it will form many more wonderful memories in the years to come.

 The surrounding area is dimly lit, accompanied by a shaded fluorescent lamp in the corner. Our thunderous television showing an action-packed sci-fi movie drowns out the secular rap music streaming out of my brothers' headphones. Snuggled up on the sofa, my sister @ PERSON2 and I alternately braid our hair. Our little kittens @ ORGANIZATION2 and @ PERSON1 run towards their food and their water. As always @ PERSON1 is superior and @ ORGANIZATION2 rushes to the chairs in the dining room, defeated. Irritated @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 sighs deeply in frustration once @ ORGANIZATION2 triggers his laptop charger and pulls it out of the socket. The keys jingle, the door slams, quick footsteps: @ CAPS3's house! It is now @ NUM1 o'clock and we have settled on the couch and everyone is checking the seats after they grab some food. The aroma of spicy food @ CAPS4 smells the whole apartment as everyone feasts on chalupas and swallows @ ORGANIZATION1 from @ LOCATION1. Towels are handed out and the cats linger at our feet, waiting for their share. The last bite of my chalupa is split between the cats, causing a bit of a ruckus. @ PERSON1 undertakes @ ORGANIZATION2 ! The thief in @ PERSON1's attitude begins to glow as she steals the portion of @ ORGANIZATION2. This makes @ ORGANIZATION2 whistle towards her and jump onto the coffee table. Along the way, she loads the five glasses at the end of the table, managing to spill two. Then the nacho cheese, being very imperceptible, covers its gray striped paw, leaving one inch yellow-orange circles to intrigue us. Tiny but sharp white teeth are exposed and she devours the remains of @ PERSON2's chalupa. Streaks of sparkling blue @ ORGANIZATION1 rain down on the coffee table and puddles gather at my feet from the new suede sofa. Muffled by a thunderous laugh, @ PERSON2 yells at @ ORGANIZATION2 for stealing his chalupa. Following @ ORGANIZATION2's leak, @ PERSON1 is innocently trotting behind her. My sister still smokes angrily, so in an attempt to calm her down, I take off my new stained sock from @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 and catapult the mess to her head. Instead of the sock slapping her like I'd hoped, she hissed close to her ear and splashed my mother's stomach. Between the sock and the cats, the whole family has a crush! @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 reconstructs the situation and its frenzied sound effects encourage our laughter even more. After a few minutes, the laughter subsides and we prepare for the next humorous incident. I'm frozen and muddy after a rainy softball practice, my siblings are lounging, @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 is frustrated with the job failure, and @ CAPS3 is tired and exhausted from a long day at work. We all look forward to what the night has in store for us : resting our busy brains on a soft pillow and allowing sleep to take control of our lives for the next @ NUM1 hours. Beyond our sleepiness, we can still happily spend time with each other. Considering that @ PERSON1 is younger than @ ORGANIZATION2, hilarious situations like this keep my family entertained on a daily basis. Surprisingly, @ ORGANIZATION2 was wearing the warrior costume this time around, which added a few extra minutes to the process of hilarity. Not only that, by the fact that it had a negative impact on everyone's dinner. My family is fortunate in knowing how to see the light in strange situations. The main element of our memorable moments is laughter. Laughter is one of the few bonds that our family will keep forever.

                                                 I learned to laugh on DATE1 while we were on vacation at @ LOCATION2, I realized that laughter is an integral part of our lives and is an important factor that can keep friends and family together. Not that long ago, I also found out that laughter can relieve you of stress and even help you lose weight, which I found to be quite interesting. My sister, on the other hand, still didn't believe that laughter could do all of this. She thought it was just overkill. She believed that if her friends didn't want to hang out with her then there was something wrong with them, that if we didn't have enough food in the house it was probably my parents' fault. . There was always someone to blame for everything that happened to him, there was always a downside to everything. But this @ DATE1 was going to be different, she was about to find out that she didn't have to live her life this way, because there is always an alternative. The trip to @ LOCATION2 was something everyone was looking forward to, even me. In fact, I was really excited to see my cousins and the rest of the family. Everyone packed their bags, we got ready to leave, got in the car and left for the airport. My aunt @ CAPS1 was already waiting for us at the city airport @ LOCATION2. Everything was going great. So far ... When we got there my aunt drove us all to our small town in the state of @ LOCATION1, about an hour and a half from the airport. As we got there I noticed my sister had an odd look on her face, she looked somewhat confused, lost in her own thoughts as if she was worried about something. ... "I said sounding a little sarcastic and hoping to strike up a conversation." @ CAPS3's face is all weird! "She said and it was the @ DATE1 thing that 'she told me until we reached our destination. Arriving at our grandparents' house, we started to see all of our family members who were already waiting for us outside. The joy of seeing them there was amazing. I looked around and saw my sister I was glad she looked happy I thought she was actually enjoying the moment I had no idea @ CAPS2 was wrong with her and her attitude suddenly changed until we came to my grandmother's little playground in the garden.While I was there I met new family members, saw old familiar faces and I remembered good and bad memories, memories that I thought had disappeared from my mind. It turned out that e were still there, in the back of my head where I had tried to hide them so they would never come back again, but somehow they managed to come out and come back into my thoughts, and that That's when I started to feel like a monster again. Suddenly I had a flash back to when we came to visit, a few years ago. That's when it all came to me, I saw the whole scene again, I felt horrible. There she was, my little sister @ PERSON1 playing in the swings, suddenly she let go of the swing and she felt right in a puddle of mud that was there. Everyone laughed, I laughed. I thought it was funny, but she didn't laugh, she didn't cry either, she just got up and ran inside. I never stopped asking her if she was okay, I hadn't realized how much my actions had affected her. It was all my fault, I knew she was very sensitive in certain specific situations, but I didn't help her, I didn't give her the comfort and support that she needed from her big sister, so she never learned to laugh at herself and keep going. That would have been good advice for her instead of making fun of her. Then after a few minutes of thinking about it I walked over to her and apologized, she looked a little confused at first, but then she realized where I was going. It made the rest of the trip a lot easier, now that I knew @ CAPS2 was wrong we both did our best to fix the issue and work on his self esteem. Laughter was the perfect therapy for her. All she had to do was learn to laugh at herself when things didn't turn out the way she wanted them to. It was tough but we achieved our goal. My sister discovered the power of laughter and learned to cope with her mistakes. Life has taught us both an important lesson than @ DATE1. I am sure this was one of the most exciting trips we have ever taken and the memories of this trip will stay with us forever.

Laughing I've always been someone who laughs a lot. It doesn't take a lot of effort for me to laugh out loud, the subject doesn't even have to be that funny. I'm not the “giggle” type though. I think my laugh looks good on me because I'm calm, and so does my laughter. I'm always a little embarrassed when my laughter gets louder than usual. The weather has been very cold lately with snowfall here and there. I just got itchy for a nice warm bathing weather. Last weekend my boyfriend @ PERSON1 and I went to the mountain to play in the deep snow. After a few hours in the snow, we came back down the mountain to go to his place and use his hot tub. Obviously it was very cold and I, being more of a nice weather girl, just wanted to go somewhere to warm up upstairs. We stopped by my house first so I could take my bath suite which I recently ordered offline and was dying to use. We left our clothes in the back room and ran into the cold to get into the hot tub on its back patio. The hot water was so good; he relaxed my icy body and tense muscles. We were in the hot tub for about forty-five minutes before noticing how hungry we were. As we were all warming up we decided that @ CAPS1 sounds good. We jumped out of the hot tub and ran to the back room to dry off and get dressed. I was completely dry and started to put my jeans back on. When I put my first leg in my jeans, I just felt like I was going to fall. Sure enough, when I had my second leg halfway through the other side, I lost my balance, tripped over a huge exercise machine, and fell hard on my butt. I started to laugh out loud, with @ PERSON1 I was a little embarrassed but at least it didn't hurt too much. After I got up and walked for a few minutes, my butt started to hurt more and more. @ PERSON1 kept making jokes about my fall even though they were pretty funny I tried not to laugh. He was facing me as we were chatting, when we were done talking he turned to the door to leave and hit his head on the same exercise machine I had tripped over minutes before. Instantly, I wanted to laugh. I couldn't move, I was laughing too hard. It looked like it must have hurt when he hit his head, he had a nice red bump under his eye. He didn't find it as funny as I did and just walked out the door. Still, laughing hysterically, I tried to follow him to the door, but it was hard not to laugh so much. My stomach ached from all the laughter when it finally started to calm down. Still having a little laugh inside me, I walked over to his pickup to wait for him while he spoke to his father. When I turned to see if he was coming, I started laughing again just seeing him walk towards the pickup. The expression on his face when he saw me laughing again was simply priceless. I could imagine why I looked ridiculous to him; sitting all alone in his pickup, laughing hysterically again. Laughter is one of the few things in this world that is free. Everyone's laughter is unique and can change depending on the situation. There are many different laughs that a person can have such as nervous, happy, dizzy, etc. If people can share a laugh, it can bring them together. All over the world, laughter is a universal sign of happiness. People of any age, race or religion can share a laugh. All in all, laughing is just a great feeling.

 It all started one morning when I heard my huge waking mass spring up again. So I reached out and pressed the button to turn off the extremely noisy craft. When I noticed I woke up ten minutes late so I jumped out of bed and ran for the shower. When I was done I dressed in my @ CAPS1 shirt and jeans, which I normally wear, then unplugged my cell phone from the charger and put it in my pocket. Faced with the current situation, I walked down the stairs and into the kitchen to prepare the modest meal of oatmeal. After I finished eating, I put my books away and walked up the stairs to brush my teeth. After that, I swept off my coat and my hat in one fell swoop. I tied them to my person, grabbed my backpack and went out. I stood there on that cold, rainy morning, pondering what the day would hold for me. Suddenly there was a loud noise, I turned to face the approaching threat and found the bus had arrived. My mind quickly recovered from the slightly surprised state of @ CAPS2 and I got on the bus. The bus ride was no different from the others, the kids were screaming about what happened at school yesterday, what they were doing @ CAPS2 @ DATE1, and other seemingly pointless conversations. There I was sitting, staring, gazing out the bus window, observing, studying, and mapping the enormous vehicle's current path. We stopped at one of the bus stops and on the bus came my good friend @ PERSON1. As usual, she came over to sit next to me and we started talking about the usual cars, music and the occasional joke. As I started to develop a creative and captivating joke, she just tossed one off the top of her head. We both started to laugh out loud, I even felt a tear form in my eye. We didn't @ CAPS1 stop laughing until we got to school, and my joke was successfully forgotten. The joke stuck in my head all day, until the day of @ CAPS2, I still think it's one of the best I've ever heard. Through all the countless jokes, sneaky comments, and puns I've heard, this one caused the most laughs of all. But then @ PERSON1 moved to another city, @ CAPS2 was a sad day. The very next day, I heard the old saying, "@ CAPS2 once at gang camp ....", history and laughter were restored to my life. I learned something that day that friends moved me but the jokes that were told will always stick.

 It all started when my eighth grade class planned to go see a movie together. I had the idea to see a movie, so I picked out a few movies that were in theaters. The choices were between '@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2' @ CAPS3 from @ CAPS4 'and another movie that I don't remember. We, as a group, decided to go to @ CAPS3 of @ CAPS4. The movie stars @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS7 from @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9. I thought the movie was really good but there was a part in the movie that made me laugh so much. The scene begins with @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS7 wandering around trying to find a place to spend the night ; and they seemed to have @ CAPS4 @ LOCATION1; @ LOCATION1 plays an important role in the film. After a long day full of frightening situations, they find a good sized cave which they deem to be a good place to spend the night. Flashing back a bit, earlier today, and in the movie, @ PERSON1 ran into a native man named @ LOCATION1. @ LOCATION1 is a human-like creature who walked like an ape but has a human face but has a harry body all around. They met him on a trip through the desert and saved him from execution; for this, @ LOCATION1 is very grateful and @ CAPS11 guides around the mysterious @ CAPS3 which is alien to man and has never been seen by man. Going back to what I was talking about earlier, when @ PERSON1 and @ CAPS7 find themselves in the cave, they see two whole skeletons sitting at a table with an old record player on it, but the record is playing and making music. Just a second later, @ LOCATION1 walks into the frame of the stage and does a little dance that places him near, but in front of the table. Then, @ LOCATION1 performs several thrusts of the pelvis in different directions, mainly by working the air. Watching this scene made me laugh the hardest I've ever laughed in my life. To this day, I look back on it and laugh as hard as the first time I saw the movie. About a month later, I went to a good friend of mine and we watched the movie again. When we got to the scene of jig @ CAPS13, we both fell off the couch laughing. We replayed this scene ten more times and ended up crying because we were laughing so hard. Laughter is good for the soul and the morale, and for building friendship. Thank @ CAPS14 for making us laugh!

Laughs A true story involving @ CAPS4 and laughs was when I was hanging out with my @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, @ PERSON1 and her fiance @ PERSON4 (who is a professional quad racer) at a @ ORGANIZATION1 concert at @ LOCATION2 . The concert was the best concert I have ever attended and probably the best I will go to because @ ORGANIZATION1 is my favorite band. They even played the song that created them, it's called @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4. When we were there the music was really loud and a bunch of people were drinking and getting drunk and doing stupid stuff. Like this guy standing behind his girlfriend who was sitting in the grass, this guy had a little too much to drink. He was standing behind his girlfriend laughing at a joke one of his drunken buddies had told him, then he leaned on his girlfriend but fell on top of her and folded her in half like a garden chair. My @ CAPS1 and @ CAPS4 started to laugh, it was pretty funny. But then the guy's girlfriend got up and walked out of the stadium so he got pretty sad. The rest of the concert was pretty funny. The front row seats were reserved for people over @ NUM1 because during the concert the band would pull out beer guns and flood the front rows with beer. The first rows were the craziest rows. The back rows were pretty crazy too, people were smoking marijuana in the back rows, but we weren't. When we left we all smelled like weed and didn't want to be pulled over for whatever reason and made the cop think we were junkies. It was a long drive home, we live at @ LOCATION3, @ ORGANIZATION2 and we drove to @ LOCATION4, @ LOCATION2 and back in one day. I was so tired we didn't even take chairs for the gig so we had to stand in one place for about @ NUM2 hours. But it was worth it to see my favorite band in concert. They had a few other bands before them which were also great. Groups like ; @ PERSON2, @ CAPS5 / @ CAPS6 and @ CAPS7. So it was without a doubt the best concert I have ever attended. The second best gig I have ever attended was a @ CAPS8 concert at @ LOCATION1 with my @ CAPS9 @ PERSON3 and @ PERSON1 @ PERSON1 during @ CAPS10 @ CAPS11. There were a lot of things we did before the gig like; watch animals, eat, go for walks, buy things, eat more, have drinks and walk around @ CAPS11. Lots of things got @ CAPS4 laughing when my @ PERSON1 got into the horse and goat poo and my mom dropped her food on her lap. The gig was really cool, they played some songs from their new album @ CAPS12 and @ CAPS13. It was not as long as the drive to the @ ORGANIZATION1 concert and it was not as good. But it was still awesome.

                                                Laughter in @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 are all important elements in a person's life. Many are for making friends, for success, but above all for finding happiness. Everyone wants happiness in their life, right? The greatest form of happiness comes from your heart. Many believe that laughter comes from your heart and is supposed to make you and others really happy. An important part of making laughter important in a relationship would be optimism towards your partner and friends. It shows people that you are not just a pessimistic, rude, and unhappy person all the time. You can actually enjoy life and have a good time. After all, no one wants to date someone who is always negative and only looks at the wrong things. Your partner will be fed up with you and you will lose friends. Being able to laugh and joke around with people makes life a lot easier. That @ MONTH1 doesn't sound like much, but it does take some stress out of you if you have a good time and laugh out loud. Another reason why laughter is so important in a relationship would be the sound of your laughter. What if you had a boyfriend, our girlfriend, and they had never heard your laugh before and once they heard your laugh, they thought it was the most boring thing in the world? Studies show that they are more than likely to leave you. On that note, if you have a terribly boring laugh and that's the reason you don't want to laugh, I'll stick with the smile because we girls have some pretty cute smiles that keep us going. get away with a lot of fun. Finally, @ CAPS2 is another main part of laughter that is important in a relationship and that is happiness. You have to laugh to be happy. Without laughing what is a smile? Without laughing, how will happiness show through? Life can get pretty boring when all you do is act like a mime. No smile, no laugh, no fun ! When you laugh, it helps others laugh and have a good time. Plus, it's fun! Like when you laugh so hard that you cry or when you really need to go to the bathroom and it makes it worse when you start laughing out loud. Laughter creates memories. And memories are a very important part of growing up. So now that you've learned these three elements of why or how laughter is important in anyone's life, relationship, or friendship, go out there and laugh. It will make you feel much better. :)

 Hello my name is @ CAPS1 @ CAPS11, I am going to walk you through one of the most hilarious experiences I have ever had. This is a story about me @ CAPS11 my friends @ CAPS11 a little adventure we had @ DATE1, a day we will never forget. It starts off one of the most enjoyable days I have ever seen, I mean amazing blue skies, hot air @ DATE1, @ CAPS11 the sound of laughter coming from the kids playing in the streets. Me @ CAPS11 my three friends @ PERSON3, @ PERSON1, @ CAPS11 @ CAPS2 were sitting on my back porch in a circle playing our guitars, as usual @ CAPS11 we decided we had to do something, something new. As we sat down @ CAPS11 thought about what we could do, nothing came to my mind. Until @ PERSON1 offered to go to the beach @ CAPS11 met his cousin "@ CAPS3 has a nice house right on the beach @ CAPS11 probably wouldn't care if we stopped." @ CAPS3 said. The three of us looked at each other @ CAPS11 looked at a @ PERSON1 @ CAPS11 said "Let's go !" We packed our boards, our guitars, the food @ CAPS11 @ CAPS11 we left. Along the way we decided to go to the city skate park @ CAPS4, neither of us had ever been @ CAPS5. We drove for at least an hour looking for him. Aggravated @ CAPS11 about to give up looking for the park, we decided to take a loop @ DATE1 @ CAPS11 @ CAPS10 what happened. "@ CAPS5 is" shouted @ CAPS2 "@ CAPS5 is the park where I found it." We looked into the distance @ CAPS11 @ CAPS5 that was. The cradle, the snake's run, everything. we parked @ CAPS11 parked. We got out of the car ready to skate but out of nowhere it started to sink @ CAPS11 the park was soaked. we returned to the car looking for shelter to find that @ PERSON3 had locked his keys in the car. Luckily @ CAPS3 had @ CAPS7 so @ CAPS3 called them @ CAPS11 brought them in @ CAPS11 to unlock the car. it took them an hour @ CAPS11 and a half to find us @ CAPS11 unlocking the car. Now we were all crazy @ CAPS11 wondering if it was a good choice to take this trip. @ CAPS8 leaving the park, we decided it would be better that we go to the house of relatives of PERSON1 @ @ @ CAPS11 stayed during CAPS5 @ TIME1. When we received @ CAPS5 we were greeted with open arms @ CAPS11 warm clothes, "looks like you had a hard blow" @ CAPS3 said: "I'm @ PERSON2 I'm sure @ PERSON1 has you says it all about me now. " @ CAPS8, we changed for the clothes @ PERSON2 had given us, we went @ CAPS11 sitting by his fireplace to warm us up. The five of us sat down @ CAPS5 @ CAPS11 to talk for what seemed like an eternity. Then I said "I wish we could make a big fire on the beach". " We can " said @ PERSON2, " I know the perfect place ". @ CAPS3 took us to a little bay on the beach about @ NUM1 yards from her house, @ CAPS3 called her driftwood bay. "@ CAPS10, I told you I had the perfect spot." @ CAPS11 it was perfect, secluded, sandy, @ CAPS11 all the firewood you might need. We built a fire @ CAPS11 kept throwing wood at it until it exceeded @ NUM2 feet high. For the rest of the day @ CAPS11 until @ TIME1, we sat around the fire, playing our guitars in a circle, @ CAPS11 telling the story of our day. Laughing @ CAPS11 noticing that while the start of our day wasn't much fun, we closed it the only way we could have liked, sitting around a fire, music playing in @ TIME1, @ CAPS11 sharing a good laugh with your friends.

     Laughter is very important in a relationship in the opinion of @ CAPS4. Laughter can mean many things. It can mean that you are having fun and enjoying life. All @ CAPS4 friendships and relationships contain laughter. Half the time we laugh, the other half we express ourselves. Laughter can also mean the beginning or the end of a relationship. A lot of people would think that laughter is a happy reaction, but sometimes a person can laugh because they are nervous. But I think what we're talking about here is the happy kind. All @ CAPS4 friendships contain laughs, but they also contain times when someone needs to be listened to or heard. One of the @ CAPS4 friendships that contains a lot of laughs is with friend @ CAPS4 @ PERSON3. Since the day I first met her, we have laughed a lot. Usually @ PERSON3 is the wildcard and me is the audience with a few other people. But, there are also times when laughter is not involved. Times when @ PERSON3 can be a great listener. Joking and laughing can show how close you are to someone. Like friend @ CAPS4 @ PERSON2 and me. She is one of @ CAPS4's closest friends. We share everything between us, well at least almost everything. We tell each other what's going on in our families and all that good stuff. But there are so many moments that are just filled with laughs and laughs and jokes on @ CAPS5 knows what. Whether it's twisted in a weird way or even when it doesn't make sense, we always laugh about it. No matter how much @ MONTH1 I act with her, we always laugh about it and make fun of each other. Not in a bad way. Usually when people fall they feel embarrassed or scared of what everyone else would say. There was a time when I was sitting on a friend from @ CAPS4, @ PERSON4's skateboard, just sitting and rolling on the sidewalk, when I hit a bump. I'm sure you can guess what happens next. I took off the skateboard and landed on @ CAPS4's ass on the cement. I sat there for a second and just watched. Shocked that I flew off a skateboard as I sat down. Quite disappointing. But the next thing I knew, I was laughing, like it didn't even matter that I had just landed on @ CAPS4's butt, in front of one of @ CAPS4's friends. @ PERSON4 was laughing too. It didn't bother me. @ PERSON4 didn't even tease me about it. Laughter can make you forget things and help you make a joke out of them. That's what I did. The @ CAPS4 relationship with @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 is full of jokes. @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 is the kind of guy @ CAPS5 loves to tell jokes and / or act like a historical figure to confuse people. When I answer the phone half the time @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 try to see if I'm going to fall for one of his little things. He once tried to say he was @ PERSON1 and made up all these different electrical items. I shook @ CAPS4's head and said, "@ CAPS1, you're not very good at playing." @ CAPS2, he said, "I'm not your @ CAPS1. It's seriously @ PERSON1." I laughed and said "@ PERSON1 is dead. How could he talk to me on the phone when he's dead, @ CAPS1? I know it's you." @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 laughed, "@ CAPS5 told you I was dead? Obviously I'm still here, little lady." I smiled, "@ CAPS6 eh. Sure. And I'm not a little lady." "@ CAPS7 well, I give up. You can't be kidding, can you ?" , he said. I frowned, "Of course I can know what you're talking about, @ LOCATION1? It's just that you're not very good at acting." "@ CAPS7 of course blame me." , he laughed, "where is your mother?" That's when the joke ended of course, but @ CAPS4 @ CAPS1 and I actually have a strong relationship. He @ CAPS4 adopted @ CAPS1, in case it wasn't mentioned. So when I first met him, we weren't as close as you could probably guess. But after a year we got closer and I learned that I could trust him. And that half of what he's saying is basically a joke. Sometimes I wonder if he knows how to be serious, so as not to confuse people, me for example. For me, relationships should always have a laugh, otherwise it makes things serious. So it is very difficult to stay close, in the opinion of @ CAPS4. And I, myself, love to laugh and have close friends. Because when I'm feeling down it's always nice to have someone to make you smile and laugh. It's a great quality to be able to laugh and to help people. Without laughing in the world, like I said before, the world would be too serious, way too serious. @ CAPS5 would like it? I will not do it. It would be terrible. When people laugh, it makes the world a better place to live, according to @ CAPS4. Laughter is a gift, a very special gift.

 For me, laughter is someone who shows joy and excitement to others around them. Laugh @ MONTH1 sometimes be used in the wrong way, like @ CAPS1 someone to get hurt In any way, the other person laughs at them when @ CAPS2 hurts them. When I can make someone else laugh or laugh, @ CAPS2 not only fills me well, but the other person I was talking to as well. @ CAPS2 shows us both that we can be happy and that there is @ CAPS4 joy from us. I have a friend that I go to school with every day and he always looks so cranky and / or upset. And when someone asks him what's wrong or @ CAPS1, he's okay @ CAPS2 seems to get even more angry. So being one of his closest friends, I'm trying to help him with that, and so far @ CAPS2 has worked and I can make him happy by laughing and giving him a big smile. Whenever I see him in the hallway or even out of school, I will always say something to him to make him smile and laugh. And by the way, I'm showing him that I care about him and that he knows I don't want him to be cranky towards other people, we've developed a bond and we seem to spend a lot more time together. And by being in a better mood, @ CAPS2 makes her school day more fun and enjoyable, and for everyone else around her. @ CAPS1 I had to explain who I was, I would say I am a very happy person and respect others and express it and show it to others. Being happy brings joy to the other people around you, which is usually a laughing matter. Laughter is a very important part of your daily life and I think @ CAPS2 brings people together, so use @ CAPS2 don't be afraid.

 Laughter is important in any relationship because it brings two people together, connecting them between something they have in common forming an unbreakable bond between the two of them. Laughter is the glue that holds any relationship together and keeps a person from breaking down into tears when something goes wrong. come. In fact, without laughing, I probably wouldn't even manage to live my school life from day to day. Seriously, one class in particular would be a nightmare. In @ ORGANIZATION1 we dissect cats and we work with a partner, if I wasn't joking and laughing while I was working my partner and I would have hated each other. We were able to choose our partner and work in a lab station with another pair of students, luckily for me, I knew everyone I worked with and worked with, and was friends with all of them. we had to wear gloves and coveralls so as not to have liquids or "cat juice" on us. First of all we had to skin the cat, of course there is more than one way to do it, you can cut, slice, tear and pull to remove the skin. Then we had to see and identify the muscles, which was especially difficult because we couldn't tell where one muscle starts and another ends. Then we had to remove the muscles and identify the bones and digestive organs. After identifying the bones and digestive organs, we had to remove them and examine the stomach, liver, intestines and kidneys. We had to open up the stomach, intestines, and kidneys to look at the structure. finally, the heart and lungs had to be removed. The class was told that we have been doing dissections for about a month and it's only been three weeks. You can only imagine how horrible and fascinating it is and how much I need to laugh to stay together and not go crazy. My friends keep me from bursting into tears and make me laugh. Dissecting cats in @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 was a challenge not only physically, but also mentally. It's stressful, fascinating and disgusting, and without the jokes and laughs I don't think I would have ever made it. My friends supported me there when I needed it, it guided me through the terrible mission. So as you can clearly see, without laughing, I wouldn't be able to do some of the things that I do on a daily basis in school.

 A few years ago when I was in college, I met one of my best friends who I have a great time with. When I first met her, it was in math class where she had an assigned place next to me. We started talking and although we didn't know each other very well I could tell that laughter was the closest distance between her and me. We were just laughing at really random things happening because we didn't really know what to talk about. Sometimes it didn't make sense for what we were laughing at. But we laughed anyway even though we didn't understand other people's jokes. Laughing was something that kept our distance close. Time has passed and we have become good friends. Laughing was the only thing that brought us together because we had nothing better to do. We are both people who love to laugh a lot and otherwise we get bored. If I or she didn't have a sense of humor when we first met, I don't think we would have gotten along so well in the end. We really had nothing to do because we didn't know each other very well. We only hung out during lunch and any other classes we had together, but all we did was laugh at what we thought was funny, which was really stupid. We had nothing better to do. A few months later, we seemed to be becoming very close friends and not just laughing. We got to know each other a lot better and finally had things to say and found that we had something in common. Laughter still had something to do with our friendship, but not as much as when we first met. During math hour, we would always talk and laugh about the things we said. This had never happened before. But now we could also talk about other things, not just the things that made us laugh and we knew that laughter is not the only thing that keeps us together. Now we also had other ways of getting along. We both had friends who we could get along with differently. I had friends not very far away but we laughed a lot. With some of my other friends, I didn't really laugh much and we had a very close friendship. My friends and I can get along in different ways, not just in laughter. We all have different ways of getting along and having fun. Some of them are really calm and some of them like to laugh a lot like me. Most of the time, everyone is the type who likes to laugh all the time, but we are closer because of the way we are with each other. I think laughing could be the shortest distance between two people. There are other things that can keep two people close to each other. Laughter helps people have a great time together, but I don't think that's a big part of a friendship. I think that's how they get along and if they have things in common. It also depends on how they get along and how they treat each other. Everyone has a different way of keeping them close to a friend, so I think it's different for everyone.

One day while I was going to school with my friends I got into dog poo and all my friends laughed at me and it was so embarrassing and I was so angry that my shoes were dirty and now i had to come home and clean my shoes i just got for my birthday and now i had to tell my mom i had dog poop on my shoes and when i said my mom was not mad at me i think she is mad at me because she is working to get money to pay for my shoes. The next day I went to school, all my friends were laughing at me, I just went to my class and I sat and looked at my math work and when my best friend came up to me and told me you really get into dog poo and she gave a paper peace that had a dog pooping on a girl and i got so angry i started to cringe. When I got home from school mom asked me how school? I didn't used to tell her that my whole day was bad, everyone was laughing at me. So I just said school was good and she told me not everyone is good.

 Laughter seems to me to be the foundation of a relationship; whether it is a relationship with your parents, your best friend, or your spouse, it can all be a laugh or a giggle. I saw on @ CAPS1 that when a guy tries to 'hit on' or 'hit on' a girl, most of the time he's trying to be funny to 'break the ice'. When this so called "ice" is broken, the air is opened for the two people to begin to show who they are. My best friend and I have been friends for five years now and I hope we will be friends for years to come. @ PERSON1 (my best friend / and only friend) showed me how to be myself @ PERCENT1, with her and try to do it with others. Together @ PERSON1 and I have had many fun adventures together which I will cherish for the rest of my life. Just recently @ PERSON1 and I went snowboarding at @ LOCATION1 in @ LOCATION2. @ CAPS3 was his second time snowboarding and I've been snowboarding for about three years now. I promised her that I would stay to help her on the slopes until she grabbed the board under her feet, I also promised that I would fall with her when she fell. When we got there I showed him how to attach his bindings, what the pedal pad was for and also how to skate. The word skate means your boot is in the front binding and your left foot is not, you push your back foot over the snow to glide or skate to the ski lift. It took us three hours to descend the first slope of Bunny Hill, normally it doesn't take more than ten minutes for one person to descend. While teaching, laughing and bonding with @ PERSON1, I have noticed that when I laugh with her, I experience feelings of love, care and happiness. Laughing with her always makes my day. In fact, this is how we became friends; it was laughing together. After we got off the slope she said a few words to me that I won't forget : "@ CAPS2 you are the best friend I could ask for, if you were a man I would marry you and I would have your children, I love you. ” @ CAPS3 meant a lot to me, because @ PERSON1 is the kind of person who keeps their feelings of love and caring inside. @ CAPS3 was the first time she said she loved me. Laughing together for five years now has made @ PERSON1 feel more open with me, enough to say something she's never said to her family. Laughing and even laughing together is what @ PERSON1 and I look forward to in our relationship.

 I'm so good at making people laugh, @ CAPS8 is just one of my most impressive qualities. I have a lot of stories of when I make the maids laugh. I was going camping with some of my friends once and looked out the window and saw a sign. "@ CAPS1 stops, unless" @ CAPS2 "is an" @ CAPS3 "@ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 must be @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4." I said. @ CAPS8 was so funny I made everyone in the car laugh. @ CAPS7 Later on our way to camp with my friends, we stopped at @ CAPS5 in a town. When we pulled up there I got into a basket and my friends and I ran around the islands and the maid all the other patrons laughed. When we were going to leave, I bought a whole bunch of food. When we were back inside the car, I grabbed the box of donuts I had bought and let everyone in the car have one. We all started eating them and we had established that the donuts were really gross. The donuts tasted so dry @ CAPS8 looked like they didn't even have frosting on them. I opened my chocolate milk and had to drink my chocolate milk with my donut just to make @ CAPS8 taste a little sweeter. Neither of us ran out of donuts. @ CAPS8 was so funny we threw the donuts out the window. On the way back from the camp we had been to my friend @ PERSON1 was driving home and I sat behind him and played with him so much. I had cranked my phone to its highest volume and played a scary ringtone and scared him and blew him up. @ CAPS7 I had licked my finger and put @ CAPS8 in his ear @ CAPS7 he panicked, because he thought @ CAPS8 was really gross. After that he opened his window and I opened mine and put my hand around and grabbed his arm and scared him. @ CAPS7 we had stopped at the store in a small town and soda god and bought a soda to drink. When we got back in the car and left I said, "@ CAPS6 didn't stop, just opened a beer. Haha." @ CAPS7 I had a glass of my soda and while I was drinking the glass I started laughing again and some of my soda went up my nose @ CAPS7 I said: "@ CAPS8 is burning so much. My nose is burning me. " We were all laughing. The irony is that thirty minutes after I said we were arrested. We were driving on the freeway and my driving friend @ PERSON1 thought the speed limit was sixty-five miles per hour but the speed limit was fifty-five. The cop arrested him and made him seventy-five. I was going to try and make the cop laugh, to see if we could enlighten him a bit, but my friend @ PERSON1 said no because he was so angry. He ended up getting a ticket and the cop was a complete jerk. He looked at the license plate and @ CAPS7 turned around and asked @ PERSON1 if they were @ LOCATION1's plates, when they clearly said @ LOCATION1 right on it. Everyone in the car laughed so hard @ CAPS8 was hilarious. The cop was really stupid. I @ CAPS6 don't think anyone who came with me to camp this weekend has stopped laughing. I'm so good at making people laugh, @ CAPS8 is just one of my most impressive qualities.

 Laughter ... what is laughter? Do you expect me to tell you what laughter is? I wish I could but I can't describe laughter is like describing the taste or feel of water (besides using the word wet) it's just one of those things you think that's easy to describe to someone because it's part of your day-to-day life, but in reality, it's one of the most complex things that can exist. Even though I can't describe it, I have a general concept of it. Now there are many reasons to laugh or the type of laughter or the feeling behind it. In my case, I believe I am a person that @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 laughs at once a day. I laugh all the time about my friend falling, hearing a joke, remembering something in the past, just plain exhaustion (yes, I laugh @ CAPS1 times when I'm so exhausted and stressed out), the list goes on and on. In short, I live my life of laughing every day. I don't think I'm such a happy and lucky person who makes others laugh by his side, but I have received comments from my friends that I do. It's one of the wonders of laughing if you see someone laughing while making the most of their time, you end up laughing next to them. It makes me happy when I hear a friend of mine say "oh @ PERSON1 you just had my day ..." why? That makes me happy because I know that this friend earlier I could have had even a bit of a beautiful day. Once in my life I met someone, someone who is now very dear to me, someone with whom I just cannot imagine my life without whom someone would be right to say that he has lost his laughter. It was @ DATE1, and my friend @ CAPS3 had invited me to @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 in @ CAPS6 to meet some of her friends @ CAPS4. The reunion with his friends was @ CAPS1 this cafe. I didn't know anyone other than her so I felt out of place. So after sitting down like a wall flower, I decided to go to the ice cream shop right next to the cafe and when I realized that one of the boys in our group decided to come too. We hung out, he told me about himself, I told him about me too. After that day we stayed connected, we had long hours of chatting through this video calling site called @ ORGANIZATION1. We chatted in @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 everyday and spent whole nights on the phone just talking to each other. After about a month of talking and keeping in touch, we became closer, close enough that he could discuss more serious matters with me. Well now this dear boy has had such a difficult life. Where can I start to tell you about the trials he went through. Oh, what about her adoptive ... hhmmm nah, a lot of people are adopted, it's not that hard for most. Okay, what about the fact that his adoptive dad abused him whenever he got the chance and his adoptive mom literally sat down and watched him do it, not enough? Good ? Okay, what about the fact that the one thing that made him hold his friend, the one that was right next to him. Its to say childhood friends, the childhood friend you can make @ CAPS9 in the world but wouldn't judge, wouldn't think the worst of you if you did something you are ashamed of, whoever was ready to stay with you for days straight just so you don't cry to fall asleep. This friend of his died in a recreational car during his sophomore year of college. His life consisted of waking up in the morning walking to school and being ignored by everyone around him. Coming home from school and supporting your adoptive family by shouting @ CAPS1 at him, he insulted him and ended up being beaten up just because they can. Do you think he laughed? Well, he actually did, but his laugh was not a laugh of joy. Even though he was laughing, it was as if nothing sensed what was behind that laughter, a robotic laugh. It is such a difficult thing for me to bear. It tears me apart because this person is a very dear person to me, he is such a wonderful individual that he is now part of my life and I cannot see him come out of it now. Yet he is in pain, he cannot even laugh and feel joy. To this day I still see him and decided that one day I would surely make him laugh. We laugh when we speak, but I want him to experience the laughter he hasn't experienced yet and I know that someday he will.

 When I think of laughter, you think of the memories you have shared with people. When I was about six, my family and I went to the ranch of my cousins to @ Organization1. The happiest moment started when we pulled up to the house as I slowly opened my eyes after the long drive to see the porch light come on. I quickly grabbed all my toys and a few playing cards and waited impatiently at the door for some to answer while the rest of my family collected the suitcases. My @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 came to the door first to greet us. I pass under his arm to put my toys in the living room when I saw @ PERSON1 sleeping in the bus. He was my best friend in the world and I always looked forward to seeing him every time. He had brown hair still wearing wranglers with a trucker cap and his bib tucked into his shirt. We always played goldfish together whenever I came, any time of the day. I was so excited to see him I started running towards him when my other cousin @ PERSON2 grabbed me and started tickling me saying I fell to the floor and was screaming laughing. My laughter woke @ PERSON1 as he came running up to me, lifted me off the ground and saved me from @ LOCATION1. He put me on the couch and started watching @ CAPS3 say I'm falling asleep. The next morning I woke up to hear cyotes howling outside as the sun rose, when I smelled bacon and eggs coming from the kitchen I got up to have breakfast. My father and all the boys went goose hunting on the farm. Around lunchtime, while my mom and @ PERSON3 were making burgers, the boys all came back in time for lunch. Lunch wasn't ready then so @ PERSON1 and I started playing goldfish to say that we were told it was time to eat. After lunch we went to the hay barns to find all the rattlesnakes and bull snakes curled up by the balls. Almost with every step we took there was another snake curled up in the balls. Every time @ PERSON1 told me to jump back and shoot the snake in the head. After chasing @ PERSON1 we thought we needed a laugh so he grabbed a bull snake and we started walking to the backyard. I wasn't sure what he was doing when we entered the back yard and @ PERSON3 jumped out of his chair and started running towards the house. Everyone laughed when @ PERSON1 cut her off and she was running around in the back yard. @ PERSON1 finally let her into the house after about five minutes of giving her a heart attack. We all came back inside to visit the house. @ PERSON1 and I headed for more goldfish at the table for the last time in my visit. The next morning, we woke up at five o'clock to start working on the farm. I fell back to sleep in the tractor to say they were done. When we were done we started loading all the clothes into the car and hugged everyone as I stood next to @ PERSON1 not wanting to leave but my mom said I couldn't stay so she came to get me and put me in the car. As we walked away, I turned to see them all say goodbye to us. After visiting @ DATE1 we got a call from my @ CAPS4 @ PERSON3 with some bad news. @ PERSON2 was driving home and saw the @ CAPS5 truck on the road, but when he pulled over he saw he had committed suicide two weeks before he graduated. We went to the funeral this @ DATE2 and when everything was done I sat in the @ CAPS5 room and could only remember all the laughs we shared. I always knew how to laugh and always remember the good times I had with a real my best friend. My memory of him hasn't faded after all these years and because of him I always laugh when I can laugh and live fully. He's taught me so much in his short time, but whenever I need to laugh I think about the last time I saw him.

I think laughter is one of the most important things people have to do in life. The more you laugh in life it makes it so much better and easier. It is better to laugh at something that is bad, like falling by someone or even making a simple mistake. It makes life not that difficult and simpler and easier. Laughter can make people happy and enjoy things better and maybe help them anticipate things in the future and help them conquer the things they want to do in life. One thing that always makes me laugh is my family and friends. They make me easier while making me laugh. They don't always say the smartest or funniest thing in the world, but it means a lot to me that they do. Especially when I'm not feeling upset or in a good mood, they say something that will make me laugh and I usually feel a lot better knowing that they made me laugh to make me feel good again. Most simple things make me laugh more and be happy. Like if someone says something totally stupid and knows someone else is laughing besides me. But one thing that normally doesn't make me laugh is if someone is seriously injured, as if they were tripping. I wouldn't laugh at that because I wouldn't want someone to laugh at me if I fell and hurt myself. I always hate when people brag about things that know other people know what happened to them, like when they talk about what they did during @ DATE1 and how great they have become " high ”or“ drunk ”. It's really annoying for me and also very unnecessary because when they talk about it I never pay attention or I just walk away because it all annoys me a lot. Why would I wanna hear how you're wasting your life? Especially at a young age, or even not at all. Well this is my story and why I think the benefits or the laugh is important.

 They say laughter is the best medicine @ CAPS15 I personally think it's true. For one jokes are a good thing for a laugh, but sometimes it depends on the joke because some jokes are extremely funny @ CAPS15 some or @ CAPS14 just awful. Another reason laughter is awesome @ CAPS5 is when your laughter automatically means you're in a good mood @ CAPS15 i like being happy or in a good mood i hate being all angry @ CAPS15 upset @ CAPS14 it's not me. I @ CAPS14 I love it when I can't breathe I laugh @ CAPS5 loud these are the best jokes too you @ CAPS11 about getting wet especially if you are extremely ticklish @ CAPS15 I know quite a few people who are @ CAPS15 I sorry for them because I would be really embarrassed if I got wet in front of someone. All my life has been laughing for me at all times, it's laugh time. Well i have quite a few laughing stories but i am only going to tell you one @ CAPS15 this is one of my favorites is when me @ CAPS15 my friends all hang out at mt grandmas for my birthday party @ NUM1 @ CAPS15 were all having a good time on the house slip @ CAPS15 drag the food @ CAPS15 the drinks (big soda no alcohol).

 We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter is definitely the most important part of my relationship between me and my best friends. Without laughing, we wouldn't be able to have as much fun as we do. If I'm having a bad day, I can always count on my best friend to crack me up and forget about the day I had. Whether we're outside or just relaxing at home, my best friend and I are always laughing. The end result is usually the two of us with tear-streaked faces from laughing so hard. There are actually quite a few different cases where I remember laughing a lot. This last day before @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 for example, it started snowing around 3am, so my best friend and I ran outside screaming at the top of our lungs. Snowballs started coming from all directions. During a game of hide and seek, we decided to bury ourselves in a pile of leaves covered in snow. In less than ten minutes, our legs were frozen. So what did we do? We put on our swimsuits and jumped in the tub together. Having him there to laugh with me made the situation a lot better. Another situation that I remember being particularly funny in was the entire third trimester of first year @ CAPS2. I needed a first class and the only thing open was the intro to crafting. I really wasn't looking forward to it, until I found out my best friend had it with me. We made a bad situation a lot better by laughing at every stupid mistake we made. Since we are not exactly experienced in metalwork, there were quite a few mistakes. Without my best friend there to laugh with me, I have no idea what I would have done. I believe that whenever I am in a bad situation, laughter will always help me. One last situation where laughter helped me a lot was when I used it to cheer up my best friend. A few days ago my friend had a really bad day. Things just weren't going his way. After school I could tell something was wrong. I tried talking to her about it, but it didn't really help. So, I mentioned some of our past experiences together. Within minutes she was laughing and I could tell she was feeling a lot better. Laughter really helps us out of some difficult situations. Laughter is by far the most important factor in the relationship between my best friends and me. Our relationship is mainly based on laughter. Without it, we just wouldn't be as close as we are today. Whether we need it to cheer us up or cure boredom, I know laughter will always be on our side.

      It was midsummer and I could feel the cool ocean breeze sweeping over my skin. You would think everything would be calm, but it was exactly the opposite. I didn't want to talk to him or even look at him. He was trying so hard to make me laugh but I just couldn't. I was so mad at him that I thought nothing between us would ever be the same again. I thought our three months together were over, and it scared me so much. He left for his trip the next day, and he left without saying a word. I fell asleep crying for a week. I knew he was back in town already, but he hadn't called me or said anything. After weeks of questioning and waiting, I could feel it was over. I spoke to my sister and she told me that he would be back and that I had to be patient. I tried to take his words into my heart and wanted to believe it was true. I called his house every night, but every night I got the same response, "he's not home, but I'll let him know you called." I wanted to believe I would hear from him, so to pass the time I would take care of housekeeping and going out with my family. A few days without thinking and worrying about him made me feel good. I smiled and laughed again. I felt like I could start to breathe a little and have fun. My sister's advice ended up working because a week later he called me and said he wanted to see me. I told him he could come by @ DATE1 and that I was very excited to see him again. The call ended and I was smiling ear to ear. The next two days, I was completely crazy, I cleaned everything, I looked for what I was going to wear. Everyone thought I was going crazy, but the truth is, I was scared. Afraid of what he will tell me, and where we would go from here. The days seemed to pass and the next thing I knew he was knocking on my door. I let him in and he took me by surprise with a big hug. We spent hours talking and listening to music. It was as if nothing had ever changed. Before we knew it it was dark and he was leaving. I walked him to the front of my trailer park and he made me sit on the sidewalk and took my hand. I was shocked and didn't know what to do other than listen. He told me he was sorry for the way he acted and that tonight he realized how much he wanted to be with me, and that he was completely in love with me. I couldn't do anything other than cry and laugh at the same time, and soon enough he was laughing with me. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect time. It's been six months since @ TIME1. We're better than ever because we have a laugh. This is what helps keep our relationship strong, and it keeps us close. Everyone needs a little laughter in their life. I'm glad I found someone special enough to always make me laugh. It is as if we have never stopped. If you ever feel hopeless and like there is nothing for you. Remember to laugh, that's what makes the world go round.

 Have you ever had a time with your friends or family where you laughed so hard that you had a stomach ache and your eyes filled with tears ? Laughing is something that every person needs. A good laugh can make a people day and put a smile on their face. If no one was laughing, the world would be a terribly sad place. My friends and I are always laughing, to the point of rolling over on the floor, hugging our stomachs and laughing. Sometimes we laugh for absolutely nothing. Honestly, I don't know who I would be if I didn't laugh, or what would become of me. I remember one time when my friends @ CAPS1 and @ PERSON1 and I were on vacation. We all woke up in a bad mood and everything seemed to be going wrong, especially since we were woken up by my mom in the kitchen banging on pots and pans. When we woke up our favorite cereal was gone so we wanted to go to the donut store but no one took us, and although I realize it's not the end of the world now it was like that at the time. My brother and sisters, with the @ LOCATION1 blasting and running all over the house screaming annoyed us and we were already angry. The dog and cats, who were trying to sneak into the house, annoyed us too. The weather outside was gloomy and disappointing. We were all ready to make the day before it even started. We finally decided to get up and get ready. We made a plan to go down to the river behind my house, even in bad weather. The river was after our large backyard and past the quad trail so it was about a mile and a half away. When we asked my mom if we could go down to the river she said no she didn't want us to go down alone which we had done several times before. We begged until we knew she wouldn't let us. It put us in a bad mood once again. We had to go and find something new to do and there didn't seem to be a lot of options. We lived out of town about @ NUM1 miles, not exactly within walking distance.

 I woke up like any other day happy but sleepless. Getting out of bed, I would never have known that today would be the funniest day of my life. I got ready for school after getting out of bed. When I got to school it all seemed like our normal coming home, there was an announcement on the intercoms that told everyone out of nowhere that there was a dance that evening. So after school my friends and I would go to our house to dress up for the dance. After we were all dressed, @ PERSON1 picked us up and we headed for the dance watching the fly. When we got there everyone looked dressed to dance except one guy, he was wearing corduroy pants with a red tucked in flannel and worn brown work boots. We look at it from head to toe and thought we were in a messed up hillbilly dream? This was only the beginning of what was yet to come. As everyone started to enter the rhythm grove, we soon all started dancing to the music, the music was good and everyone was having fun, even the kid with the flannel. But just when everything was going well a song came up called Cotton Eyed @ CAPS1 when the flannel kid heard this song he almost jumped out of his cord pants he quickly started kicking of foot and swinging his feet and arms as if they had no bones or joints in them. Everyone started to circle around the child and everyone was laughing and copying the children's movement, even us. He didn't care, he just kept dancing and singing to the song. The funniest thing about it was that the dancing was formal and yet this kid managed to get away with flannel, boots and a pair of corduroy pants. this day.

 Laughter is an important part of my life, either my friends make me laugh or I make them laugh. A great example is the @ DATE1 me @ PERSON1 three of my closest friends have gone hunting. This trip was the worst @ PERSON1 hunting experience of my life. it was the worst because we shot @ PERSON1 missed two bears @ PERSON1 one of the biggest dollars of my life. But it was the best because we all got into that tired state where every little thing was funny. The trip turned out to be a failure, but the most important thing was we had a great time, @ CAPS1 teens riding around in a van making each other laugh. Another example was a @ DATE1 this @ DATE2 me @ PERSON1 two boat loads of my friends went to a nearby fishing hole called @ ORGANIZATION1 @ NUM1 is a small @ ORGANIZATION1 quiet where not many people go, it is very peaceful. I took out my fifteen foot duck / fishing boat @ PERSON1 my ten foot canoe. I was controlling the big boat, the only boat with a @ PERSON1 motor towing behind us was the canoe. Inside the canoe was @ PERSON1 two kids who don't want to be funny but you can't help but laugh at them. We had a good @ DATE1 fishing @ PERSON1 it was starting to end. On the way back we stopped to secure a pole @ PERSON1 the slack in the rope pulling the canoe became slack. When we started moving again, the release tightened @ PERSON1, the canoe swerved forward unbeknownst to @ PERSON1, who was standing at the time. almost knocked him down. @ PERSON1 when I mean almost I mean the only thing left in the boat was his feet @ PERSON1 his hands which were holding on to the side rail. The only part that was in the water was her buttocks. This turned out to be the highlight of the @ PERSON1 trip we still talk about from time to time. My friends @ PERSON1 I have a lot of adventures, most of them turn out bad, but all of them turn out funny.

 I sat at the table, speechless, as they told me their story. The @ CAPS1 has been through a lot in the past seven years. @ PERSON1's youngest son was born three weeks earlier and the doctor told him he would only live three days at most. As she told me, she looked into the distance as if reliving the moment. She told me that her baby, @ PERSON2, had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the normal stiffness. She told me about those early days and how scared she was. Seeing @ PERSON2 next to her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears. He had lived longer. @ PERSON1 explained to me that as I got older, @ PERSON2 could no longer walk. Her pediatrician told her that @ PERSON2 would never be able to take her first steps and would have to live confined to a wheelchair. @ PERSON2 received another miracle. He walked. Using a camouflage cane, he beat all odds again. @ PERSON1 explained to me that @ PERSON2 could not speak. He speaks only through sign language. She also taught me to take care of him. He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @ CAPS2. He was no different from the rest of the kids. It was going to be a weeklong roller coaster. I had only met @ CAPS1 at the start of @ TIME1 when they arrived at @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5, a @ DATE1 @ CAPS4 for children with disabilities. I had only known them for a few hours and they told me their life story. I had the next week to become @ PERSON2's best friend. We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, took nature walks and even rode horses. The smile on @ ORGANIZATION1's face brightened my day every time I saw him. @ PERSON2 was able to experience things that a child of his kind could never do in his life. We were able to tubing, jet skiing, and fishing in a pond where we were sure to catch something. Having the best time of our lives, we went our separate ways each night to go to bed, him in his cabin and I in my tent. Every night as I left I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day had been and how much fun we were having. Being part of a child's happiness was the icing on the cake of my @ CAPS4 experience. One particular event from @ CAPS4 that week will always stay in my heart. @ PERSON2 had experimented on a tricycle specially designed for disabled children. He tried for hours to get him to go. No matter how hard she tried, he couldn't move. My heart broke when I saw him cry. He was so frustrated. @ PERSON2 gave up and went to the swings instead. The rest of the day was filled with sadness and frustration on his face. I wanted to fix it. I had to fix it. He needed to be happy. That night I went to our manager @ CAPS4, @ PERSON3, and told him what had happened and he took me to the garage. The garage was so chaotic and disorganized. I wasn't quite sure what he was doing until he came out with a shiny brand new bike. One with foot straps and a full support seat with dragons and a bell. It was the perfect thing. I was so excited to let @ PERSON2 try it out in @ TIME1. The next @ TIME1, after a delicious breakfast of blueberry pancakes, we went to try out the new toy. This moment was important for @ PERSON2 and his parents. He was told that he would never walk, that he would never be able to ride a bike or speak. He had already experienced miracles. He could do it again. @ PERSON3 strapped @ PERSON2 to the bike, put a helmet on him and started him. The wait was almost too great. After a few seconds, the wheels started to turn. @ PERSON2 was riding a bike. Tears were streaming down our faces, it was the greatest moment in @ ORGANIZATION1's life. The way he smiled and laughed at his newfound abilities was a tremendous sight. To be a part of something so special was an honor. @ PERSON2 rode all around @ CAPS4 that day. He even got him into his cabin and continued to circle around his bunk. I left the family to enjoy their night and I went for bed myself. The rest of the week was a lot of fun, but in the end it was a tough farewell. We didn't want to leave each other. I was now part of the @ LOCATION1 family, they trusted me and I felt at home with them. @ PERSON2 and I were new best friends and we couldn't wait for the next @ DATE1 when we would meet again at @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 where we could do it all over again and make some new memories.

 If I remember correctly it was @ DATE1. It was a hot and humid day. I remember that day like it was yesterday. I woke up that morning and decided to go swimming. But the only problem was that I didn't have anyone to go with me, and @ CAPS2's attitude was turning for the worse. The day @ CAPS1 went pretty well for the most part. I called all of the @ CAPS2 friends to see what they were doing that day, but as I walked down the @ CAPS2 friend line everyone seemed to be too busy to go anywhere with it. me. I was most certainly disappointed. @ CAPS2 happy go lucky attitude turned into a dumping ground very quickly. The only thing left for me to do was to use the @ CAPS2, @ CAPS2 aunt backup plan. We gathered our swim gear, blankets, tanning lotion and ourselves and packed it in the back of the van and headed over to @ ORGANIZATION1. I really wasn't in the best of moods, and it seemed like everyone around me was getting cranky as well. Totally disappointed that all of the @ CAPS2 friends had abandoned me and left me hanging out with aunt @ CAPS2 all day long, that wasn't a fun explanation from @ CAPS2, sorry to say, but it was not the case. As the day progressed, the more I thought about my @ CAPS2 friends, the more frustrated I became. Then finally it occurred to me, why let their stupidity of giving up (the best thing that ever happened to them) ruin my day @ CAPS2. I @ CAPS1 laughing and having a good time, and real quick I actually forgot why I was having a bad day. When we got to our swimming hole, I looked around and noticed that everything was fine. Everyone was having fun there. So I @ CAPS1 to relax and have a good time. Jump rocks, make a fool of myself, laugh and have a good time. We spent the whole day enjoying what we had. When I got home and realized how great the day at @ CAPS2 had been, I realized that I shouldn't let my friends at @ CAPS2 bring me down. Laughing and having a good time can make any day better. The most important lesson I learned from the @ CAPS2 experience that day is to make the most of every situation. Don't let shattered plans crush your confidence. Put a smile on your face and reverse your frown and laugh. laughter makes life better.

 Those eyes, it was like watching a warm Caribbean sunset with a flash of green while relaxing on the beach without worrying about the world. Her skin was ablaze with the sun and flawless in every way. Those lush ruby red lips were as juicy and refreshing as the taste of a freshly picked pink apple. From the moment she sat down across from me, I could have sworn I was dreaming. How can a woman look so perfect and exist outside of a movie or a game ? It's all I could think of, it's all I wanted to imagine. Just me and her together, but the idea that it was too great to come true, I couldn't find a way to bridge this gap I felt between us. None of us had ever met or seen before and yet I still couldn't resist. it was like when adam received the golden apple from the day before. That smile, those perfectly straight teeth with that sparkling shine that could blind anyone without sunglasses. That's when she finally spoke up and said "@ CAPS1, do you know the answer to number three ?" I was stunned by his voice. It reminded me of a thousand violins played by angels. my mouth dropped and all I could say was "no". I was a complete mook nothing more than a shoemaker, but noticed she was wearing a cross to match her outfit. So I tried to redeem myself with "it is an incredible cross that you wear, what kind of jewel is it in the center?". She smiled and fluttered her eyelashes and said "thank you, I love your cross too. Mine has a ruby in it". I smiled back and then got a text from my friend with a new joke he wanted me to hear. As I read it, I started to laugh. The angel in front of me was then curious to know what I was laughing at. When I finally finished the joke she too burst out laughing and I finally gave myself a good introduction and told her my name. She was smiling ear to ear after the laughter we heard and told me her name was "@ CAPS2". Ah @ CAPS2 surly, that must have been a name given to the angels. To this day, I still thank my friend who played this joke on me, because if I hadn't made her laugh, we probably wouldn't have gotten to know each other. If we hadn't gotten to know each other, she probably wouldn't be my girlfriend. To this day, I still feel like the luckiest man in the world and if fate sees fit to part us, I will always remember that laughing is the best way to get to know someone.

Some say that laughter is the common language among people, nation to nation. If this is true, these laughs can speak any language in the world. In our lives, we all need to laugh. When they laugh, they are not only benefiting themselves, but also all the people around them. sad because @ CAPS1 is crying. Same as laughing @ CAPS1 is happy because @ CAPS1 laughs ! I remember once when I was in college, everyone in my class had to go on stage and do the presentation. Before the presentation started, everyone was silent and no one was speaking because we were all nervous. The classroom was completely silent @ CAPS1 could even hear a pen drop. I sat down on my desk and didn't know what to do. I was so alert I thought I was going to pass out in any second. I thought that was what my friends thought too. Suddenly we all heard a kid laughing! I didn't know what he was laughing at, but everyone started laughing! @ CAPS1 could sense that Neverous' situation was gone ! Everyone started talking and walking around. It helped me assert myself. I felt the big, heavy thing that was on my shoulder suddenly disappear! The story was so unforgettable because I realized how much a laugh can turn a situation from bad to good. Laughter could turn the whole world from dangerous to peace. I am a laugh. I like to laugh because when I laugh, I feel like everything is better. It can be both positive and negative, but the dose of laughter makes my life better. The people around me think I'm fun to be with because they can feel the joy that I bring to them. Laughter is an important part of a relationship. My friend and I, when we get together we always laugh at everything from any house to heaven. We really have fun together. There was a time I wondered, what does nobody in my group laugh when we're together? It wouldn't be fun anymore! Without laughter, the distance between my friends and I would be a big gap, but with laughter, we wouldn't have any distance between us! Then I noticed the other group of people. Maybe they just had a bad day, they didn't have any smiles on their faces. When they were seated together, no one spoke or laughed during lunch hour. They seemed to be no longer friends. After dys, they started talking again. They laughed like they were good together! I realized that laughter could change everything. It could change not only the interior of the relationship, but also the way people view your relationship. Laughter helps us a lot. Mentally, physically and socially, they benefit us in our lives.

 Laughter is an integral part of many situations. These situations are very diverse, from disasters to wanting to be cheerful to just wanting to have fun. Humor can shed light on circumstances, however dire, terrifying or unpleasant they may be. The recent earthquakes and the ensuing tsunami at @ LOCATION2 worried me a lot for my friend @ CAPS1. He lives at @ LOCATION1 that me at the time, me and a lot of my other friends, thought I was close to some of the worst affected areas. Of course, we were all scared for him, but we tried our best to shed light on this disaster. Our fears were even worse when he never logged into ning or facebook, but now we know it was simply because the power was cut for him that night (night for us). When we found out he was safe, at least for now, we were all incredibly relieved. The humor really helped defuse the situation, as it has done several times before. For now, this is still a story in the making because at the time of writing there are still great dangers to this region, not least of which is the threat of nuclear fusion. The jokes continue into the week. I believe humor can be very helpful during times of worry, because taking a serious situation lightly in a certain way makes it feel less serious. Of course, a lot of people despise this, which is quite understandable. They don't see that we are legitimately afraid or don't understand and believe that we are just joking about it to be " pissed off " or " offensive ." People who feel the need to joke about dangerous situations do not intend to be malicious or indifferent, more often than not, they are people with a sense of humor and a sense of helplessness.

Once I was at my friend's house @ PERSON1 and her dog @ PERSON3 was going crazy. She was going up and down the stairs as fast as she could and no one knew why. I thought it was so funny, but @ PERSON1 was getting very angry with @ PERSON3. So finally @ ORGANIZATION1 in her room to see if she would calm down, but to her dismay @ PERSON3 didn't. She was warming back and forth around the room and the more she did that, the louder I laughed. It was like the funniest thing I have ever experienced in my life. This dog had obviously got his hands on some kind of power source to make this happen. Yet we still couldn't figure out what it was, but @ PERSON3 had high sugar or something. So @ PERSON1 and I went down the stairs to see if his mom @ CAPS1 knew why @ PERSON3 was acting so ridiculously. She had no idea. So we went to ask his dad @ PERSON2, and he was convinced the dog was just crazy. Obviously the dog was having issues, but that was not the issue as @ PERSON3 had never done this before. Then @ CAPS2, @ PERSON1's sister came down the stairs and told us to shut up the dog, but we couldn't. @ PERSON3 was running too fast to catch up with her and was way too crazy to try to calm her down. So we took @ PERSON3 back to @ ORGANIZATION1's room and just laughed and laughed because there was nothing else to do but sit there and wonder what was wrong with this dog. To be honest, we never found out what was wrong with @ PERSON3, she was just insanely hyper and out of this world than @ TIME1. So after @ PERSON3 calmed down about @ NUM1 hours later, @ PERSON1 and I went for a walk. We were with her friend @ PERSON4 and I was trying to explain to her how @ PERSON3 went crazy than @ TIME1 and they didn't find him as funny as I did. I thought it was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life! And while I was explaining to him, they warned me that I was about to trip on a sidewalk, but I was laughing too hard to notice and I fell. It was like the icing on the cake of @ TIME1. I just sat on the floor and laughed, and so did they. It was quite funny! I haven't laughed so much since. The end.

 LAUGH @ CAPS1 knows that laughter is a curative medicine. It has the power to relieve many aches and pains, like the hole in someone's heart after a break-up or the suffering of someone unable to support their family. However, the kind of painful, assuaged laughter in my life was the pain of losing a dear friend and teacher. Recently one of the best teachers I had the chance to know passed away. He was trying to enter @ ORGANIZATION1 to set up his lesson plans for @ TIME1, when the fatal incident occurred. <@ NUM1 </ @ CAPS2> had a doctor's appointment that day and got a replacement to replace him. It was six o'clock in @ TIME1 and it was still dark as @ PERSON2 tried to open the doors of @ ORGANIZATION1. Before he knew it, he was on the floor waiting for someone to come and help him. Finally, @ PERSON1, the janitor, came out, spotted him and quickly called @ NUM2. The ambulance rushed to pick him up and rushed him to hospital for emergency treatment. As soon as they got there, they found out he had had a heart attack. He had had a few minors before this one. However, this heart attack was significant. It took his life and they couldn't resuscitate him. @ PERSON2 was declared dead on the day of @ DATE1. Our principle was for an emergency meeting when we had all arrived at @ ORGANIZATION1 than @ TIME1. We knew something was wrong, considering the strange looks on all of our teachers' faces. All the students gathered in the small gymnasium of our @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1. The air was filled with impatience as we waited for something to happen. After a while, a man we all knew walked out in front of us with a microphone in his hand. With slumped shoulders and grim face, @ PERSON3, our principle, shared the tragic news with us. My mouth opened and I gasped. I could hear people adjust to their seats and whisper to each other as they struggled to absorb the devastating news. Looking around I saw the same shocked expressions on @ CAPS1 of the faces of my classmates. I did not know what to do. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't yet. @ PERSON3 explained the situation in more detail as we listened intently to the sickening words that came out of his mouth. I was shocked. I didn't believe @ PERSON2 was gone. After our principle finished speaking, we were led out of the gymnasium by melancholy teachers and told to report to our first period class. As I walked over to my locker, I heard sobs, but it was mostly silent. I quickly grabbed the folder for my first class and closed the locker, wanting to exit the hallway and enter a more private space. As I entered the classroom, I sat down at my desk. People in my class came in through the door and took their seats as well. Our teacher for this class didn't speak to us, so we assumed we weren't doing anything. Sitting there in silence and feeling helpless, I put my head on my desk and started to cry. It really happened, I thought. The reality of @ TIME1 was setting in. By the end of the first period, my sweatshirt sleeve was wet with tears and mascara. No one really said anything, but it was okay. Seeing that I had cried, people stopped to give me a hug as I slowly walked down the hall to my second class. I expected my next class to look a lot like the first, but it wasn't. Instead of the cold silence, was the sweet sound of music. Instead of crying on their own, people were comforted by friends. The students made cards for @ PERSON2's family. We all remembered the great times we had with @ PERSON2. We told the stories he told us about his life in the classes he taught. We remembered the funny crackle he had in his voice when he lifted her in the smallest way. We laughed when we remembered that he couldn't hang up anything directly and the evidence was on the walls of his classroom. For the first time in this already long day, we felt good. We felt like we could celebrate her life, not mourn her. The rest of the day went well. Not because we lost a great teacher, but because we could love and appreciate a great teacher. Laughter soothed the pain and sorrow of that terrible day. We were able to remember and laugh at the great times we had in class with him throughout our @ CAPS3. @ ORGANIZATION1 and @ ORGANIZATION1 years. We could remember the man @ PERSON2 was through the little tickle in our bellies. Laughter brought us together in a moment of need.

One thing people around the world love to do the most is laugh. Why do we like to laugh? Laughter is very important in our lives because it brings us joy, happiness, and above all it fills our stomachs with butterflies. An important thing about laughing is the whole point of view. Of course, everyone makes jokes, silly things, or just makes a funny comment. All of these things make you laugh, sometimes laughter helps people develop a good relationship and it gets strong. In relationships like boyfriend / girlfriend, parents with their kids, family or even friends have to laugh a little bit in their relationship because otherwise it would be a boring relationship. Sometimes it's hard to bring laughter into the picture, but we have to at least try to laugh, it's healthy for us to laugh every now and then. In families it is important to develop a relationship with the child or the parents and they need fun feelings in their stomachs that make them laugh inside and everything could laugh. Friends will always have fun times to laugh, sometimes it's the pranks they play, the funny comments, the jokes and it's also easy to start laughing and building a great relationship just by laughing with each other. others. Sometimes laughter can cause bad things if we use it for bad things and it can cause a bad relationship. We also don't want to hurt someone by making fun of them because of something that happened or if someone made a comment, as that might keep us from laughing too much after losing a relationship with them. someone. The smiles that people have on their faces are a wonderful thing to see. In all relationships, laughter is an important thing because it can always be supported. People have bad days sometimes and we always try to make them happy and how do we do that, well, it's called laughing. I know if I was having a bad day and felt down and flabby, I would like someone to make me laugh by just saying a hilarious joke. In my opinion, I like to laugh and especially to make people laugh around me. Sometimes I have my bad times and I need to laugh in my system to at least feel better. I know sadness can get the better of you sometimes, but we all need to think positively and not let negative things get the best of you. Life is so much better if we all have laughter in them. Imagine the world with just laughter, what life would be like. I would like that to happen because it would make everyone full of happiness and smiles on their faces. In my personal life, my family and friends are full of laughter. I have to make jokes at times when things get tough and everyone is freaking out. Laughter is part of us, whether we like it or not, it will always be with us no matter what. Finally, I would say that laughter is an element in my life that I will always wear and I hope everyone in the world has the element of laughter in them because seriously it is important in this world.

 Laughter, for me, is an important aspect of my relationship with anyone. I cherish laughter, and I use it every chance I get. For many, @ MONTH1 laughter is trivial, but for me it holds the key to my relationships with others. Seriously, many of the wonderful people I have met in my life might not be theirs because I have used laughter to develop them into friendships. Friends were hard to find in my childhood. I didn't make good choices, not who I partnered with; rather, with the way I approached other people for the first time. I would sound brash, rude, or boring, to name a few. I had no experience building relationships and first impressions are very important. Like any meal, the first sense that is called upon is sight. The image of the meal floods the mind, then the aroma wafts aimlessly towards you, and you begin to salivate in anticipation. And like any recipe, to perfect it, you have to practice, and that's what I did. It was a long and arduous process, but during my second year at @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 I started to feel like I had mastered the art of making others laugh. As students and individuals people come and go, we @ MONTH1 really end up forgetting their whole being, or we @ MONTH1 leave an impression on their minds. I try that with laughter; to remember if not, only for a day. By using laughter, I gained new opportunities to make friends, and I didn't waste those opportunities. I surrounded myself with a laugh, I developed the skills to make people laugh. I enjoyed it, and still do. One relationship that I have built is with a young woman. I had never spoken to him before, until our teacher brought us together as a group. Laughter was the cornerstone of our future relationship. I was myself, I would not pretend to be someone that I am not, I would express puns that our youth are so fond of, euphemisms that our generation knows well. We listened to the same music, and little by little our relationship turned into an unwavering friendship. It has grown to the point where, in the classroom, we yearn for each other's company. We are looking for lessons to have together because we like to make each other laugh. And because of the laughter, I made a friend with whom I share secrets, times and moments that I will cherish forever. Recently she decided to start playing tennis. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. I would not want anything more to help him, and anyone who decides to participate in my leadership. I don't necessarily claim to be the best, but I have confidence in my ability to teach the techniques, and the fundamentals of the game. There isn't much more I would like to do, that is -to say practicing the sport that I love, with the women that I love. And most of the credit goes to the laughter because when her kind face lights up because of something I've said, it means everyone to me whether she knows it or not. I have a lot of such connections with other people of both sexes, but none more so than his. I worked hard to bond with other people because they would make life easier and all the more enjoyable. In @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 there are no exclusive social groups, nor itinerant gangs of football players ready to select the weakest of the student population. We are all friends, we are all a community, we all belong, and this is due, in part, to laughter. Laughter connects people all over the world, it is the universal language that all races, skin colors and religions speak. It can bring us together or separate us, but the most prescribed medicine in life is laughter.

 People always say that the worst times in life are the sad times, the times when no one is there to make you laugh or smile. These sad moments prevail over problems caused by work or society and show how important laughter is in our lives. A time when someone feels a joy so strong that it spills out in the form of a chuckle or a thunderous laugh, these are the times when life is worth living, worth the work, bad ruptures and overpriced society. It has been said by those infamous "they" that your worst most tragic moments are the ones that are remembered forever because they contain the most emotion, but I disagree with "them". The moments of life, whether they are seconds, hours, weeks or years, can be cherished too if they are built by the bonds of love and laughter. Just recently it was my birthday. This year it fell on a @ DATE1 and I had no plans to celebrate in any way. Of course, my parents had given me plenty of gifts, but the joy and nervous excitement I had always felt before my birthday was not in me. Those feelings were probably due to the fact that this year I had decided that now that I was in high school, birthday parties were banned. With no plans or exciting activities to look forward to, my birthday was not looked forward to as it had been every year before. What would I do?! Definitely didn't want to spend the day at home in my pajamas with my parents and two sisters, that's what I did almost everyone else @ DATE1. These thoughts and realizations brought to me that sad sense of loneliness, those feelings that are the worst parts of life. My mother, noticing the sadness of my birthday, suggested a trip to the beach and an overnight stay in a yurt. I love the beach, I would even go so far as to say it is my favorite place in the world. I also like yurts. Yurts are large, round cabins made of canvas draped around a wooden structure, with a skylight directly atop the pointed roof where the stars could be seen at night. Staying in a yurt at the beach seemed better to me than being at home, so naturally I accepted the trip to the beach. Deep inside I was excited, I was thrilled, a trip to the beach with my family! In my head, I was still stuck in my hazy state of sadness as thoughts swirled through my head that I wouldn't be having a good time if there weren't any friends to laugh with and hang out with. , and how much I was a loser for not doing anything with friends but my family instead. Our household consists of my mom, dad and two sisters who are four years old and @ NUM1 months old. We are not the most successful family. I find my older sister an annoying kid sent by the devil to ruin my life and do all my fault. Two out of three girls always have to be in some sort of fight, and that drives my mom crazy which makes her all pissed off and my dad angry until we realize the light year buzz has ruffled everyone. our feathers. This scene is exactly what I imagined from my trip to the beach for my family's birthday, but caused by a long drive and hungry kids rather than the light year buzz. The day was approaching and we were up early to pack our bags and pack the car. My mother, bless her, told us as a family that today was my day and all I wanted was what I had. This meant that I had to choose what we were going to eat, what we would do, and that I could make any comments, including telling my little sisters to get angry if I wanted to. At lunch we had visited the beach, settled into our yurt and enjoyed a lunch of various snacks we brought and found myself to be enjoying myself. No one had fought all day, raised their voice, made a sarcastic comment, or done anything to disrupt the happy atmosphere we were in. I was laughing. As we visited the aquarium with all of its weird fish, I laughed. I made fun of my sisters when they did something stupid. I laughed at the things my mother said to me. We all laughed at a cyclist bumping into a pole and a fish vacuuming its lips. All the laughs, all the smiles brought me a lot. It pushed those negative thoughts out of my mind and told them never to come back. Laughing helped me see all the love that surrounded my family, it made the love visible. It's healthy to laugh. Without laughing in our lives, some things like love, which can sometimes be invisible, become visible again through laughter.

 Why can people look back and laugh, but not while the action is unfolding? For example, if you see someone being hit by a car. During this event, no one would laugh. There would most likely be people rushing frantically for help and ambulances everywhere. But we see people getting hit by cars all the time on @ CAPS1 and it is considered funny. During a hot @ DATE1 @ TIME1, something quite similar happened to me and my friends. I live next to @ LOCATION1. I know this place on @ LOCATION1, it's called @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1. It has a rather strange name due to the fact that the water is actually greenish in color due to the reflection of the tree around it. The @ LOCATION1 is about thirty meters wide, nobody knows how deep it is because it is impossible to touch the bottom. The main attraction is a cliff, which ranges from @ NUM1 feet to NUM2 feet. On the other side of @ LOCATION1, there is a beautiful golden beach with huge trees behind it. The hike to @ ORGANIZATION1 is about a mile steep drop, which leads to the edge of the cliff. The @ LOCATION1 bed and throat are aligned in the same way that they are shaded most of the day, except in the morning. That day, I was going to bring @ CAPS2, @ PERSON2, @ CAPS3 and @ PERSON1. My friend @ CAPS2 is a daredevil. Although he is not very good at sports, he is ready to try just about anything. He was also homeschooled until his first year of high school, so he's also quite socially awkward and certainly not used to resisting negative pressure from his peers. On the other hand, I'm the kid doing crazy things, but I can pull them off. I was making gains at the edge of the cliff which was only about @ NUM1 feet from the water. Somehow @ CAPS2 ended up having to try one as well. As he mentally prepared for this stunt, we all gave him a countdown. @ NUM4, @ NUM5, @ NUM6, @ CAPS6 ! We all screamed at the same time. He ran to the edge of the cliff, as I showed him, he jumped, then brought his knee back to his chest. Nothing happened! That was the problem, @ CAPS2 hid but it never turned out. He fell like a rock. His back pointed straight at the water. There was what appeared to be a @ NUM7 second pause between when he jumped off the cliff and when he hit the water. His upper back was the first thing to come in contact with the water, there was a giant splash and the sound of a clap almost as loud as a small firecracker. @ NUM5 seconds later @ CAPS2 came out of the water he was trying to breathe but no air was entering his lungs. @ PERSON2, @ CAPS3, @ PERSON1 and I were all on the beach shore across the lake ! At the same time, we looked at each other, no one was laughing, everyone looked worried. Suddenly we booked it in the water. It was a swim of @ NUM9 meters to get to @ CAPS2. I was the first there. He was panting at the time, but he was still in a state of intense panic. I stayed away from him until @ PERSON1 arrived. @ PERSON1 is almost 6 '@ NUM7 and @ NUM11 pounds, so he first grabbed @ CAPS2 around the torso. I grabbed his legs, when @ CAPS3 and @ PERSON2 finally got there they grabbed his arms. We all pulled him down to the beach where he was able to put his feet safely on dry land. Who knows what would have happened if the panicked @ CAPS2 had arrived at the beach on his own. Although this is somehow @ CAPS18's fault for pressuring him in the first place. After almost @ NUM5 hours of basking in the sun and calming down the sun started to set behind the gorge, shadows were approaching us from the shore. It was only @ NUM5 @ LOCATION2. We decided to explore @ LOCATION1 a bit, also to find some more sun. We all got up and noticed that the entire back of @ CAPS2 was purple ! Not only because of his red skin, but the impact on the water created quite a bruise. Everyone except @ CAPS2 saw it and laughed at the memory of what had just happened before. @ CAPS2 looked behind him and saw his discolored back and was able to '@ CAPS3 hold back the laughter. Laughter came from everyone. This was the first time that @ CAPS2, @ CAPS3, @ PERSON2, @ PERSON1 and I have dated. Laughter was what brought us together. Now we are sharing @ CAPS18 @ LOCATION1 spot with all the other friends at @ CAPS18, but nothing beats me like that day. To this day we all remember that hot day @ DATE1 at @ ORGANIZATION1 when @ CAPS2 attempted a cliff top gainer. "Laughter is the shortest distance between two (or five) people."

 Before my best friend moved out, we would lie awake at night laughing for no reason. I don't know what would start us up, but it wouldn't stop until our laughter hurt so much in our stomachs that we fell asleep. Those nights her mom would come over to @ TIME1 and kindly ask us to calm down, which made us laugh even more. When we're together it's pretty dangerous to be there. We have become so close that we are practically sisters in a way. Laughter is important in all of my relationships. I grew up in a large family where laughter is key, and positive attitudes were expected. During @ DATE1, @ CAPS1 and I are working together, so we have plenty of time to reflect on the same path. If we're on a short drive and want to get somewhere, we realize it. We are very good at handling our elders, a skill acquired during years of practice on @ CAPS2. It only takes one glance to see what the other is plotting, then a laugh will follow, letting the manipulated know that it's doomed, or will be very soon. Our ploys are generally harmless, maybe just a little bit of a tickle aside from being tickled too hard. It doesn't help that we're both small and strong and full of energy, just waiting for the right person to show up. @ CAPS1 and I find ways to create trouble all around us, whether it's jumping from behind corners or taking the keys from the manager. When I go somewhere, I usually aim for positive places with an upbeat vibe and people who make me happy. I don't like and avoid places I don't like, I'm the type to joke or be sarcastic when things are too calm or too serious. Serious environments intimidate me, @ CAPS6 is out of my comfort zone. Laughter brings people together and lightens people's moods. No one likes embarrassing situations where no one is saying anything, so I usually break the silence with a blonde joke or something. I was coming back to @ ORGANIZATION2 from @ LOCATION3, @ CAPS3 and met some great people along the way. When I got on the plane, I looked for a place to sit and then I chose the seat between an elderly woman and a man who looked like my father (I was alone on the flight). I thought, for the next hour, I'll be with these people, so I better do something that I can remember. The man had helped me put my carry-on in the overhead storage which was very kind of him. The old woman and I started talking, and the topic of horses was brought up, and when horses are in conversion @ CAPS6 is usually associated with a lot of fall stories. She talked about this @ CAPS4 horse called @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5, how he had his own mind and how he would do things his own way. The problem with horses is this : @ CAPS6 knows @ CAPS6 is a bit bigger than us, and can really do like @ CAPS6 please, but most choose to listen like @ CAPS6 don't like be corrected. I recounted my first hikes and how I didn't know much except how to steer the massive animal beneath me. Before we knew it, we were landing at @ LOCATION1 and my new friends got off the plane. When my plane landed at @ LOCATION1 I figured I would fly to @ ORGANIZATION2 sitting alone. After a few minutes, a teenage girl came up and sat down next to me. The first thing she did was give me some chewing gum, which I accepted. The first part of the ride was quiet, but after a while the crying baby got boring to listen to, so we started talking. She was flying to @ LOCATION2 to her father's house. We talked about our families and our hobbies, and we had a great time. After flying in @ Organization1, I am welcomed me home, I was back in the eternal rain of state and I could see nothing but clouds from my window. Laughter is all around us, and there is always something to laugh about, look at the bright side of life. People are more drawn to those who can make them laugh, so have a sense of humor and you'll be in great company. Laughs and smiles make the world go round, so keep laughing.

                              @ ORGANIZATION1 @ DATE1 for my birthday @ CAPS1, we went to @ ORGANIZATION1 for a week, @ CAPS16 was so much fun when we got there but the ride wasn't fun at all. When we got to the house that @ TIME1 is was so beautiful the snow was falling and @ CAPS16 was falling so hard @ CAPS16 looked like white cotton balls and the snow on the house was incredibly wonderful, I mean @ CAPS16 seriously looked like to @ CAPS16 could have belonged to a storybook as a princess castle. When we entered the house @ CAPS16 was really relaxed and no one really wanted to do anything, almost all of us fell asleep on the couch. The next morning when we woke up we were all having breakfast and looking at the snow on DATE2 there was a knock on the door so of course I had to @ CAPS9 to get @ @ CAPS16 because my CAPS17 was "too tired" so I got I got up and went to open the door and three huge boys came and picked me up. At first I was like "@ CAPS2 who are these boys ?" but after they took off their caps i noticed that @ CAPS16 was my cousin @ PERSON1, his best friend @ PERSON2 and his other friend @ CAPS3. So they brought me back to the table and made me sit down and @ CAPS16 was funny because all of my @ CAPS17 was laughing so hard they couldn't breathe and I still had a horrified look on my face. They shouted "@ CAPS4" then got out and started building snow ramps for snowboarding. So I got dressed and went out with them and at first they were like "@ CAPS5 great, there she is". And they usually give me a lot of attention, but they weren't, so I decided I needed more attention, so when they weren't looking, I went to sit and crawl. snowboard they had built and of course @ PERSON2 knew why I was doing it @ CAPS16 but @ CAPS3 and @ PERSON1 still had no idea so of course they told me to get off but I told them "@ CAPS7 "and that pissed them off so @ PERSON1 said" @ CAPS8 girl if you don't move i will jump over you ", sure i was super crazy at this point and wanted to see if he would actually do @ CAPS16 so I told him "@ CAPS9 coming soon" @ PERSON1 started at @ CAPS9 but then @ PERSON2 grabbed him, @ CAPS10 him snowboarding and started yelling at him @ CAPS11 by the time the whole argument was over , the witch @ CAPS11 the path lasted most of the day. I went to my bedroom and TIME1 @ @ @ PERSON1 NUM1 @ CAPS3 and went to the bar and the next morning I was told to sleep but I woke up at seven CAPS11 @ @ @ CAPS3 PERSON2 and shouting to @ PERSON1 for get up but they didn't lift it they lifted me up i was so angry i felt like a mama bear just woke up in the middle of hibernation. @ CAPS16 was so irritating to be a house with three hangovers twenty one @ DATE1 old but I had fun anyway, that @ TIME1 they weren't home @ CAPS14 god but with them no there was peace and quiet so we played @ CAPS15 and @ LOCATION3, @ CAPS16 was so much fun we had a blast. The next morning it wasn't much fun as we had another @ CAPS17, @ CAPS18 us. I swear I was so pissed off I wanted to pounce on them like an angry tiger about to grab its prey. So I tried to stay away as much as possible which was a bit difficult because they all love me but I just decided to lock myself in my room for the day to avoid them, @ CAPS16 kinda sucks but @ CAPS16 was a lot better than making them scream in my ear every five seconds. The day after we cleaned up and started getting ready to leave @ CAPS16 wasn't fun at all but my @ CAPS17 made sure I was cleaning up and we ate three meals and after each meal we cleaned up again but that @ TIME1 we went to bed and you I didn't hear from anyone because we were so tired but the next morning we left at seven and started going back to @ LOCATION2 @ CAPS16 was so much fun to be at @ LOCATION1 we made @ CAPS16 a tradition but we weren't able to @ CAPS9 this @ DATE1 because of the formal winter, but we are definitely going back this @ DATE1 and we will have twice the fun. is two years old !

 Gloomy and drowsy, I woke up. I woke up to go to @ LOCATION1. I was going to @ LOCATION1 to watch a few basketball games, I was. Although I couldn't participate in the activity because I was @ CAPS1 injured in the previous week of training. Unfortunately, I still had to go and support my friends and teammates. It was around @ NUM1 hours when we all got on the bus and left for @ LOCATION1. All my friends were cheerful and talkative; but me on the other hand, I was in a nonchalant glance. The bus ride seemed to last a lifetime; but in two hours we reached our destination. @ LOCATION1 had a nice school ; but we were all going to find out that it sometimes looked like a ghost town. The high school seemed lifeless in comparison to other schools where we had played in the past. There was no one around and not a soul to be heard. We were all sitting there patiently waiting; then, after maybe five minutes or so, a man introduced himself and led us to the locker room. The boys had to wait for the girls to finish playing their game; so we all went and started shooting one of the auxiliary courts. However, unfortunately due to my injury I was unable to participate in the activity. They were all having so much fun fucking there. The mere thought of not being there with them made me sick. After the girls' game, we all went to change. After that we all just sat there joking and waiting for our coach to come and give us our pre-game pep talk. It seemed like centuries before our coach finally walked into the locker room. He spoke about what we should and should not do to achieve victory. When the game started I was really depressed, but I sucked it in and cheered on my team. The first half of the game was excellent and we were on top. Even though the second half was not that good. We only scored six points and ended up losing the game by a wide margin. My friends have tried to be stoic; but I could tell they were ashamed. Ashamed of their performance in the second half. It made me sad and depressed once again. Then I had no choice but to go watch two more games in the old crude and uncomfortable stands at @ LOCATION1. The first of two games was excellent; we won by two points. The next game, on the other hand, was very boring. It seemed to take forever; but the worst part is that we lost. After this last match, I had to wait for my cousin to come out of the locker room. When he did, we went to check with our coaches; we had to leave to go home with our parents. So we left; but first we had to find something to eat. Once again, like every time before, we chose to eat at @ ORGANIZATION1. We walked across the aisle, grabbed our food, then stopped so we could eat. At first everything seemed okay; but my cousin noticed that he had not received the @ CAPS2 he ordered. So we went there to fix the problem. Afterwards, we all joked that the restaurant wasn't getting the right order; then I took a bite of my burger. It was then that I realized that I had received a burger without a patty. I was really upset that @ ORGANIZATION1 made such a stupid mistake. So once again my cousin and I went to the restaurant. When told what the problem was, they were all in shock. They couldn't believe what they had done. So after they all settled down they made me another burger. Me and the family were all having fun at the @ ORGANIZATION1 events. It was a great trip home filled with fun and laughter; which was not what I expected, my cousin or anyone else. So, at the end of my once dark day, I found myself laughing.

 Some time ago my mom decided to send me to camp @ DATE3. When I heard this I was pretty upset, @ CAPS1 I wouldn't know anyone there. Before the start of the camp, I did everything I could so that my mother would not let go of me. After a while, I knew I wouldn't make it, and before I knew it, I had gone camping. When I arrived at the place that took us to the camp, there were not many people. When I arrived at the camp, I was wrong, there were a lot of people I didn't know. It was extremely scary, but it was too late to go home now. Walking to my cabin was nerve-racking, @ CAPS1 I had no idea who would be in my cabin. Meeting the girls in my cabin was awkward mainly @ CAPS1 we didn't know each other and secondly our advisor was so weird. Right after meeting each other, our advisor made us all play a game of @ CAPS2. At first playing @ CAPS2 with strangers was weird, but after a while we started to laugh. We played and laughed for hours and hours, until lunchtime. Lunch with the girls wasn't that scary as we had so much fun playing @ CAPS2, but we still didn't really know each other. At the end of lunch the first thing we did was play @ CAPS2, the more we laughed and had fun the more we got to know each other. All @ DATE1, we played the silly little game of @ CAPS2, and we just laughed and laughed. @ DATE2 arrived on the second @ DATE1 of the camp and we had all almost become friends laughing and playing @ CAPS2. We played it so much the first @ DATE1 that we just called it "@ CAPS6 @ CAPS2" instead of @ CAPS2. Like other things, we got tired of @ CAPS2 and parted ways for some free time. Everyone agreed that the free time @ DATE1 was so boring, so we replayed @ CAPS2. Laugh and laugh until our stomachs hurt from laughing so hard I think it was @ DATE1, we all really became friends. We had become thieves in a few days, we did everything together. We talked, we swam, we played tennis and, most of all, we laughed together. The camp was not what I expected, it was much better. All the girls in my cabin had become friends so quickly that it was strange to the others, not really, but it was rather strange to become best friends in just a few days. The camp was flying for us and before we all knew it it was almost @ DATE1. Things were going so well, until one of us got sick. I was the one who got sick it was horrible I stayed in bed all @ DATE1 missing everything that was happening. Worse yet, I had almost lost my voice, lying on the bed without laughing with my friends and having fun was just torture. @ DATE4 The @ DATE1 of the camp was fast approaching, and all I could do was stay in bed. @ DATE4 was there, but it was a relief when I got to speak again. The rest of @ DATE1 @ DATE1 of camp, I could be out of bed enjoying camp. When @ DATE1 the hour ended and evening came, we had our party in the cabin. Our party was so much fun, even though we had to stay inside our cabin. We ate all of our goodies that we kept from the concession stand and all the goodies brought in by our advisor. It was almost @ TIME1 so we had to go to bed soon, @ CAPS1 we went to @ TIME2. There was one @ DATE1 thing we needed to do, and it was a @ DATE1 game from @ CAPS2. We played for about an hour, @ CAPS1 had to come over and tell us to shut up. Thinking back to my first year at camp, I still remember how we all became friends. We still talk about it every year at camp, and we still play @ CAPS2. That year at camp I think is one of my favorite memories, @ CAPS1, we all became friends just by playing @ CAPS2 and laughing together.

 Everyone knows how important a laugh can be. Everyone has a different laugh, it can be powerful and touching or devastating and hurtful. Someone once said, “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people. I agree with this statement everyone has a different laugh and laughs for many different reasons, laughter is so powerful someone can make you laugh when you are upset or unhappy and they could change everything and how you are feeling. Laughter is a way to connect with others, you laugh when you're having fun, getting hurt, and needing someone. Laughs are surprising, you never know when you are going to laugh and why, it could be from a little joke or from a complicated and funny story being told to you. During @ DATE1, I was going back to @ PERSON1 from @ LOCATION1, and I was very nervous and scared to be the new kid again. Even though I had known some people since living here, nothing was going to change the fact that I was the new kid. Shortly after moving, I reconnected with old friends that I have known from second year when I previously lived here. My friends and I always have a good time, laugh and just go crazy. All of us girls have been through a lot the last few years and this @ DATE1, and it was nice to see them and talk to them again after everything that happened to us, we all left and made our own stuff and became friends with different people, but we're still close friends after all this time. It was good spending time with them and seeing how much they have changed. We have all changed a lot in recent years. And we @ MONTH1 got into a fight which caused some drama and some of us moved out but we've been through almost everything since we were little and we'll probably be friends throughout high school and bonding. @ DATE1 was almost over and school was about to start again. Three other friends and I wanted to do something together one last time before school started. So we planned to have a big slumber party. one of the friends lives at @ LOCATION2, and she was able to go out to @ PERSON1 and spend that slumber party with us. It was like second year again, I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life. Soon after we arrived we laughed, talked and had a great time. That night we were all sleeping, we were thinking of something fun to do, and my friends decided it would be fun to go @ CAPS1'ing, so we asked her mom if it was @ CAPS2 and she said as long as we don't go too far from your house and we have our phones with us in case we need to call her and she will come and get us. It was still a bit too early for @ CAPS1'ing, so until we waited for it to get dark we walked to the store down the street from his house and bought some bags and bags. toilet paper bags. It still wasn't dark or late enough to go so we watched movies, went to the mall and put our feet in its hot tub. It was nice to be back and to be with all my old friends again. We stayed up and eventually it was dark and late so we put on all the black clothes we owned and got dressed up so no one could recognize us, we looked pretty convincing. We put on big jackets so we could hide the toilet paper in our jackets and if anyone saw us walking they wouldn't see any toilet paper. We tried to stop and sneak around houses, but it didn't work, we were so loud we couldn't stop talking or laughing. We were so loud that we also couldn't hear other kids going out late on their bikes. They got closer and closer and we realized it was other friends we knew from school, they got on board and went for a bike ride. They helped us @ CAPS1 in some houses and it was getting very late so we decided to go home. This @ DATE1 was one I will never forget, we had so much fun and agreed that we had never laughed so much about anything. It has been a difficult year for all of us and it was great to see familiar faces and hang out with real friends like we used to.

 Laughter is an important part of my family. We laugh together, we breathe together and we die together. When it comes to a family, the most important thing that brings @ CAPS1 together besides having fun, loving each other and spending quality time together is what makes @ CAPS1 laugh and what keeps @ CAPS1 together @ CAPS1 close. For me, my siblings and my parents, we should always have fun and laugh, whether one is upset or the other is angry. No matter the situation, @ CAPS3 is always a time when we have the best times, even @ CAPS2 points when one of us doesn't want to see each other. I was having an adventurous day with one of my close friends, @ LOCATION1 and we decided it was time to come home and get ready so I could spend the night @ CAPS2 his house. When @ LOCATION1 and I walked into my house, @ CAPS3 was so restless and screaming that we decided that maybe we should sit down and figure out what was going on. As we were sitting down we started laughing out loud @ CAPS2 at the sight of my step dad, @ PERSON1 shouting @ CAPS2 my older sister, @ ORGANIZATION1. We didn't know what had just happened, but we really wanted to find out. "I can't believe @ CAPS1 just can't go next door to @ PERSON2's house and ask for toilet paper as I sit anxiously on the toilet with the hope that @ CAPS1 will bring me toilet paper for an hour. Yet they came to our house and asked for our plunger, which is much more embarrassing, "@ PERSON1 said. As soon as these words came violently out of her mouth, we started to laugh out loud. I felt like my stomach was constricting so much that I couldn't breathe. With as much attitude as @ CAPS1 can put into your tone of voice, @ ORGANIZATION1 had said, "@ CAPS1 doesn't need toilet paper to clean up! @ CAPS1 could have easily jumped in the shower and used the head shower to wash off shit ! " @ CAPS2 this point @ CAPS3 did not correspond to @ CAPS2 what she said. My stepfather was furious that she said such a thing. Without any hesitation, @ CAPS6 quickly picked up the phone and dialed my mom's number. Wait, and wait for her to pick up. Suddenly @ LOCATION1 and I heard a voice on the phone. @ PERSON1 started screaming as he told my mom about the situation. It got to a point where @ CAPS6 said words that @ CAPS6 shouldn't have said. As the words rolled across her tongue, @ CAPS6 started to stutter. @ CAPS6 spoke: "@ CAPS3 was not toilet paper and @ ORGANIZATION1 was not going to get me some from @ PERSON2's house. Unfortunately I had to get up, wet my hands and wash my hands after wiping my buttocks with my own hand. " @ CAPS3 didn't stop us from laughing as hard as we could. I had never heard of something so disgusting that made me want to throw up all over our leather sofas. @ CAPS6 was so anxious to pick up my sister's phone that @ CAPS6 immediately asked before telling my mom. @ CAPS6 didn't care even though my mom told her @ CAPS6 couldn't remove it. @ CAPS6 wanted to have it so @ CAPS6 knew how my sister would feel. Not only did @ CAPS6 take his phone, @ CAPS6 took away his right to use toilet paper after using the bathroom. I don't know how long I laughed about it, but I felt like I was going to pee on myself. As @ LOCATION1 and I continued to laugh, @ CAPS6 walked up the stairs as fast as @ CAPS6 could by rummaging through every bathroom in our house for every little square of @ CAPS3 toilet paper. The sad part was @ CAPS6 even took the shower head off so my sister couldn't use it to clean herself as well. My mom came home and @ CAPS3 had nothing to say. @ CAPS6 was so embarrassed that we had heard that @ CAPS6 had wiped his buttocks with his hand. Not only that, but I had put the story as my status on @ CAPS5 and @ CAPS6 had seen it. I didn't mention any names other than @ LOCATION1 and me, but the fact that @ CAPS6 knew the story was about him made his cheeks as red as a cherry. @ PERSON1 started to wonder. My sister had said that @ CAPS3 was not toilet paper and when @ CAPS6 asked if @ CAPS3 was towels she also said "no". @ CAPS6 started looking in the cupboards and quickly found some towels. @ CAPS6 was so angry, but @ CAPS2 at the same time was laughing very loudly. @ CAPS6 felt that @ CAPS6 should be looking on the bright side. A week has passed and my step dad @ PERSON1 still hasn't put a roll of toilet paper in the bathroom. @ CAPS6 said: "@ CAPS1 @ MONTH1 thinks it's funny when this happens to me, but it will be when @ CAPS1 doesn't have toilet paper."

 Laughter is an important part of any kind of relationship like your family, friends or your other half. Now let me tell you why this is important, there were two weeks left in school and my family had planned to go camping for a week. Finally school was over and we were all saying goodbye and see you next year to all our friends. My parents picked us up in what my dad called an "@ CAPS1" that looked like a regular school bus. We were now on our way to our campsite. Now you would think that going camping would be for reuniting the family and having fun. But no, my brothers were locked into their video games, my mom and sister were both on the phone while my dad was driving. I even asked them why they brought electronics and all I got for a response was a "because". Eventually I just decided to give it up and read on until we got to our campsite. Finally we got there and the first thing we did was unload the @ CAPS1 and set everything up so we could get comfortable. That same night we were all by the campfire, and as usual my family was having fun playing video games, cell phones, or whatever they thought was necessary here in the wilderness. As I sat by the fire, I looked at the stars above my head and started to wonder if my family would always be like this and never be close, fun or even exciting. The next morning after we all woke up my parents were making breakfast and my mom asked me if I remembered to close the door @ CAPS1 before going to sleep in my tent, and I said no, i forgot to know how my mom was doing. a little crazy and asked my sister to go shut it up. As she walked towards the door she heard noises and walked in to see what it was. Before I could even blink, I saw her sprint out of @ CAPS1 and scream at the top of her lungs. Right behind her was a group or raccoons chasing her! My dad trying to be a hero runs towards them trying to scare them, but fails and gets his butt bitten. Luckily my dad was @ CAPS5 but while we were all distracted the raccoons were gone with our food. My dad was so angry that he threw the only log that was preventing the @ CAPS1 from rolling. And it starts to move right away, we all watch it come down the hill until it flows into a lake. Slowly it started to disappear once it was completely out of sight we all went to the lake looking at the big lake that devoured @ CAPS1 wondering what we were going to do without a vehicle. As we made our way back to the campsite all you could hear for miles was my family arguing. not paying attention to what was in front of them my mom fell into a mud pit and my dad tried to get her out but slipped inside too. Once outside they looked so indignant and seemed ready to call on Mother Nature to fight. When we got back to the campsite, we sat down and I took a good look at each of us. Our clothes were all wet and covered in mud, we were all hungry and not really in a good mood. I sat there and said dad wasn't getting any more angry, but I thought it was pretty funny when the raccoon bit your butt, and I showed him the pic that I took when it happened. My family then all looked at him and started laughing and laughing, we suddenly started talking and acting like family ! We decided to walk home and hitchhike, we walked the road for a good hour until we were driven by a local trucker that we saw on the road. When we got home we talked more, we spent more time together, we really were like the perfect family that I wished we had. This camping trip has changed us all and I'm happy because now my family and I are closer than ever! And this is how I can prove that laughter is an important part of any relationship.

Some time ago, on a hot day @ DATE1, my @ NUM1, @ PERSON3, @ PERSON1, @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON2. I wanted to do something that could relieve us from the extreme heat. So we sat down and chatted about what we could do and where we wanted to go. So @ PERSON7 had some ideas, one was to go to the house @ LOCATION3 where there was air conditioning, his other idea was to walk @ NUM2 miles to the swimming hole @ CAPS1, but the only reason why he wanted to go was because his girlfriend would be there i really know you hate @ CAPS1 but nobody wanted to walk that far in the heat then come back to @ CAPS3 @ NUM3 had three ideas number one of his ideas was to walk to his uncle's house at NUM4 miles to see if we could take a ride to @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5, his second idea was to go down to our friends @ PERSON5 and go for a swim in his built-in pool, his third idea was to go to the back yard I spray us with the hose. @ PERSON1 had two ideas, one was to see if he could ask his mother to lend him money to fill his tank and pay her back, his other idea was to drive to the coast and there camp for a few days if he got the money from his mother. Byran had three ghetto ideas, one was to go jump in the water fountain near @ ORGANIZATION1 then quickly get out before we had any trouble, the second idea was to go to @ LOCATION4 ... AKA the @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 and jump over the fence, then he was going to let us in, his third idea was to go to the retirement homes and swim in the pool because he said he knew a @ NUM5 had three ideas, one was to walk a mile to the forks, the second was to walk down to the creek at NUM4 miles. I was with @ PERSON1 on his ideas to go to the coast and to camp and what not because I like to camp at the beach it smells good most of the time there are very beautiful girls so yes I was far away to go to the coast for real. So we sat down and waited and waited and waited for @ PERSON1's mom to finally call us, her phone would ring, we were all excited, but it was just her grandma calling her, we were disgusted. so there we were waiting once again for what seems like forever a phone call from @ ORGANIZATION3 @ NUM7 to ring we had no hope this time we thought it was someone else but guess what this time it was actually @ PERSON1's mom, she said she would lend her the money, but we boys had to do something for her, she wanted us to go down to the bimor and choose @ CAPS9 at work then bought him cigars for @ PERSON1's grandfather so we did, after we finished the run we packed our clothes, blankets, sleeping bag, food, camping supplies and our wood. After a good hour it was @ NUM4 @ CAPS10.M. we went to the chevron and refueled the reservoir @ PERSON1 then drove to @ ORGANIZATION2 city @ LOCATION1 the almost two hour drive it seemed but what a great ride long tunnels beautiful river, mountains oh and who could forget the beautiful big red woods of @ LOCATION1 and the smell of this forest you can smell it through almost any car. Thought it was funny when we got closer to the coast the temperature dropped @ NUM9 degrees @ CAPS11 and everyone was in a good mood and could smell the coastal air. When we got to the campsite we ran to the beach as people looked at us like we were crazy or something because we swam like @ NUM10 feet in @ NUM9 degrees of water it was funny because people didn't stop talking but we found out we were swimming in a red zone where there had been rising tide warnings so after that we were really @ LOCATION2 and we realized we weren't had no propane so we had to go into town and buy propane for our stove so we did and then ate the best hotdogs ever dipped in @ ORGANIZATION4 honey it was delicious we stayed on the coast one night then @ PERSON6 was called to go to work so we had to leave and go back to the heat in @ CAPS12 @ CAPS6 @ CAPS13 it was one way a big drag and it was so hot coming home we were quite upset with you mps but when we got back @ CAPS3 mum wanted to go to the river so in the end everything was fine.

 In most stories mothers and daughters are either enemies or friends, but in @ CAPS13's story we are both enemies and friends ; at one point we were like that. Much more @ CAPS4. I'm sixteen now and she's forty and were just friends i mean she is still @ CAPS13 mom and she can still punish me as her daughter however she wants but we are working on this and we laugh about it. About seven months ago @ CAPS13 mom moved from @ LOCATION4 to @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION2 I chose to stay to finish high school with @ CAPS13 my current friends. When she moved, the way we acted with each other would be different, and it is, we act completely differently with each other, now we treasure the little time we have and I will explain to you How? 'Or' What. At first, for as long as I can remember @ CAPS13's mom and I always argued over the dumbest things, we never got along. And here is what I think the reason is. I'm her daughter, I was born like her, her face, her hair, her eyes, everything, even the @ CAPS13 attitude and the sound of @ CAPS13's laughter. She's stubborn I'm stubborn and we both like to argue, not really with other people just with the two of us but if we were to do business together things would get done, let's say if we became lawyers we would work great together because i inherited his work ethic and we both like to discuss valid points. But as I got a little bigger and we went through some traumatic times together, we started to see the bright side in life, and that just being together is enough to keep us from falling apart. . The events of our lives that we have been through brought us together @ CAPS1, it was all over and done. What I mean by that is we stopped arguing, we comforted each other when we needed comfort, we became friends, and I think laughter is a big part of that. @ CAPS13 mom, her name by the way is @ LOCATION5, once said "Laughter brings two people together, the only thing human beings all know how to do is laugh and it is something we can all share." @ CAPS1 our life had calmed down and we could live normally, like with a house and lights and a dog with a garden, things were going well between us, we still quarreled often but never like before. Which would be throwing things at each other across the room, like I said, things are better now. One night we found out that laughter is something we both use to block things out that we no longer want to haunt us. I love to sing, @ CAPS13 and @ CAPS11's mom made me grow up around music like ; The @ CAPS2, @ LOCATION3, @ PERSON2, @ PERSON4, and many others but we were singing a song together something only the two of us shared and it was "@ CAPS3're @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5" by @ PERSON3. But we were singing that specific song in the car, singing it in front of our family and @ CAPS1 the moment was over we were laughing about it because for once it was something only @ CAPS13 mom and I were sharing and it was special. Laughter has played a big part in who we are as people today. There are always things people do together, @ CAPS13 mom grew up in a strict house @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7, she also had four sisters and @ CAPS8 was very serious business. @ CAPS13 mom and I went to @ CAPS8 together and we always tried not to take life @ CAPS4 seriously all the time, @ CAPS4 while in @ CAPS8 we started @ CAPS15 about some kind of nasty bug on the wall, or she would laugh at me because I would drop the prayer book on the foot @ CAPS13, but we were still laughing. "@ CAPS10 or I'll bring @ CAPS11 @ CAPS12 here and @ CAPS3 will have to take a religion class extra. "@ CAPS13 mom would say as I was pushing her or making fun of her and I would say" @ CAPS14 won't make me take an extra class, I'll tell her @ CAPS3 started it. " C ' is who @ CAPS13 mom and I were and always were like this. Even though she moved to @ LOCATION2 for a new job, and @ CAPS4, she got to see the man she loves more often than every six months we are still talking, and like I said we are laughing when we cry and, man, we cry a lot, especially on the phone when I tell her I miss her. This is the story of @ CAPS13's mom and the laughter we've shared over the past sixteen years, and to quote @ PERSON1 "@ CAPS15 is the best calorie burner." I believe this and @ CAPS13 mom and I see it like that, @ CAPS15 is the only thing we can do when we are not feeling hot @ CAPS4 or not feeling ourselves, @ CAPS4 yes she is right when she Said that laugh brings two people closer together, and it's absolutely true, we have a better relationship than ever.

 I never understood that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, say I dated @ PERSON2. We have started to release the @ NUM1 class. @ CAPS6 indeed you @ MONTH1 think it was puppy love, @ CAPS4 I still think to this day it was real real love. We lived about an hour and a half apart and only saw each other two or three times a month, @ CAPS4 it was always the best time of my life, with all the good and fun times we have past. We met through my ex boyfriend and his best friend @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1. @ PERSON1 went to school with me and @ PERSON1's mom and nickname's mom were best friends so they grew up together and were best friends too. To sum up how we met, I was dating @ PERSON1 and I had to go to the movies with him and his friend, @ CAPS4 @ PERSON1 didn't show up so I was stuck with @ PERSON2 and we hit it off right after that . The more time we spent together, the more we laughed, had fun and on top of that, we made memories that last a lifetime. If we couldn't see each other, we would talk on the phone for hours. (and when I say hours, I mean, @ NUM2 hours.) Or we were texting all the time. we would make funny jokes, talk about bullshit about people we hate, talk about family bullshit and finally @ CAPS4 laughed at each other. we would have so many good times talking and laughing all our time. After about @ NUM2 months of dating, things turned out badly. "I can't do this long distance thing anymore," @ PERSON2 said. "@ CAPS2? @ CAPS2 can't we just sort things out?" I said with tears starting to flow. "" @ CAPS3, it's just not far for us. "@ PERSON2 said hesitantly in his voice." @ CAPS4 think about all the good times we had? all the laughs and happy times we've had ? "I started to smile, just thinking about all those times we've had." @ CAPS5 yeah, @ CAPS4 is that far from us? "@ PERSON2 Said." @ CAPS6 we do, as long as we don't have anything wrong with ourselves. hehe “I said knowing he was slowly changing his mind.” @ CAPS7 now I know I need you. he says laughing in the background. After that night everything was fine, for a while. and things with my family and his family made it hard for us to be together. @ CAPS4 we did this for a while. a year and a half. @ CAPS4 even after a year and a half of our lives we still couldn't do it. Laughter or the good times never kept us together. @ CAPS4 it kept us together for so long. The Laughing has had a big impact in this relationship and I thank God that it is. Even on this changeable day, I can still look back and laugh at all the good and funny times we had together. Laughter can keep two people going far away together, @ CAPS4 the real question is how long can that laughter keep them together? For a day? A year? Three years? Or maybe a lifetime? Only time could tell .

When you laugh, is @ CAPS5 out of habit, or is @ CAPS1 the cause ? What are the causes of laughter? @ CAPS1 is it even a "cause" to laugh ? I'm sure if you were to get the advice of a scientist you would have a thorough technical explanation of what causes laughter ; but does that mean that laughter is just a message sent from the brain to the muscles involved? Certainly not! The real cause is what has been said or done to cause the brain to send the message to the muscles necessary to physically make a person laugh. So what makes people laugh? A funny joke, some crazy action, a misunderstanding? @ CAPS5 can be anything! Without a doubt, one thing that makes people laugh is having a good time with a friend or two. @ DATE1, @ CAPS3 older sister @ PERSON4 and I went on an adventure without knowing it. We headed over to @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION1 to visit our best friends, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON3, who turned out to be almost completely identical to @ CAPS3's sister and me in personality ; @ PERSON2 being like @ PERSON4 and @ PERSON3 being like me. Now, every time the four of us got together, @ CAPS1 wouldn't say what kind of humorous, crazy memories we would all come home with; all we knew was spending time together @ CAPS8 failed to brighten up our days or make us smile. That day @ PERSON3 and I were in desperate need of each other's attention and good humor. She and I both had a rough time with friends in our schools (oddly enough, we both had friendship issues with someone called @ PERSON1, and we hadn't even gone in the same school), so after a discussion between our two groups of parents, they agreed that @ PERSON2 would come and get @ LOCATION3, @ PERSON4 would come and get me, and well all meet somewhere to forget the antagonistic situations that the two were undergoing . We decided to meet at @ LOCATION2, at @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON3. When we pulled into their driveway I could feel @ CAPS3's body filled with excitement, as if the emotion was trapped inside some sort of storage container inside of me that was. too small to contain all of the content contained therein. Before the car engine was completely turned off the seat belt @ CAPS3 was off and I was halfway to the car door. I slammed @ CAPS5 shut once @ CAPS3's body cleared and rushed for the door. To @ CAPS3's surprise, @ CAPS5 has been unlocked ! I pushed @ CAPS5 open yelling obnoxiously, "I'm heeeeeeeereeeeeeee!" @ CAPS1 was a laughter that filled the room. I squeezed them both into a tight squeeze, and almost as if @ PERSON3 and I were planning our next move, we immediately started discussing the incidents that had occurred that day as we sat on the floor. couch. All we could hear was "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4! I have to tell you what happened today !" and "I can't believe she said that!" or "... and she said ... and then I was like ... so she said ..." @ CAPS5 it felt like we took the life of a dramatic teenager straight out of the movie theater . Things were going normally; @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON4 living near @ PERSON3 and I in the dining room at the back of the couch where she and I were sitting, still fully involved in our similar worlds of freshman high school. They were completely immersed in their own conversations about the old memories we had together. All of a sudden @ PERSON2 yells: "@ CAPS2! @ PERSON3 and I made you brownies!" @ CAPS7 off guard by his intejection, we all burst out laughing yet again, although this time we were heading to the kitchen in search of said brownies. When we arrived, @ CAPS1 put a pan of brownies on the middle counter. @ PERSON3 found out @ CAPS5 and gave each of us a napkin with a brownie sitting on it. We were together, leaning against the tiled counters, enjoying our brownies and each other's company. Suddenly @ CAPS1 was a dull moment; nobody said anything. As if to fill the silence before time runs out, @ PERSON2 blurted out : "@ PERSON4, are you wearing a wig ?" @ CAPS8 in our lives, did any of us laugh as hard as then. @ PERSON3 fell to the ground, @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON4 were leaning on each other to avoid falling, and I was completely doubled over, desperately trying to keep the sip of milk I had just taken in. the mouth of @ CAPS3. The minutes passed and we still laughed at the false remark. To this day, @ PERSON4 and I look back on that afternoon and the laughter that was shared with us and our very, very best friends.

                               Trippin 'on fences I'm @ NUM1 years old, and during those short @ NUM1 years, all I remember is laughing hysterically. Whether it's about something stupid I did, or my best friend doing something stupid, or most of the time when we got together and did something outrageous. Someone once said "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." With my best friend @ ORGANIZATION2 and I, this is exactly the case. I always have a great abs workout every time I'm with her, because I'm always laughing out loud. It was my school year @ NUM3 at @ ORGANIZATION1 here at @ LOCATION1, @ ORGANIZATION3. I was hanging out with my best friend @ ORGANIZATION2 during our lunch break outside. I was showing her my new jeans that I had just received the day before, at @ LOCATION2. I was also telling him about a note that had been passed to me, by a boy who had apparently had a crush on me for a while, this boy had also asked me to come out on the note. @ ORGANIZATION2 had asked me if she could see it, when I handed it to her all of a sudden she threw the note over the fence. Obviously the guy didn't have the approval of @ ORGANIZATION2. I couldn't leave the guy unanswered, especially when back then I liked him back. I begged @ ORGANIZATION2 to return my note to me, but she refused. What was I supposed to do, just leave an unanswered note on the other side of the fence ? No. The only solution was to jump over the fence and grab it. So me, in my new jeans I might add, practically straddled the fence and tore a big hole on the inside of my thigh, in my brand new jeans. I was so angry. I grabbed the note and climbed the fence in my new improved hobo jeans. On the way back I lost my balance and fell off the fence. I ended up losing the note again and crashing headfirst into a pile of mud and pine cones. What an idiot I was, I climbed that stupid fence, ripped my jeans, crossed them out and lost my balance, and lost it again. I was so frustrated with myself that I started to laugh. I don't know if it was because I was embarrassed or what, but I randomly started to crack. Then @ ORGANIZATION2 started to laugh, and when she laughs I laugh, because her laugh is so infectious. Soon we were both laughing hysterically like morons. “Laughter was really the shortest distance between two people” that day. Even though I probably should have been angry ... But why do this when @ CAPS1 can just laugh about it ? This is life, living. With this silly but funny memory, he will stay with me forever. Especially now that @ ORGANIZATION2 has moved. This @ MONTH1 sounds silly, but it was funny to us. Guess that was really one of those “@ CAPS1 had to be there” moments. But it reminds me of the good old days with @ ORGANIZATION2. It's good to have memories filled with laughter. If @ CAPS1 doesn't, your life can almost seem boring without it. Even though @ CAPS1 doesn't care about the smallest things in life. That's why for me anyway, "Laughter is the shortest distance between two people".

 Many people believe that laughter can improve your life. Laughter releases endorphins that give your body energy for daily activities. Relationships are generally better if both people are happy. Happiness is like shaking a bottle of soda. Happy emotions build up in your body and when shaken, release yourself with an explosion of positive emotions such as laughter. When I was born my mom said I was the chubby baby in the world. As she said this, she laughed, constantly thinking that I would eventually become a young adult. I laughed in the backseat of the car as we walked home together. My mom, who laughed all the time until her eyes filled with tears, taught me to laugh every chance I had. During my childhood years, I laughed, laughed and laughed until my teenage years. As I entered my teens I was diagnosed with @ CAPS1 from @ ORGANIZATION1 a mild autistic @ CAPS1 who has a variation of side effects. Some people who have @ CAPS1 from @ ORGANIZATION1 develop cases where their emotions do not show up physically. This case is similar to the physical characteristics of @ CAPS3 @ CAPS1. My main case with the @ CAPS1 of @ ORGANIZATION1 is that I am not receiving all the information given to me at the same time. When people tell me a joke that they find hilarious, I tend to miss the important parts of the joke, which are funny. As the joke comes to an end, everyone around me laughs, but I'm there with a blank look on my face. Sometimes I tell people I can't laugh. Even though I say this, I know it's not true. I can laugh, it's just really hard for me to find the right time. Most of the time I laugh at a situation that really isn't funny and everyone has blank eyes on their faces. It usually makes me embarrassed and I don't feel normal. A lot of people tell me that I look expressionless and then try to cheer me up or smile. I don't feel the need to smile, even in the happy times of my life. I didn't laugh enough, but I learned to turn bad situations into good and happy ones. Learning that I can laugh at any time is important. Even if there is no joke to tell, I can laugh. Most people would probably look at me in a weird way, but I don't care because I'm the one who feels the happiness inside. Laughing relieves stress, makes others feel good, and makes people with intellectual disabilities feel more comfortable in the community in which they live. I finally learned that even with @ CAPS1 from @ ORGANIZATION1, I can laugh as much as anyone.
