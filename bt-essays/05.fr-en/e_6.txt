It changes the mood for the greatness and altruism of the parents.

In the memoirs "Narciso Rodriguez" by Narciso Rodriguez, many moods were created such as upbeat, happy and exciting. The first mood the brief showed was upbeat. "Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mingling with the aromas of the cuisine." It was a very upbeat and welcoming tune to listen to in the kitchen rather than talking or being silent. The second mood displayed in this memoir was happiness. "All these cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship." It is a happy thought and a time when different cultures can come together to have a friendship. The last mood the brief depicts is excitement.

In the memoirs, the author creates a loving, caring and friendly atmosphere. He creates this atmosphere by describing the atmosphere of his house. "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that embraced both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."

The mood and memories of Narciso Rodriguez were love and respect. Narciso loved his family so much, and he learned that family doesn't just include blood relatives. Narciso's family included the friends he had made live in his neighborhood. The majority of Narciso's love has gone to his parents. He loved them for selflessly coming to @ LOCATION1 just to give it a better life. They were motivated by the fact that they were giving their son a great life, despite the fact that their jobs were not the best. He loved them for sacrificing their home, family and friends in Cuba just for him. Most of all, he loved them for teaching him two very important things: the spirit of generosity and the importance of family and friends. Her parents also taught her courage by not being afraid to come to @ LOCATION1. He constantly thanked his parents and told him he wouldn't have been so brave. All of Narciso's undying love and gratitude piled up, and it's clear to see how much Narciso respected his parents.          

<START>

 

The atmosphere described by the author was warm and full of happiness. In the memoir, author @ ORGANIZATION1 talks about the importance of his family which always brings a sense of comfort. He shared that he "was born in a blond brick apartment building for two families in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey" but that it didn't matter where he lived but who he lived with. The vibe you get when you read this memoir is mixed because of the way it describes his parents' life, his life and his home. When he says "the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed the two, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home," he speaks of their closeness and from that, that is what matters, when you read that you feel the comfort, the happiness, the joy and the compassion that he feels towards his life, his parents and all those around him.    

<START>

 

The mood of this memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez's parents both moved to @ LOCATION2 from Cuba to give their children a better life than the one they had. Narciso's parents lived in a one-room house until they moved to New Jersey, where Narciso grew up. Inside this house, the family has created a beautiful Cuban community. The heart of the house was the kitchen. Where they played Cuban music all the time. The part of New Jersey where the Rodriguez family lived was filled with immigrants from Spain, Cuba and Italy. The community was like a big family, “cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship”. All of these cultures that came together really showed Narciso what a "family" really means. She would never have known what it was or would never have had these opportunities if her parents had not been selfless. They came here and had to start their lives over. As Narciso says "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."

In the memoir, "Narciso Rodriguez", the @ CAPS1 creates a mood in this memoir. “ Growing up in this environment instilled in me the feeling that ' family ' had nothing to do with being blood related. " That means people who were not related by blood, he still considers himself a family. He also says "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." It meant that Evan, even though it wasn't a beautiful house, it was still his home and he loved it. The mood of this memory is love and he will never forget it. That's the kind of vibe in this brief.

The mood created by the author in the thesis. He felt @ CAPS1 and curious, my mom and dad had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in the country they loved. their native tropics and facing cultural challenges.  

<START>

 

The mood in "Narciso Rodriguez" is very subtle and can be nondescript. I say this because when I read this I didn't feel anything @ CAPS1 I thought about it. The article gave off a very comforting mood. As he said in the memoir, “ Growing up in this environment gave me a great feeling that ' family ' doesn't care about being a blood parent. " (@ CAPS2 the beginning of paragraph @ NUM1) This statement creates an atmosphere where a small audience in your head says" @ CAPS3 I had never thought of that before. " This memoir doesn't give blunt moobs like happy or sad, it gets you thinking. There was never a really sad moment in all of this. At the end of the @ NUM2 paragraph he says "I'll never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home." This quote is another example of giving a very nondescript mood, I say it's nondescript because you just can't express it in words about how you are feeling. So, in conclusion, the ambience this room gives is indefinable.             

<START>

 

The atmosphere created by the author is respectful. The atmosphere is respectful as they came from Cuba and went to @ LOCATION1. as @ CAPS1 says "My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture". Another reason the vibe is respectful is that the mother and father went to this country for their child. As @ CAPS1 says "They came selflessly, like many immigrants, to give their children a better life." This shows that they moved for the child and not for themselves.     

<START>

 

I think the overall feel of the brief is grateful. Towards the end, he says "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." Plus, he doesn't speak much evil. He only brushes it briefly. For the rest of the memoirs, he explains how wonderful his life has been and that he has always had family around him.    

<START>

 

In the article, the author tries to say how good his past was. The vibe of the article is that it was about happy memories and the smell of her mother's cooking and memories.

In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez", the author sets the mood was grateful for the cooking skills and love of his parents. One way the author is grateful is his cooking skills. The author is grateful for the cooking skills of his mother and father. For example. "My parents both shared cooking tasks and unwittingly passed on to me their rich cooking skills and a love of cooking that remains with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)." @ CAPS1 the way the author is grateful is the love of his parents. The author thanks his parents. For example. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." The author loves his parent for love and sacrifice.

The entire thesis has a very positive attitude. The author explains a feeling of unity and friendship. This quote shows this, "… all of these cultures have come together in great solidarity in friendship." The author says that despite living in a time of racism, all different cultures and their neighborhood lived in peace. The paragraph @ NUM1 has a feeling of benevolence. For others and for love.

In the memoir "Narciso Rodriguez" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is one of gratitude. Mood signifies the general atmosphere of the authors' words. I think it's happiness, because no matter what happens, Rodriguez is always grateful. She doesn't care to live in a simple house with a group of people, she is happy to have a home. In paragraph @ NUM1, she says, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." I would have admired her, for being so grateful and happy for what she has. Also, the last sentence she said, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a house." These are a perfect example of humor, great fullness, and joy.       

<START>

 

The atmosphere created by the author was structured around a lot of things. First off, it's a light, warm, and cheerful mood as the author describes how he grew up in a simple yet loving neighborhood. "Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that embraced both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home." There continues to be a friendly and cheerful mood throughout the memoir. However, he becomes grateful and grateful, when the author describes how "They [his parents] came selflessly, as do many immigrants, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving their children behind. family, friends and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Nordic winters while longing for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. " @ CAPS1, it creates an atmosphere that fluctuates and changes throughout the thesis. He goes from warm and fuzzy to grateful and vice versa.      

<START>

 

The mood created in memories is love and care, as this Cuban family lived in an apartment building @ NUM1 and now live in a bedroom apartment @ NUM2. Now they invite people to treat people and family members with love and care and it will rub the kids and it is a good thing that they did that and also that the neighborhood was good. 

<START>

 

The mood created by the author is that your family will always be there for you, a quote from the story is "I will never forget how my parents made this simple house into a home. The mood can also be qu 'there are always better opportunities in life. What I mean is that Narciso Rodriguez's parents moved to @ LOCATION1 for a better opportunity for their children. "This is where I learned the true definition of "family". the many things I learned there about how to love. "

<START>

 

I think the mood created by the author was a happy mood and a mood that makes you appreciate what you have. And to always remember where you come from, and to always love family. At certain points in memories, the mood is more like @ CAPS1, for example in the "paragraph @ NUM1", he tells how his neighborhood growing up was made up of many races, including Spanish, Cuban and Italian, and he tells how they all came together in solidarity and friendship. He also says how his family always helped each other. In conclusion, I think the main mood in this brief would be @ CAPS1 and getting together, whether as a family or as individuals.

In this memoir, the author created a proud and happy mood. Author Narciso Rodriguez has shown how proud he is of his family and home through his memoir. His parents left their home to give him a better life and he is extremely proud and grateful for that. His parents also allowed other immigrants to stay with them temporarily. In paragraph @ NUM1 he says, "What they did was a much braver thing than I ever could have done." Narciso shows how happy he was to have grown up where he did. He had his parents, as well as all his neighbors, whom he considered to be his family. Although her apartment wasn't the nicest place to live, it was her home. He was happy there and always had people around him who loved him and took care of him. In paragraph @ NUM2, he says, "I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Narciso shows his proud and happy feelings through his memoirs.

The author's mood is @ CAPS1 and grateful because his parents left Cuba and were very nice people. They let people live in their homes. When they didn't have a lot of money, they took any job to be able to take care of their son, Narciso, they had a three bedroom apartment and they let the refugees celebrate their arrival in this country, they also had a home full of love and life. They also came to this country without knowing how to speak this language. So the mood of this story to the author seems to be proud of.    

<START>

 

I think the mood of the memoirs is heartwarming and happy because it tells about how a simple house became a home. The memoirs show how a family can turn a random house into a house one would love and selflessly letting people stay with them until they can get back on their feet. The memoirs also show how family has nothing to do with being related by blood, it's about being for each other when needed. I think it shows a lot of comfort and happiness, knowing that a simple apartment can become a house of love, filled with family and love.

The atmosphere created by the author in the memories is formidable.

In addition, @ CAPS2 will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @ CAPS2 has often told them how brave they are to let people in at home. @ CAPS2 loves them for their strength and perseverance, and @ CAPS2 has thanked them many times. But in reality, there is no way to express gratitude for the spirit of generosity and the leaned on him from a young age, and how @ CAPS2 knows how important family and friends are.

In memories, the mood seems to be happy and thankful.

"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I have often told them that what they did was a much braver thing than I ever could have done." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) It shows me that the author's mood is to be happy and in love and how extremely grateful he is to have them in his life. It also shows her love for what her parents taught her. “My parents both shared cooking tasks and unwittingly passed on to me their rich cooking skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)

     In the memoirs of Narciso Rodriguez, he included many stories about his "family" and his parents. The stories, along with the parentheses further expressing her opinion, created three main moods in memories. The atmospheres created by @ PERSON2 were happiness, humor and kindness. The mood of happiness is expressed when Narciso talks about his friends in the community and family. At dinner, when at least one of his extended family members joined him regularly, Narciso put on a very happy mood. During these meals that he and his family ate, they often laughed.

Another example can also be found in the @ NUM2 paragraph, where it is written : “ I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I often told them that what they had done was a much braver thing than I could have done. . “ It shows that she is a very loving and caring person to actually be @ CAPS1 for something your parents did.

The author of the memoir said, “ Growing up in this environment made me feel a great sense that ' family ' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. " Narciso Rodriguez was going to change the way a reader would perceive this memory.

For his neighborhood, including his family being immigrants, in an era of racism and segregation, @ CAPS1 has grown to appreciate this “close knit community of honest and hardworking immigrants.” @ CAPS1 understood how Narciso Rodriguez Sr, and @ ORGANIZATION2 has struggled personally and financially. @ CAPS1 became grateful for the opportunity to live in this Cuban home in Newark, New Jersey. Although his parents worked in a lab and studied chemical engineering, they are struggling to find work in these financial times. @ CAPS1 loves them. The author writes: "They showed me their life, and these teachings were the basis of my life." Without these relationships and the lives of various people, this memoir would be the selfish story of a child. @ CAPS1 appreciates everything the family has done.

In this memoir, the author has created more than one mood. It has, in my opinion, created about three. Love, gratitude and charity. The atmosphere of love was created because in the memories, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that the family is not only blood relatives. It can be anyone. In her case, her entire neighborhood was her family. Family can be anyone and for me family is or can be loved ones. This is how the mood of love was created by the author. When I read the memoirs and reached the end, I personally felt a mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all his parents did for him, an example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did this for me so I could relate on a personal level. I know I am grateful to them for making this great decision. I also think that the atmosphere of benevolence has been created. I think because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until "they get back on their feet." I felt like the family cared about doing this, it's not like anyone would, so the family cared. This is why I felt that the benevolent mood had been created by the author.

I think parents give up just like house, food, Cuba and everything else just so that their kids go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be close to family and everything to make their kids happy. It's a lot of work to have all of this especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is that with their owner they set the table and eat great food, have fun and have fun.

Narciso Rodriguez put a strong mood of happiness and gratitude in his memories. He especially thanked his parents for passing on their culinary skills to him.

In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir "Narciso Rodriguez", Narciso's mood in the memories seemed happy and gratifying. Narciso's mood seemed happy because when he told us (the readers) about his life in Newark, New Jersey and how his house was like, he was saying how nice his landlord and daughter were and how the house was. The owner's daughter was his first friend, and he also said how close his family and friends were. In the neighborhood it was despite customs elsewhere, all cultures came together in great solidarity (happiness) and friendship. His mother and father made the house comfortable and at the end of the memoir the author said, “I will never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a house, which means he did never had a house like the one he lived in now.   

<START>

 

In this brief, I think the atmosphere is warm and pleasant. An example of how warm he is is how he describes the house. For example, it says in paragraph @ NUM1. "Within the walls, my young parents created a traditional Cuban house, the very heart of which was the kitchen." It's a cozy atmosphere, because when you think of a kitchen, you think of a warm room with the sweet smells of delicious baked dishes. One of the reasons it's a good mood is because all cultures got along and treated each other like family. . For example, it says in paragraph @ NUM2, "All our cultures have come together in great solidarity and friendship." This is good because there was a lot of racism back then and all cultures overcame it together. The last reason there is a warm and pleasant mood is how he appreciates what his parents have done. For example, it says in paragraph @ NUM3, "I have told them many times that what they have done is a much braver thing than I ever could have done." This means that he is grateful that his parents left Cuba to give him a better life. This is why I think that the atmosphere of the memoirs is warm and pleasant.       

<START>

 

The mood in this brief is very relaxed and proud. The author has shown that he is so proud of his parents and his culture. He spoke with a relaxed feeling and loved everything about his home and culture. Also the mood is so grateful. He is so grateful to his neighbors and the way they have all come together.

He said that "for which I am eternally grateful" also, "which I still adore today". There are many different ways to set the mood by the author in the memoir.      

<START>

 

The mood created by memory is grandeur. I think this is because it's one of the words he uses over and over again to show emphasis. Narciso says "... And for which I am eternally grateful. (Paragraph @ NUM1).

The mood that the author of the memoirs created was good by his love, his blood relative and also by his courage. For starters, her love is like a part of her life. He loves his parents. For example, in the story, say " I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and their sacrifices ." @ CAPS1 that means she loves her parent for every little thing they've done. He also learns to love people. Just like his blood relative, which means he @ CAPS2 has nothing to do with any of this. She is originally from Cuba and arrived in the United States in 1956. She was also born in a simple house. This is how the author describes the atmosphere, by his love, his blood relationship, and also by his courage.

In the memory many moods were expressed. I think the mood that was expressed the most was happiness. Narciso described to us that no matter what, his family and close friends would always feel a sense of belonging to each other. It gave everyone in the story a good reason to be happy and feel good about themselves and each other. In conclusion, the strongest mood in history was happiness.    

<START>

 

In the memory of the story, the author created two different moods to describe the story. The first mood was the great fullness. The author described the great wholeness of parents when he described the selflessness and care given to parents when they made the decision to move to @ LOCATION1 to give them a better life. The last mood described by the author was joy. The author described the happiness in the story when he described parents making everyone feel at home These are the different moods described in the story by the author.

In the memoirs, Narciso Rodriguez, of Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, talks about the life of fashion designers and the atmosphere created by the author. After his parents immigrated from Cuba, Narciso was very grateful. “I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice” (paragraph six). Narciso believes a lot in his Cuban heritage. coming to @ LOCATION1 his neighborhood was full of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants. Everything he considered his family. He was grateful for the life, friends and family support his family gave him. His parents had shown this with their lives, and these teachings were the basis of his life. Narciso is grateful for coming to @ LOCATION1 and bringing his old home in Cuba to his new home at @ LOCATION1.

In this memoir, the atmosphere created by the author is very positive. The author turns @ CAPS1 not good into a much better thing. Like when they had a very small house, they turned it into a house. The inhabitants of this little house let the people stay with them until they get back on their feet. These people who made up the whole building feel much better keeping their old culture.

The vibe is @ CAPS1 in many ways. First, the vibe in this @ CAPS2 is @ CAPS1 like he's happy to immigrate to @ LOCATION1 Also his @ CAPS1 is sad, "... Even if that meant leaving family, friends and career behind. in the country where he loved, "another mood would be courageous. For me, these immigrants are courageous because I would never want to leave behind my friends and especially my family. Another mood is great. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." In conclusion, there are many ways the vibe is @ CAPS1 in this @ CAPS2.

Warmth In the memoir “ Narciso Rodriguez ”, the author created the mood in several ways. , the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations. ” It creates a cozy atmosphere because the kitchen seems to be a very friendly place due to the people gathering, knowing that they would do the same for us ". (paragraph @ NUM2) It is the manners of the author of "Narciso @ CAPS1" that set the mood in this story.

The @ CAPS1 puts a good mood in this memoir on his house. The @ CAPS1 declares that home is a sign of life and love. The @ CAPS1 declares, "always filled the air not only to perfume music, but also with life and love". The @ CAPS1 explains the ambiance with a Cuban feast. Also when he learns that in the neighborhood there is love to be made. The @ CAPS1 says, "And for that, I will never forget this gracious home or neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love." The @ CAPS1 shows how many cultures and countries show satisfaction across the neighborhood which is mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @ LOCATION 1. The @ CAPS1 shows a positive, generous good mood in the book that started it all in the kitchen with a Cuban feast.

The mood set in these memoirs by the author was great wholeness, and it seemed to thank his family for such a loving childhood. It also appears to be missing @ CAPS1. "I was born in this simple house" says @ CAPS1 "within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban house." @ CAPS1 was very comfortable in his home and @ CAPS1 loved it. It looks like the snippet was made to thank those who @ CAPS1 has lived with. As it says in paragraph @ NUM1 "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." @ CAPS2 the @ CAPS1 excerpt explains how caring and generous his family and neighbors were. "My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us." The author reports that his neighbor cooked delicious meals all the time, and their table consisted of many neighbors and blood relatives. The author had a very close relationship with his neighbors.

The mood I think the author created in memories was love. The reason I say love is because for me he cares about his family and he also stuck with his family tradition and he cares and follows them. He also loved being with his family. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1 of the article, it says ; “I will never forget this house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents made a simple house into a house. And for me, it shows love, that's why I think the author created love as his mood in the memories.

The mood created by the author is loving and happy for many reasons. It's loving because Narciso truly loves his family and is grateful to his parents for giving up their life, for giving him a better one, "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." He is happy because the global memories are with family and friends and his childhood was good. “Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great feeling that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. These are the greatest moods this memoir presents.

The atmosphere created in this memoir was for me family and love. for most of the memoirs, the author spoke of the experiences he had in the house and the love he had for his family and friends. The first example I have for the humor is when he says "like a lot of immigrants do, to give their children a better life". It shows the love of parents for children. a second example I have is for family when reading said “growing up in this environment has instilled in me a great feeling that“ family ”is community and parenting education for their children.

The mood in the author's story is joyful and grateful. Happy because even though it was a new country, they came with a purpose and live it with their culture which is passed down from family to family. “My mother and father came to this country with great courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if that meant leaving behind family, friends and careers in the country they loved. " Also grateful because he sees what his parents have done and done for him so that he can be happy. "I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice." "I was in the warmth of the kitchen of this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air not only with perfume and music, but also with life and love !"      

<START>

 

The atmosphere created by the author in the memories is proud. The author was proud because he was growing up as a loving and caring child in the United States. He was also proud that even though his family moved from Cuba to the United States, he still practices his Cuban culture. Another reason he was proud is that he has loving parents who want him to be successful in life. His parents helped him keep his culture by bringing her family. "My @ CAPS1 Bertha and Juanita and cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary ... we regularly joined at our table." (ph @ NUM1) This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez's family came to join him and his parents for dinner. The Narciso family gave up everything, including leaving Cuba so he could have a better life. A life his family can be proud of.

The mood of this memoir is non-fiction. The vibe is there because Narciso Rodriguez recounts his past in his own and the life he once lived in New Jersey, in a Cuban, Italian and Spanish neighborhood. The house was made into a home by his parents, surrogate grandparents and himself. The house he lived in was a blond brick apartment, filled with Cuban aromas and Cuban music. The mood turned cheerful because of the family's love for Cuban music and Cuban cuisine (which is really good). The atmosphere is also represented with the Family, a loving and caring family in a beautiful apartment building. The vibe is non-fiction, cheerful, loving and caring, I know that because the "house" is so nice to be inside.

In the memoirs "Narciso Rodriguez", the mood created by the author was loving, caring and grateful. loving is what they did the most because they called everyone their family. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1, it says that "My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we call family, knowing that they would do the same for us." Another mood was caring, as they wanted their children to have better lives. An example is "My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give their children a better life, leaving their friends, their families and their careers in the country they loved." It shows that they care about their children. One last mood is grateful. “The barriers to work were strong and high, my parents had to accept that they couldn't both find the work they deserved, they had to start their lives over.

The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to dock the airships to the Empire State Building. Safety was an issue with airships due to the highly flammable hydrogen gas. So, if the airships exploded over New York City, many people could be killed in this densely populated area. Another problem is keeping the @ CAPS1 derigible so people can descend while the wind moves the back of itself. The only way was to attach lead weights to the back of the airship, but it would be dangerous for the people below. So, these obstacles faced by the workers never got past them and hence they built the tallest soda fountain and tea garden in the world for tourists in the observation area.

Him from the start, there would have been many problems allowing airships to moor a few @ NUM1 feet in the air. The major problem here would be that the Empire State Building was being built in New York City, a heavily populated area. Below the mooring mast were several other buildings where other people worked and lived. If anything happened while the airship was attempting to dock, it could destroy the building and the lives of those in it. Not only that, but below were the city streets, where pedestrians walked. In paragraphs @ NUM2, the passage also talks about the stress of a heavy steel-framed airship moored to the top of the building. The frame had to be very dense and, as the project architects discovered, expensive. Other safety concerns include high winds that would cause airships to drift off course and the safety of the airships themselves. The passage mentions the Hindenburg incident, as well as the concern of the owners of the building that it will occur in such a densely populated area.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. one obstacle was that the airship would have to be held by a single tether cable. It would add stress to the frame of the building in order to make the frame strong, there were modifications to the frame of the building which cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle encountered by the manufacturers was the use by the airship of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Since New York was a densely populated area, it wouldn't work well. Airships should also be ballasted at the rear with lead weights. To do this, the lead weights would end up hanging over pedestrians on the street, which was a safety concern. A final hurdle that manufacturers faced was the law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This law prohibited a vessel from mooring to the vessel or approaching the area.

In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in the construction of the Empire State Building, allowing airships to dock there. years in power) had made the tower tall ... The height of the building was 1,250 feet. But after nearly losing the title of the tallest tower in the world, he announced that there would be a top or a hat on the tower. Another reason is the The Tower was designed for airships (airships) that could @ CAPS2 people from New York to New Jersey. Smith wanted a place where the airships could dock. But that never happened because the German airship "Hindenburg" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and on May 6, 1937, the owners of the State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been. if it had happened over New York. in the 1930s, the idea was scrapped after another airship attempted to perform a stunt. The Empire State Building has never managed to describe what it was designed to do.    

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it illegal for the airship to dock on the building. Another obstacle encountered in allowing airships to dock was safety. Most airships used hydrogen which was highly flammable. If an airship caught fire over the densely populated area of New York City, there would be a good chance that many people would be injured. A final obstacle encountered was "nature itself". The winds atop the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to the strong air currents. Even if an airship would be attached to the mooring mast, the rear of the mooring mast would move dangerously around the mooring mast. Many obstacles were encountered by the workers of the Empire State Building in order to allow an airship to dock there.         

<START>

 

Soon after its design, the Empire State Building's mooring mast was doomed. The first obstacles were easily overcome, for example the problem of additional stress on the building frame caused by the additional weight of the moored airship. This was solved by structural modifications to the building's frame, an expensive but fairly straightforward procedure. one of the biggest blows to the project was the advent of the Hindenburg disaster. The Hindenburg disaster caused a decline in airships. Airplanes have become a safer, faster and more stylish means of transport. In addition to the Hindenburg disaster, it soon became apparent that docking and airship at @ NUM1 or higher was not feasible. Strong winds would not allow the airship to maintain its course and the ship would be blown erratically around the mast. The final nail in the mooring mast's coffin was a law prohibiting airship travel over urban areas. These multiple factors easily dismissed any possibility of success in airship travel in the future.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire @ CAPS1 Building encountered obstacles as they attempted to allow the derigibles to dock there. The architects realized that they could not put the mooring mast above the building without modifying and strengthening the steel frame of the building. The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure would add too much weight to the frame which could cause it to collapse. They reinforced the framing from the bottom of the building to the top before placing the shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower on top of the building. The builders faced these hurdles, but they managed to achieve their goal. The mooring mast is not used as a docking station, but it is still considered the final piece that makes the Empire State Building stand out from all buildings in downtown New York City.     

<START>

 

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many complications arose during the plans and construction of the attempted mooring mast. One obstacle was that the airships were just too heavy and the building's metal frame would have to be altered. After repairing the framework of the Empire State Building, two tests were carried out by the airship @ ORGANIZATION3 "Los Angeles" and the airship Goodyear "Columbia". The result of the exhalation was that the current of the wind, physically, did not allow the airship to come close enough to the building to dock. In addition, "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban cities" was an obstacle they could not overcome. A few years after postponing their efforts, planes gave way and airships, as a means of transportation, were long forgotten.    

<START>

 

The obstacles that manufacturers face were great. They explained how most of the airships outside of @ LOCATION1 use a different gas called hydrogen which is highly flammable. Then they told @ LOCATION1 how Hindenburg caught fire in 1937, which used hydrogen. They realized that if it had happened in an urban area, it could have been worse. Anthore the obstacle they faced was the wind. If the airship was parked at the mooring mast, the strong wind speeds would cause the airship to move and strain the steel frame of the building. The biggest obstacle was the law passed. The law stipulated that no airship could fly too low in urban areas. That would prevent airships from landing there.        

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building have a great idea. They wanted to be able to attach airships, or airships, to the top of the building. However, there were a lot of problems with this idea. First of all, the airships themselves weren't very sturdy. Strong winds could easily blow airships trying to moor in the spiers of other buildings. Airships also began to use hydrogen gas rather than helium. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable. The slightest spark could ignite the entire airship. The reception system itself was also a problem. The only way to maintain an airship level was to hang lead weights on the side. One concern was that a path could fall and fall into the densely populated city below. It could have turned out to be very catastrophic!           

<START>

 

The Empire State Building docking area was a beautiful and original idea in its design, but it was too difficult to implement. Al Smith, who led the operation, was too anxious to complete it. Since not enough time was spent researching the risks and structure of the dock, the plan to mount it to the top of the Empire State Building was already a failure. Even before construction started, the problems started to occur. The building could not withstand the stress of the airship @ DATE1 foot long. The shock to the building would have transmitted enormous pressure to the foundation. The roof should therefore be redone so that it is structurally sound. After several months and @ NUM1 dollars, the creation of the landing stage could begin. Life is precious and the landing stage was too unstable and dangerous to be used. Architects overlooked the fact that most aliens are made of hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable. In @ LOCATION1, the Hindenburg, which was built using hydrogen, caught fire and killed hundreds of people. There was even a law stating that planes could not be suspended so close to an urban area. The idea was ostentatious and flashy but because it was rushed, precautions were not taken into account. The obstacles facing the docking station were too great, so eventually the plan to erect it was abandoned.

When building the Empire State Building to allow airships to dock, builders were constantly faced with obstacles. Architects couldn't place a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. @ NUM1 ft airships would add stress to the frame of buildings, forcing architects to modify the frame. It would cost them extra @ MONEY1 for the changes. Architects are uncertain whether these changes will help. Safety is another concern. Foreign airships used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. For example, " When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had been. place above a densely populated area. like downtown New York. " The architects also had to be concerned about @ ORGANIZATION2 and the constant shifting of winds due to strong air currents. " Even though the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the aft pivoterait around and around the mooring mast. " airships @ CAPS1 land in open fields where they are weighed down not drift unless it is impossible to weigh the blimp in the air. they hang above pedestrians walking in the streets, which makes them dangerous. There is also the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. "This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to a ship. building or even approaching the area. " There were two attempts to dock on the building. @ NUM2 was in December 1930, the airship @ ORGANIZATION3 Los Angeles attempted to dock, except that it didn could not get close enough to the high speed winds. "At the end of the 193s 0, the idea of using the mooring mast for airships and their passengers had quietly disappeared. " Airplanes have become the future.                  

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to build this wonderful building. . As stated in the text “ The steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation. More than @ MONEY1 of modifications had to be made to the building frame. » @ CAPS1 the building had to be modified in several ways to make it stable enough for the airship to dock. Another obstacle was the weather above the building which was very strong winds and drafts. That would mean the airship would simply be "hanging over pedestrians on the street" and it's not a sure thing to have highly flammable hydrogen floating above millions of people. Another obstacle to these airships was the amount of time and effort they had to put into learning how to set up a mooring mast safely. It forced people to consult professionals like the Navy and find the right way. The Empire State Building's mooring mast caused many obstacles in the way.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow airships to tie up to the mooring mast. Al Smith was the architect and the man behind the idea for the Empire State Building. He and the builder of the Chrysler building were competing to build the tallest building in the world. To make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler Building, Smith was going to build something that John Tauranac said: "Would be outfitted for an era of transportation that was just the dream of aviation pioneers." This dream was to travel by airship. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for the dock of aerial ships. It wasn't going to be as easy as the concept. The architects could not drop a mooring mass on the roof because it would stress the structure of the building. The biggest reason the mast would never fulfill its destiny was safety. The excerpt reads : "Most of the derigibles used hydrogen." Hydrogen is flammable. There was also a law which was “against planes flying too low over urban areas”. After many attempts and modifications, the idea was abandoned.             

<START>

 

The hurdles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were the lack of a suitable landing zone. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow the airship to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and allow passengers to climb and descend, the electric winch, which hoisted in a line forward. of the ship, then attacked it at a mast. The airship body could sway in the breeze and passengers could safely get on and off the airship by descending a gang @ CAPS1 to an open observation deck. They from the Empire State Building consulted with experts, making tours of the US Naval Air Base's equipment and docking operations at Lakehurst, New Jersey.   

<START>

 

Marcia Amidon Lüsted's @ CAPS1 The Mooring Mast, shows the thoughtful, clever but nonetheless obstructed ideas of attaching a landing dock to the Empire State Building. The hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome were that the wind speeds where the airships would land were too high and would spin the balloon like a rag doll. They "would have to use lead weights" which would pose another problem, jeopardizing the foundation of the building. The weight of the building as well as the weight of the lead weights could collapse the structure. The gases they use "hydrogen and hellium" make the balloon fly, but hydrogen "is very flammable and cannot be used in populated areas." There was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas." @ CAPS2 are the obstacles and the reason why "the Empire State Building mooring mast was never intended to serve its purpose".      

<START>

 

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's excerpt, The Mooring Mast, there were many obstacles that made the engineers of the Empire State Building look for a new way to moor airships. One of the obstacles they had to face was the metal frame of the building. The wind pressure and the load of the airships had cost the company @ MONEY1. Second, they had to design some special floors for the airship passengers. A floor would be reserved for luggage and suitcases while a special observation deck was set up for passengers to exit or enter the ship. Finally, the building would now have 102 floors and is expected to be very durable, so special materials had to be brought in and used to create the building. Overall, the engineers of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles while constructing the 1,250-foot building.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State buildings had many problems allowing airships to dock there. Things like wind, actual mooring, and people getting off safely. The actual mooring was not practical, it would be almost impossible to connect the winch. The wind was the main reason for the mast's fate. First of all, the wind was so strong that the pilot would have a hard time getting close enough. The captain of the Los Angeles Navy Blimp approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to moor due to the high winds. Also, although he could moor , the rear of the airship would have overturned violently. The builders were therefore faced with an impractical task         

<START>

 

The first obstacle he faced in having to rebuild the body structure so that it could support the mooring mast, the second is that airships in other countries have used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. The third reason that should have come up from the start was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. The last reason is that the windy conditions at this height made it impossible for the airships to land there without the tail and swaying in the wind.  

<START>

 

The obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock with it are stresses on the building's framing. The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure had to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The Empire State Building's metal framework should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation. More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the building.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. A major obstacle was the construction of a mooring mast which would not threaten the structure of the building. The builders had to modify and reinforce the framework of the Empire State Building. According to the excerpt, "over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the frame." Another big obstacle was security. At the Empire State Building, it would have been illegal to land with an airship. Airships, at that time, were filled with hydrogen. If the airship ever exploded, it would threaten hundreds of people. of pedestrians on the streets of New York.

The builders of the @ ORGANIZATION1 encountered many obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. “ The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. " Winds of the current would lead the airship building with him because the current wind is very strong. The weight of the airship and the pressure of the wind can cause the building to collapse. "Al Smith realized that he was on the verge of losing the title of tallest building in the world, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building would now reach the height of 1,250 feet.

The larger the building, the stronger the wind flow, the more it will add to the building. hanging over pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe.

In the reading The Mooring Mast written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building hit a roadblock. What tried to allow the Airships to moor there. Not to mention that airships were considered the transport of the future. First, "The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone" (@ NUM1). This quote shows that for one, this airship should find a suitable landing zone. In addition to not being able to adapt. Thus, there was a need for more surface space. In addition, "some were up to a thousand feet, the same length as four city blocks in New York" (@ NUM2). It seemed that there was not enough space due to the length of the airship. It also shows how these architects would come up with a plan to make this job, that way it would fit properly. Therefore, there was an obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. What was the lack of a suitable area.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced difficult circumstances and many obstacles when designing a brand new Empire State Building to accompany this new means of travel. The builder's mission was to design the top of the Empire State Building to accommodate the mooring of airships over a thousand feet in the air. The first obstacle was the design of a landing pad. It was difficult because the necessary architecture had never been created or even attempted in the past. A second hurdle was having to make sure that the Empire State Building could withstand the stress created by the airship. The paragraph @ NUM1 says "The stress of the load of airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." The difficulty with this obstacle was having to refurbish the Empire State Building's steel framing, which took a lot of time, work and over sixty thousand dollars. “ The biggest obstacle to a successful mooring was nature itself. " There were violent wind currents at the top of the building and airships were never very stable. There were a lot of pedestrians under a moored airship so it was a very dangerous obstacle. Finally, the pre-existing laws of airships flying low over urban areas posed a new problem. even with successful architecture, the laws banned airships in the first place ! Airplanes were also becoming more and more popular.

While building the Empire State Building, builders encountered problems allowing airships to dock with it. Some of the obstacles the builder encountered was actually having a way for the airships to moor about 1250 feet above the ground. Strong drafts and changing wind direction also made it difficult for pilots to steer airships close enough to the mast for docking. A final problem that manufacturers faced was a law that "airships flew too low over urban areas." (@ NUM1). Which basically means if it was docked with the Empire State Building then it would be too low for an urban area and it is against the law.

The idea of mooring airships atop the building that stood 1,250 feet above the streets of downtown New York was a fascinating and amazing idea. An idea that would bring New York into a whole “era of transport” (@ NUM1). Unfortunately, this wonderful idea had a few holes in the plans. Later, the architects who built the mooring mast discovered that their idea was not going to come true. The idea had too many obstacles to overcome. The fact that "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (@ NUM2). If anything were to go wrong, it would be catastrophic, for below them were heavily populated streets. In addition, "the biggest obstacle was nature itself" (@ NUM3). It was simply too windy to keep the aircraft stable and under control. The reality was that the idea of mooring derigibles sounded good, but there were too many risks involved in carrying out the plan.

In the excerpt "The Mooring @ CAPS1", by: Marcia Amidon @ CAPS2 the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. The Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill its function for many reasons and many obstacles. One of those many reasons was that most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. In addition, the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the morning mast was nature itself. Due to the fact that the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. Using them at the Empire State Building, where they would hang above pedestrians on the street, was neither convenient nor safe. The other obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for the ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two airships attempted to reach the building because the whole idea was scrapped. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles.

The builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle they faced was the issue of security. As noted in paragraph @ NUM1, most foreign airships used the flammable element hydrogen rather than helium. A fire would be very deadly in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the wind. In paragraph @ NUM2 it is written : "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts." The airship's unattached back would swing and even " pivot around the mooring mast ." When an airship is moored in the open, it can be ballasted with weights. Doing this outdoors on top of the Empire State Building would be dangerous due to pedestrians below. The last hurdle faced by manufacturers was the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @ NUM3, it says: "This law would make it illegal for a ship to moor at the building or even to approach the area ..." This is why the mooring mast of airships of the Empire State Building never served its purpose.

According to the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow airships to land there. One of the obstacles was the security concerns. The airships had to come close enough to the Empire State Building to be able to attach the airship. It put the airships too close to the people. There was a law that said airships could not fly low to urban areas. There was a disaster that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey that they were trying to prevent from happening in New York (paragraph @ NUM1). Another problem that builders faced was that the strong winds of nature did not allow airships to get close enough to attach to the mast. There were a lot of hurdles that the builders faced and in the end it wasn't worth making the Empire State Building into an airship dock.       

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow the airships to dock. The building's steel frame had to be altered and reinforced to make room for the airships at the dock. In addition, more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made. The last hurdle the builders encountered was that a thousand-foot airship moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's framing. It was not easy for the builders to build a mooring mast on top of the tallest building that measured one thousand two hundred and fifty feet, but the architects achieved their goal by designing the mooring mast.    

<START>

 

During the construction of the Empire State Building, workers faced many obstacles while trying to moor the airships to it. An airship attached to the mast and the building would add additional stress, so builders instead owed more than sixty thousand dollars in reconstructions to repair the framing of the buildings. The airships also moor with a line running from the front of the ship to the mast, and although they anticipated that the airship could sway in the wind, it was unrealistic that a ship could attach itself to the building by strong wind. Other obstacles they encountered in letting the airships dock with the vessel were due to safety hazards, the hydrogen used in most airships outside of the United States is highly flammable. The builders also did not take into consideration the pre-existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urbanized areas, so it was illegal for an airship to attach to the building. The task of having airships strapped to the Empire State Building was an impossible task at first.    

<START>

 

There were many reasons why architects had trouble allowing airships to dock on the Empire State Building. One problem was that most airships were @ NUM1ft long and that would be too much. There would only be one tether cable and that would add stress to the building frame. The entire steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened, which would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. The main reason why the mooring mast would never serve its purpose is safety. Most airships in the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of mooring was nature itself. The winds at the top of the buildings were constantly changing due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot. They're supposed to land on open playgrounds, but using them in the Empire State Building, where they would hang above pedestrians, wasn't safe.        

<START>

 

the obstacles that the builders threw used hydrogen which is flammable. Another is the " wind on the roof of the building which was constantly moving due to the strong drafts ". the third is when the stern of the ship swings around the mooring mast. last but not least the law prohibiting airships flying at low altitude over urban areas.     

<START>

 

There were many obstacles that the builders had to face in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was the wind. At higher altitude, the wind is much stronger. This would make it very difficult to accurately approach the airship near the mast. Also the structure of the Empire State Building. The frame was not built for the amount of weight that would be on top of the building. The builders did more than @ MONEY1 to fortify the framework. These are just a few hurdles that builders have faced in attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. Although the builders thought it was a brilliant idea, they did not carefully consider the safety risks they may have encountered and how unrealistic the idea was. One of the main reasons the mooring mast was destined to be unable to fulfill its purpose was safety concerns. In paragraph @ NUM1, it says "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen ... and hydrogen is highly flammable." When an airship was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse such an accident would be if it happened in such a densely populated place as downtown New York. Another very practical reason why airships could not dock at the top of the building was, as stated in paragraph @ NUM2, "there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas". This would make it impossible for even an airship to approach the area, let alone be able to attach to the building. It is very obvious that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems during this attempt.       

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building seem blind to any dangers that could arise from the mooring mast. A huge danger factor was the strong winds at this altitude. The airship would be swung on the tie going to the building, which could either damage the building itself or damage the airship. Also, if the airship was moving, how would the passengers get on and off ? They could fall off the loading dock whether or not they use the airship. Passengers could even be thrown from the open floor of the Empire State Building. Another factor was New York's high population, if something like debris fell on the streets it could likely kill a few pedestrians. I think the architects would have taken all of these factors into account before trying to start the project.

In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the construction of the Empire State Building faces many problems. One of those issues is that New York Governor Al Smith wanted the building to be the tallest in the world. To do this, you would need a mask to break the record. The mask made to make nature a danger to the whole building because of the violent draft. Another reason for the Empire State Building's failure is that it was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law came into effect because of a German airship that caught fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. These are just a few of the many problems airships have when passing the Empire State Building.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. A thousand foot airship, attached to a single tether cable, would add stress to framed buildings if the airship was placed on top of the building. The framework of buildings should be reinforced and modified to adapt to the situation. More than @ MONEY1 value of modifications should be installed in the frame. some other hurdles that manufacturers encountered were safety. The airships ran on hydrogen, which is flammable. Another obstacle was the weather. The winds moved to the top of the Empire State Building due to strong drafts. A final hurdle was an existing law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas. The idea of an airship quietly disappeared.         

<START>

 

Although Al Smith expected the Empire State Building's mooring mast to be unique and practical, builders encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock on it. First, in order for the building to withstand the stress that airships would add to the building frame, the building frame had to be altered. It cost over sixty thousand dollars. In addition, the airships used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. An accident could be fatal in a densely populated area like New York. Additionally, there were high winds at the top of the building which made docking difficult and could possibly blow an airship off the side of the building causing it to puncture. Finally, an existing law prohibited airships from flying at low altitude over urban areas; it would be illegal for a vessel to even approach the area of the vessel.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock. The biggest obstacle to using a mooring mast was the wind. At the top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. The winds would rotate the stern of the airship around the mooring mast. Another reason airships couldn't do more at the Empire State Building is that there is a law that says airships cannot fly low in urban areas. This would make it illegal for the airship to approach or dock with the Empire State Building.     

<START>

 

According to the story, it all started when they built the Empire State Building and the workers should have known that the building was too big for the windy climate, high in the sky and besides, when you are building. a building like this, you have to make sure it's strong enough to keep your balance. They faced issues like when the United States tried to make a deal with them if they would let them use the top of the building as a wharf to leave civilians on the bridge, and after passing a law banning airships. to land on the quay. an airship attempted to land on the wharf.

In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there are described. One obstacle was that most airships were highly flammable. In paragraph @ NUM1 it says : "Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." If an airship caught fire near the Empire State Building, the accident would affect many people as it is a densely populated area. Another obstacle that the builders faced were the winds of nature itself. Even if an airship was docked, it would still pivot too much. In paragraph @ NUM2 it is written : " ... they would be hung over pedestrians in the street, it was neither practical nor safe." " Another obstacle they faced was an existing law. In paragraph @ NUM3 it says, "The other practical reason airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas." The architects faced many obstacles while trying to make their idea a reality. It's best to plan ahead and think about each obstacle before bringing ideas to life.              

<START>

 

The builders struggled a lot because of where it was and how the airship had to dock. Their first problem was the fact that it was so big that it was difficult to work on it. Another problem was that the airship was approaching the building, so it had to be reinforced. The final issues that made it an unreliable choice were the windy conditions and the fact that the tail of the airship could swing freely. All of this helped make the Empire State Building mast a bad idea.

According to The Mooring Mast excerpt, the architects who built the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. by trying to allow drigibles to moor there. One obstacle they faced when trying to let the dribbles tie up there was the winds. As it says in the excerpt, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts. Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot ..." The airship would not be stable. Another hurdle they faced was weighing it down, they would have to use a lead weight, but it wouldn't be "convenient or safe" hanging over people at @ LOCATION1 on the street. Overall, architects faced many obstacles in docking airships, most of which were either practical or insecure.     

<START>

 

There were many issues with allowing airships to land on top of the Empire State Building. When designing the mast, they realized that with the weight of the airship, the frame of the building would be under stress. (paragraph @ NUM1) They also noticed that airships from other countries used hydrogen and not helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @ NUM2). One factor in the mast construction that was beyond the control of the builders was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. (paragraph @ NUM3). The law was also a problem when it came to building the mast. There was a law banning airships flying low over urban areas. (paragraph @ NUM4). Along with the factors of weight, gas, nature and law, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles.           

<START>

 

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, recounts the original purpose of the mast on top of the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing point for airships (airships). Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced the enormous stress that the mast would put on the Empire State Building. To get around this problem, they put a frame in place around the frame of the entire building. Another obstacle encountered was security. First, the wind atop the Empire State Building was too strong for an airship to stay aloft without being shaken. Finally, the possibility of the airship bursting on peaks or exploding from hydrogen over New York. In conclusion, the Empire State Building's mast looked good on paper, but once you added some natural elements, the mast had too many flaws.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was the modification and reinforcement of the building frame. He indicates that "more than @ NUM1 thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the structure of the building" in order to accommodate the airships. However, after the changes, manufacturers faced another set of obstacles, more serious than before. the first was " security " : the destruction of the Hindenburg at @ LOCATION3 raised fears for a densely populated area like New York. Another obstacle was "nature"; the strong winds and violent drafts atop the Empire State Building made airships "neither practical nor safe". the third obstacle was “an existing law against airships flying low over urban areas”. this law made it "illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even to approach the area". the airships of Los Angeles and Columbia tried a few things, but were unsuccessful, and the idea of airships died out in the late 1930s. These are the obstacles that builders faced in trying to dock airships on The empire state building.

According to @ PERSON1's The Mooring Mast excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock at the top. The biggest obstacle that the builders faced was nature itself. @ PERSON1 said, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts," so he was not sure whether the airships were moored there. The wind would cause them to rotate around the mast, and it would be dangerous for builders to hang lead weights on airships as they would be suspended above pedestrians in the street. The other obstacle preventing airships from docking with the Empire State Building was due to the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas or towns. This existing law prohibited airships from mooring or approaching the building simply because the area was too low above the city. @ PERSON1 said: "Although two airships attempted to reach the building before the whole idea was given up." @ CAPS1 two airships failed to get close enough to secure or deliver the cargo to it safely, due to strong winds and the lack of some mooring equipment, which should have been installed. Due to the obstacles, the airships were never able to dock with the building.        

<START>

 

In "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles when they tried to dock airships. The idea for a mooring mast began when former New York Governor Al Smith was determined to make the Empire State Building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler building became the tallest Smith reportedly announced, "... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet" (Mooring Mast). While many were excited about the plan, there were plenty of obstacles before the airships docked there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand pound airship was tied to the building by a tether, then it "... would add stress to the building frame" (mast), which would have caused builders to completely change the structure of the building. Another reason was security. Back then, most foreign airships used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, in place of helium. Which could be a great danger considering all the people he could hurt below. However, the biggest obstacle to the future of airships was nature. Above the Empire State, there were wild wind currents that rotated the stern of the airship. When builders couldn't find a practical solution to all of these obstacles, it was realized that airships would not be kept there for the safety of everyone in New York City.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" written by @ PERSON1, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced that should have been evident before they built the mast. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." It is said in the " Mooring mast " that at the top of the building the winds were constantly moving due to strong air currents. Additionally, if the airships were attached, the rear of them would move while the airships would also be over the city with people watching. Dangerous for many. "An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." It is illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even to go into an area like this. These things should have been brought to the attention of builders with such obstacles as nature and violation of the law involved.         

<START>

 

Based on an excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Here are my three points to consider. They have to make plans which were very difficult and difficult. Airships and @ CAPS2 could crash into the building. It was too high at first. The builders needed to make long and difficult plans. They had to make the right skeleton for the mast to fit the rest of the building. They had to make changes to the existing plans to adapt the mooring mast. Second, airships and @ CAPS2 could cause an accident. Airships fly at about @ NUM1 miles per hour and they could approach the mast at too fast a speed and destroy it. Finally, the mast was very high. It would be difficult for airships to reach mast height. Irving Clavan said: "... Such a height made it desirable to defer to a later date for the landing gears." In @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The plans were difficult, the Blimps and @ CAPS2 could crash and the mast height was too high.              

<START>

 

Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were primarily weather and safety. In paragraph @ NUM1, the author says "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts". This means that due to the wind and drafts that always move airships, it would be difficult to control. Another obstacle they faced was security. Also in paragraph @ NUM1, the author says "Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted at the back with lead weights ... where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street. . "@ CAPS1 means having something swinging heavily over people is not a good idea. That would not be a good idea because if the weight were disconnected from the airships there is a possibility that someone will be seriously injured. These obstacles are the Empire State Building builders @ CAPS1 facing the mooring of airships.

Thraghat With the process of attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. The first obstacle the bilders encountered when attempting to allow the airships to dock there occurred in the actual " build " process. Because the wald mast adds a lot of stress to the building frame if it is simply attached to its flat roof, the buldas had to reconstruct the building's steel frame in order to safely place the mast on top, a project very expensive and time consuming. Another obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building concerned nature itself. Because the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving the stern of the ship, it circled around the mooring mast, which was very dangerous. Laws prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas also proved to be a hindrance as ships would never be able to actually approach the area. In conclusion, builders encountered many obstacles when building airships.        

<START>

 

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were. So it was an obstacle because if the workers were working up there with it, it should have been a very difficult and difficult situation to work on the building with it like that. Another obstacle I should say would be the wind pressure they had when the thousand foot airship was suspended only on a single cable which must have been a tough obstacle with the wind blowing hard. More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the framework of the buildings. job they had to do @ CAPS1 on the frame.

In the clip, Marcia Amidon Lüsted's Mooring Mast, readers learn that there are obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building are trying to allow airships to dock there. In paragraph @ NUM1, readers learn that architects are worried about the load of the airship and the pressure of the wind that is transmitted to the foundations of buildings. Architects should strengthen and modify the Empire State Building to get it used to this new situation. The architects also saw problems with foreign airships that use hydrogen rather than helium, as stated in paragraph @ NUM2, "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. " One of the biggest hurdles was the way the winds at the top of the building were still moving, so even if the airship was attached to the mast, the stern would still pivot. Later, the architects' idea of a mooring mast disappeared and it was then used for observation.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow airships there. Some of these obstacles had easy solutions, but some of them were really hard to solve. One of the obstacles they had was the airship at the top of the building held by a tether cable only, which would put stress on the structure of the building. In order to solve this problem, they had to make changes that would cost around six thousand dollars. This was not the only problem, there was a law which prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law prohibited approaching this area or even trying to attach to the building. In addition to this, the most difficult obstacle that architects faced was nature, and this problem was difficult to solve and also difficult to control. Finally make this dream come true.

When they built the Empire State Building, they encountered obstacles in building it. One obstacle they faced was that they wanted to make it as high and as secure as possible. The way the architects wanted to make it the tallest building in the world was to put a mooring mast on top of the building. A mooring mast is essentially a dock for airships (airships). It was dangerous. This was because the mast could break at such an altitude and land on the ground or break, and hang over the street. "... The government folks in Washington are considering a way to tie airships to this mast," said Al Smith, governor of New York for a four-year term. While it might sound pretty, it's not the safest idea.       

<START>

 

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. For one thing, builders couldn't just place a pole on top of the Empire State Building, because the building would surely collapse. "A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the Empire State Building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." To change and solve this problem, more than sixty thousand dollars would be needed for the modifications. Another obstacle that the builder did not see was the actual construction of a modern day airship. The airships, "used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." If the airships ever exploded while docking, the situation would have been horrendous in a densely populated area of New York City. Finally, the biggest obstacle in construction was nature itself. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot constantly." it would be very dangerous. The airship could @ CAPS1 above pedestrians on the streets, which meant it wasn't safe at all. There are three obstacles that prevented the Empire State Building from allowing airships to dock there.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, builders faced obstacles such as how the airships would stay attached to the mast. They didn't know how they would keep the airship from rotating because of the drafts. As stated in paragraph @ NUM1, "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building held by a single tether cable would add stress to the building frame."

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that "should have been apparent even before it was built. One of the problems they faced was that many airships" were using airship. hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This factor caused the building owners to worry about the safety of the many civilians who lived in downtown New York. Another factor that the builders face was that the winds "were constantly changing due to the drafts. 'violent air'. fields, airships could be ballasted with lead weights, but this could not be done at the Empire State Building ; many airships also could not reach the building due to the winds. One last factor he was faced with is that it is against the law for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This "law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even to approach the sea. area. ”All of these factors caused“ the idea of using the mooring mast for dredgers and passengers ”to disappear.

In the short story "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1 There is an obstacle that the builders had to overcome. Building the top of the Empire State Building was difficult because the dock part of the tower was not stable. In addition, the building frame could not support the airship, "the airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame." The designers designed a new tower that was a "shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within." The winches and control machines would be housed in the base of the tree itself. They also added an observation deck and more passengers were able to wait for the airship. another problem was that there was a law prohibiting planes from approaching urban areas. All in all, it was a difficult and painful design for them and cost a lot of money.

Despite Al Smith's goal of realizing the “dream of the pioneers of aviation,” the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow the airships to dock there. One of those issues that builders faced was the stress that an airship would add to the building itself; By mooring a large airship to the vessel with a single tether cable, the vessel should be able to withstand the stresses of the airship itself and the pressure of the wind that would be transmitted throughout the vessel. Thus, the builders were forced to reinforce the framework of the Empire State Building with more than @ MONEY1 of modifications. In addition, airships coming from outside the United States posed a danger because most of them were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. When the German airship was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the risks of such an accident became evident over a densely populated New York city. Not only that, but the raging winds atop the Empire State Building also posed a problem as even attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship continually swayed around the mooring mast; it turned out to be a danger to the citizens of New York directly below. In addition, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying at low altitude over urban areas; this made it illegal for an airship to attach to the Empire State Building and further compounded the inability of builders to attempt to allow airships to dock there.

In @ PERSON1's excerpt, "The Mooring Mast," the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Although airships were a modern form of transportation, they were very dangerous. As stated in paragraph @ NUM1, "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen was highly flammable." This, along with "strong drafts" as noted in paragraph @ NUM2, were two of the risks that builders had to consider. The builders were to discuss the idea of a safe means by which the airships could moor there while ensuring that no one was injured. Another obstacle that manufacturers had to consider was the law passed which was "against airships flying low over urban areas", as explained in paragraph @ NUM3. The excerpt clearly explains the complications that builders had to endure and take into account when constructing the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" by @ PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. The biggest obstacle that the builders had to overcome was that the winds were constantly changing due to the drafts. Another reason the airships weren't allowed to dock at the Empire State Building was that many airships outside of @ LOCATION3 used hydrogen which is highly flammable. So if any of them exploded like in Lakehurst, it would affect more people in New Jersey. Another reason airships weren't allowed to dock there was because they could use lead weights to make the rear of the airship heavier, as it would be dangerous for people underneath. Another reason airships weren't allowed is because of the sharp arrows from other buildings in the neighborhood. If a sea captain was afraid to blow up his airship, then no one should be allowed. The last reason was that there was a law saying that hovercraft cannot fly too low over urban areas. The ones with the hurdles that builders could never overcome.

Builders face many obstacles when creating the Empire State Building. First of all, the height of the building is all the more questioned and there has been a lot of discussion about the top of the building. The primary purpose of the empire state buildings was to be the future of the city they wanted to feed people on airship. another issue is where is the real way to get the airship stable enough to stick to the building and the big planes aren't supposed to come back close to the building because other buildings are around. In conclusion, they faced many problems.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. One of the biggest being security. As noted in paragraph @ NUM1, most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. Another problem was also mentioned in paragraph @ NUM2, it was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts. Even if the airship was attached, the stern of the ship would pivot around the morning mass. Yet another hurdle as to why airships couldn't dock at the Empire State Building was in paragraph @ NUM3, this was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. . These obstacles made it nearly impossible for the Empire State Building to fulfill its original purpose.

There were many hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to contend with in trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the reasons is that the airships weren't safe. This is because airships coming from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. If the airship caught fire in a densely populated area, many people could die. Another obstacle that builders faced was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving, so the back of the airship swiveled back and forth. They could only solve the problem by putting weights on the back of the ship, but doing so was impractical and dangerous. This is because the weights are hanging over pedestrians, so if one of them breaks it could kill someone. The third hurdle is that there was a law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for ships to tie up to the building. The last hurdle was that the wind could have pushed the ship on sharp arrows, which could puncture the ship, so the pilots could not get the mooring equipment. These are the obstacles that builders face, which has prevented the installation of mooring equipment.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. Security reasons, weather conditions and government laws made the mooring mast aim at the top of the building fail. For example, many airships used at the time contained hydrogen instead of helium, "hydrogen is highly flammable ... over a densely populated area". (@ NUM1). The builders realized that was not smart. In addition, "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts." (@ NUM2) This created a dangerous situation as the ship was swinging around the mast. Finally, the most obvious obstacle was a government law prohibiting even a ship from approaching the vessel. “… an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” (@ NUM3) The whole idea that was built for something big had slowly waned. The builders of the Empire State Building faced these obstacles, and many others, in their attempt to allow airships to dock there.

In the article "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many obstacles to the construction of the Empire State Building as a docking station for airships are described. John Tauranac, the man who proposed the plan to dock the airships atop the Empire State Building, forgot some very important things to consider. First of all, the whole building should be modified because "A thousand-foot airship moored at the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add constraints to the structure of the building" (paragraph @ NUM1). The second problem to be solved would be the security of the city. Many "airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." (paragraph @ NUM2.). If an accident like the German airship Hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse. Finally, the “violent drafts” (paragraph @ NUM3) would arise as one of the biggest obstacles. The US Navy airship Los Angeles attempted to dock but was unable to get close enough because of the "strong wind". (paragraph @ NUM4). Obstacles associated with transforming the Empire State Building into a mooring mast caused too many obstacles that could not be resolved.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Allowing airships to dock atop a building had never been done before. They had to add over sixty thousand dollars worth of framing before they could even start building the mast. Then, after the mast was designed and the building framed up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be finished before the mast could begin to be framed.

Builders had many problems allowing airships to dock with the Empire State Building. First in @ CAPS1 @ NUM1, the author explains that "a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would only add stress to the building frame." . Builders with this would have to build the building to make it more stable. There were also instances where, outside of the United States, they used hydrogen other than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable, and because New York is so populated, it would not be safe for podestrios. Seeing this, you can tell that the builders had a lot of problems coming from something so "easy".     

<START>

 

The obstacles to docking the airships to the Empire State Building were far too great, which should have been obvious before construction began. A major reason, security. Most airships used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, and after the "Hindenburg" accident at Lakehurst, the idea was rejected. Another reason it just didn't work was the wind blowing atop the Empire State Building. The winds would have been too strong for the airships to dock safely with the Empire State. There was already a law on airships flying too low over urban areas. With an airship approaching the building would make it illegal. Thus ending the idea of proceeding.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. In paragraph @ NUM1, the excerpt tells the reader about a huge problem. He says: "A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of a building, held together by a single tether, would add stress to the structure of the building." For this reason, more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the framework of the buildings. Another step back can be found in paragraph @ NUM2. He says, "The biggest obstacle ... was nature itself." Due to the strong draft, the stern of the vessel would pivot around the mooring mast. Tying up the mooring mast would not help much. Lead weights could not be used. In paragraph @ NUM2, it is stated that " weights hanging well above pedestrians ... were neither practical nor safe ". All these obstacles showed the architects that the project at that time was impossible.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. In the excerpt, it says that "the Empire State Building's mooring mast was doomed." One obstacle that was somewhat invisible was the fact that "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium," which is a much more unstable gas and if an airship catches fire and falls to the ground. over New York, many civilians would be killed or injured. Another obstacle that the builders faced was "the winds at the top of the building were constantly turning." This would make it very difficult to anchor an airship to the mast, and as the excerpt says, they couldn't use lead weights suspended under the airship as they would be suspended above the citizens below. These are the problems facing the builders of the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. These obstacles were not easy to overcome. First, the Empire State Building's steel frame had to be altered and reinforced to accommodate the “new situation”. Another obstacle was security. Having an accident would be detrimental to the lives of many people because it is located in such a densely populated area. In addition, the winds made it very dangerous.

There were a lot of issues that Empire State Building engineers faced when they wanted to dock airships. Well, for a start the winds this high were too strong, as it says in paragraph @ NUM1 "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts". There were also the airships themselves which were a problem because they were filled with hydrogen, which is very flammable. Another problem was that air laws stipulated that airships, in urban areas, should not fly too low. It was because of these issues that destroyed Al Smith's idea that the construction could dock airships.

With any mass transit unit, many challengers are expected and some are impossible to solve. According to the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships, or airships, to dock there. Regarding the mooring of these airships, they violated "an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas". Which made the builders' procedure illegal. Also, not only was it a danger to the citizens of New York, but due to the weather conditions, it was dangerous for the passengers and workers of the airship. Lüsted states that "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong drafts." This shows that any project should be checked at all times for safety precautions.

Al Smith's dream of having airships moored atop the Empire @ CAPS1 building was interrupted by a bitter reality. The idea partially failed due to the inability to dock a @ DATE2 balloon filled with flammable gas to a building in the city. The sheer size of this preview was astounding, and it created a lot of problems. First, the wind at the top of a skyscraper is large and inconsistent. It is extremely difficult to tie up to a building seen when the Los Angeles attempted to tie up at @ DATE1. The balloon was unable to dock due to the potential damage it could cause to itself and the surrounding city. Airships were also kept afloat by hydrogen which, due to its chemical nature, is extremely flammable. Airships had exploded in the past like the Hindenburg. Engineers knew that if a similar accident happened at the Empire State Building, substantial damage would have been done to the city and to the building itself. These drawbacks combined with the use of planes rather than airships ensured that no airship would ever be docked at the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow the airships to dock on the mooring mast. One of them being that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen to float, which made them very flammable and dangerous. If an airship were damaged over New York City, many people could be injured. In addition, nature itself made mooring extremely difficult. The winds made the airships very unstable. If one were strapped to the mast, the winds could wrap the line around the mast. Another obstacle was the existing law which prohibited aircraft from flying this low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any vessel to approach the mast.

Al Smith and his team of builders faced several obstacles while trying to get the airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. The first problem with mooring airships is that the steel frame and foundation could not withstand the stress imposed by an airship attached to it. Additionally, when builders looked at past accidents with airships like the Hindenburg, they realized that if an accident were to occur, many lives would be at stake. Additionally, there were laws that limited the The height at which an airship could fly over urban areas, so it would be illegal for an airship to dock with the Empire State Building because it would be too low. Finally, and according to the builders, the biggest problem with docking airships to the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the building were very strong and changed unpredictably, effectively turning the moored airship into an impending disaster.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock, including not being able to put a mooring mast on top of the building for fear that, because the airship was held by a "single cable", it " would add stress to the framework of buildings ". @ CAPS1 with the amount of the airship @ PERSON1 and the wind the frame of the buildings would not be strong enough and should be "modified and strengthened". Another obstacle to attempting to moor airships was the wind. The building was high @ CAPS1, the wind currents were volatile and “constantly moving” as a result the stern of the airships would “rotate around and around the mooring mast”. @ CAPS2 obstacle encountered by the builders was that they were trying to build the mooring mast in an urban area with other buildings, nearby the airship could be punctured and would also be dangerous for pedestrians in the city.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple challenges in their idea of the building's use. The first problem for builders came about the framing of the building. A thousand-foot airship at the top of the building held by a single cable would put a lot of stress on the building's framing. the load of the airship and the wind must have reached the foundations of the buildings, which were far too far below. The building would have to be altered, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars to alter. The architects made modifications to the building to meet these needs. But again, the architects gave us a problem. The mast of the building would pose problems that should have been spotted by the architects before construction. the biggest problem having to do with security issues. the most airship outside the country used highly flammable hydrogen. There had already been an explosion in New York, it could be too much.         

<START>

 

In order for the airships to dock on the roof of the Empire State Building, workers had to complete a series of tasks such as reinforcing the steel frame and designing a strong mast. If the frame weren't strong enough, the building would simply collapse. Over sixty thousand dollars have been spent to restructure the framework. Also, with high speed winds the mast would have been incredibly strong, otherwise the airship wouldn't stay in one place. After the Hindenburg disaster, people realized how dangerous these airships were, and the idea was therefore deemed not only dangerous but illegal. In conclusion, not a single airship would ever be docked, and none would ever be.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock. First, the thousand-foot airship would attach to buildings with a single cable, adding stress to the building's framing. The builders were forced to change and strengthen the foundations to solve the problem of stability. Likewise, the builders had to deal with the problem of the pressure of the wind which was constantly moving at heights of more than @ NUM1 feet in the air. The load of the airship swaying in the breeze would transmit pressure and strain onto the foundations of the buildings. This was a high safety issue and central to the decision that airships could not dock at the Empire State Building. Finally, builders were forced to face the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for airships to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders faced significant hurdles such as weak buildings, security, and law enforcement, which made any attempt to dock the airships to the Empire State's mooring mast nearly impossible. .

In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. Al Smith wanted to add a "top" or "hat" to the Empire State Building that would serve as a docking station for the airships. The dream was not going to come true. The first of many problems was to install the mooring mast, the docking station, at the top of the building. "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." An airship would only be held by a cable. Airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted throughout the building. There were also security concerns. Many airships used hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. It is also very windy around the Empire State Building. The airships had to hang sandbags by ropes. These would be hung over the people below. The mooring mast was a good idea, but the builders faced a lot of issues. The project was never completed.

While in theory the idea of the mooring mast seemed feasible, in reality there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. A first problem was encountered during the process of adding the mooring mast to the building. As stated in the article : “ Architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast above the flat roof of the Empire State Building. … The steel frame… should be modified and reinforced to adapt to the new situation. " This change, to overcome the obstacle of attaching the mooring mast, consumed over @ NUM1 thousand dollars and a lot of time and effort. A second obstacle which greatly interfered with safety was "nature itself". High winds at the top of the building would cause the captive airships to rotate around and around the mooring mast. Airships moored in airfields could be ballasted with lead weights, but this idea could not be carried out because "... use them at the Empire State Building, where they would be suspended over pedestrians in the street was neither practical nor safe ”. Such problems created many obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building.

In this clip, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. Some of these issues included weather conditions, height, and the gases used to power the airship. Time was a force hard to beat. If the airships docked at the building, the wind at that height was more violent and could deflect the airship. The next contributing factor was size. In the snippet, he said the law ordered a limit. If airships were too low for urban areas, that would be dangerous. At any time, something could knock the airship down and crash into buildings and pedestrians. The last hurdle is the type of gas used. Apparently, hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. This could also cause damage to passengers. In conclusion, weather conditions, height, and the type of gas used were among the many obstacles the Empire State Building would face when allowing airships to dock there.

The architects of the Empire State Building believed that airships could dock on the building if there was a mooring mast. However, there were many hurdles to overcome in order for this to happen. If an airship landed on the mast, it would put a lot of pressure on the building by swaying in the wind. "A thousand foot airship moored ... would add stress to the framing of buildings." And since nature played a role, the wind could tip the body of the airship over, eventually causing the building's frame to rupture and the building to collapse. Another obstacle that architects faced was danger. American airships used helium, while airships in other countries used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. "... the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey ..." Architects realized that the Hindenburg explosion would have been worse if it had happened on the Empire State Building ". .. over a densely populated area. .. ".

In the clip "The Mooring @ CAPS1" by Marcia Amidon, there were a lot of issues trying to add an airship dock to the top.

Another obstacle was nature itself, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts." (@ NUM2). The last problem was the existing law against airships flying too low over cities or urban areas. "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area."

Through the excerpt The Mooring Mast from @ ORGANIZATION2, we learned that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while attempting to allow airships to dock at the top of the building. Some of the obstacles that manufacturers have faced in this engineering challenge are ; @ CAPS1 the builders took up the challenge of knowing how the Empire State Building was going to be able to support the weight of these long planes. We learned this in paragraph @ NUM1 when the author states "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building ... would add stress to the building frame." To overcome this problem “ The steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced (@ NUM2). " He later said that these changes would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Another issue that builders faced was the safety of mooring an airship in a heavily populated area. In paragraph @ NUM3, we learned that most airships are made of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. After "the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey ... The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place overhead.

The builders of the Empire State Building could not dock the airships because of the building's structure, the winds pushing the airships, and public safety. The structure could not withstand the sway of the airship due to the winds pushing the stern.

In the excerpt The Mooring Mast from Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1 explained why there is a landing zone on the Empire State Building called Mooring Mast. The first hurdle workers faced was that there was no landing space atop the Empire State Building. This means the airships could @ CAPS4 at all. To solve the problem of not having a landing zone, they would add the mooring mast. The mooring mast was built with girls holding the airships but that would put too much pressure on the building. The workers used a silver @ CAPS2 to construct the building so that it was not stressed when the airships were held at the mooring mast. After everything was sorted out, they forgot one thing, the wind. The wind was so strong that the airship could not maneuver. to climb to the top of the Empire State Building. When the workers understood this, they gave up. Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1 explained what the workers tried to do to get an airship to @ CAPS4 on the Empire State Building in the clip The Mooring Mast.

Most of the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building were due to inclement weather. If New York ever had a windy day, the airship would pull the mast. The mast is attached to the "@ CAPS1" of the building, and this can affect the frames or "@ CAPS1" of the building. Another reason is the danger this would pose to all of New York. If an airship hit something or something went wrong, the airship would be @ CAPS3 over New York. With all the traffic in New York City, you probably wouldn't want a burning airship falling over your head.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. Builders couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the roof.

If an airship had caught fire and exploded over downtown New York City, legal action would have been created. Another problem that the builders encountered when attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building were the winds at the top of the building. There were changing winds due to strong air currents and these winds made it extremely difficult to dock the airships.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few hurdles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. A problem with the height and altitude of the Zeppelin. Even if they did dock, the back of it would move around in the wind. Another reason was that on May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg was reduced to ashes after takeoff. which means it was highly flammable due to the use of hydrogen instead of helium.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The airships were long; some were up to a thousand feet tall. The airships were moored by an electric winch, which pulled a line from front to back. The architects could not put a mooring mast at the top of the building. A thousand foot airship held by a single winch would be too heavy for the frame of the building. In order for it to work, it would have to be beefed up to accommodate the thousand-foot airships. It would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars just for the executive. Another obstacle was security. Airships from the United States contained helium, which means it was highly flammable. If an accident were to happen like in Lakehurst, New Jersey, many more people would be injured given that downtown New York was densely populated. Other obstacles were set up for the builders of the Empire State building which proves that it was not a good idea to dock the airships.

Manufacturers encountered many obstacles when attempting to allow airships to dock. One of them was that they had discovered that it would not make the building unstable. "A thousand foot airship moored at the top of the building ... would add stress to the frame of the building." Another obstacle was that the winds would be too strong and unsafe for the airship to be up there "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts". A third example would be that it was too dangerous to have the airship up there because the gases inside were extremely flammable "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen ... and l hydrogen is highly flammable ". The final hurdles that builders would face was that there is a law that prohibits airships from approaching the ground in urban areas. So in conclusion, we can see that while it was a good idea to port side airship, it was not practical.

In this excerpt, "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow airships to dock there. The first problem they encountered was redesigning the building's original skeleton to meet the needs of the mooring mast. This can be shown when the excerpt states that "over sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the buildings" (paragraph @ NUM1). Workers had to modify their first design to meet the mandatory requirements of the mooring mast. Workers also had to contend with the fact that overall the mooring mast was too dangerous to use. This can be proven when the snippet says : " The biggest reason was safety ... hydrogen is highly flammable " (paragraph @ NUM2). Airships used outside the United States used gas and created a dangerous risk of accident. Another battle that the builders had to face was the strong winds. This can be shown when the excerpt quotes : "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself" (paragraph @ NUM3). The winds caused the airship to move too much, making it unsafe to use. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles as they attempted to allow the airships to dock there.

There were many different hurdles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to license airships. For example, "the wind at the top of the building was constantly changing due to the strong air currents. Due to the weather itself, it prevented them from building the mooring mast. Another reason is" to use the building of the empire state where they would hang over pedestrians in the street was neither practical nor safe. "This could easily kill people who were wandering. Finally, they could not over to the Empire State Building because" It was an existing law banning airships flying too low over urban areas.

When constructing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced several obstacles. The biggest obstacle was @ CAPS1 Nature. Winds at this height move frequently, causing the airship to overturn around the mast, making boarding dangerous. Another obstacle was the way they weighed down airships with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky as they could strike people below. The third obstacle was a law prohibiting airships flying too low in urban areas. This prevented any airship from docking or even approaching the Empire State Building. These obstacles forced the builders to shelve the construction of the mooring mast.       

<START>

 

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were as follows. They needed a precise way to make everything perfect for the job. The whole process of building this job was very complicated and required the best expertise. In paragraph @ NUM1, the quote from Al Smith greatly confirms my point of view. He says "a group of engineers here in New York are trying to come up with a workable and workable arrangement and the government people in Washington are looking for a safe way to tie the airships to the mast." This indicates how hard people are working on this job. In conclusion, it was a complicated job. They weren't positive if the mast could even stay. They were also not positive if the fluids inside were just a problem factor.

In the play "The Mooring MAst", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, he describes what the Empire State Building's mast really was for. Manufacturers faced many obstacles while attempting to allow airships to @ CAPS1 on the mast. One of the issues they faced was that the airship landing on the roof was adding stress to the building's framing. Wind stress and pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This means that the building would have to be modified and reinforced. Safety was also a big issue for the mast. Because airships used hydrogen, it could catch fire and be destroyed in a densely populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. This caused the stern of the ship to rotate. Lastley, it did not work, it was because of the law prohibiting airships flying too low. Before the builders built all of this in addition to the building, they should have thought about all the flaws that it could have.

Al Smith was a very competitive person : one of the @ CAPS1 Al had to go through was competing with another building and he had to make his building taller than the Chrysler building. Who in @ DATE1 if he hadn't made his building taller he would have lost the title of tallest building in New York

While the idea of turning the mast on top of the Empire State Building into a mooring area for airships was a very smart idea, it wasn't very safe at all. One of the "reasons airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas. This law left the idea of the mast as a failure before even the start of construction, but the workers did not notice this law. Another obstacle which added to the difficulty of the construction was the pressure exerted by the airships moored to the building on the base of the building. This resulted in a Another expense of @ MONEY1 trying to solve this problem. A third factor that made the idea of defining mast climbing even more difficult came directly from nature itself. Winds that rise above the ground made it very difficult to maneuver the airship in such a small space. mooring mast but could not get close enough to moor due to high winds.

There are a lot of things in life that seem like brilliant ideas, but in reality there are a lot of flaws. One such idea is to use the Empire State Building as a mooring mast for airships. This is what Al Smith, then governor of New York, discovered in an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face serious obstacles to allow the mooring of airships: @ CAPS1 building the Empire State Building, many blueprints had to be modified. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they had to dock. The skeleton they had put in place was putting too much pressure on the top half of the building for it to shatter. Another thing the builders had to contend with was the safety of the @ LOCATION1. If the highly flammable helium was inside airships, it would endanger the lives of thousands of people. Finally, the builders had to face strong winds. It also put emphasis on the frame of the building as the winds were so strong there and also the fear that it would blow the airship into the pointed mast and break the airship. All in all, there are many reasons why the mooring mast never became a reality.           

<START>

 

The idea of mooring the airships atop the Empire State Building was grandiose. It seems that the dream of airship transport is on the rise, however, the architects were blinded by their enthusiasm. The competitive nature of Al @ CAPS1 has not only pushed the building to an unprecedented height of 1,250 feet, but also combined transport in a new, fashionable and efficient way. It not only got the public and the architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith didn't see all the obstacles ahead that would end his airship plans. One of the hurdles being that the sway of the airship would add stress to the structure of the building, although the necessary precautions had been taken, the hurdle foreshadowed others to come. When the Hindenburg airship was destroyed by fire due to hydrogen gas, people became skeptical. What if it exploded over a crowded New York street ? In addition, an existing law against planes flying too low over urban areas prohibited airship plans. The obstacles turned out to be too great for the plan to pass. Although plans were simply postponed until the late 1930s, the idea of airships atop the Empire State Building was gone.

According to the excerpt "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles while trying to allow the airship to dock there. The builders of the Empire State Building failed to realize that building the mast would create too many problems and safety risks. Without thinking about the obstacles, the mooring mast also had a problem on its own anyway. According to the excerpt, one of its biggest obstacles was " the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts ." This posed a problem because the airship could go anywhere, not land properly in the mast and cause damage. This problem also comes with risks for pedestrians on the street. The airships "... could be ballasted at the rear with lead weights" because they used open airstrips. It was not a good idea to use them in the Empire State Building. Another thing the builders should have considered was that there was already a law in place that is "... against airships flying too low over urban areas". Overall, there were a lot of things the builders should have considered before trying to allow the airship to dock there.

According to the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the main issues was that architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. Modifications had to be made in order for an airship to land there safely. The biggest obstacle was nature. Lüsted put it best in the @ NUM1 paragraph, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong currents. Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around it. The mooring mast. The last problem the builders faced was that, even if they managed to find a way to put the mooring mast in place, there was still a law stating that illegal airships would land there. Lüsted said in paragraph @ NUM2, “This law makes it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the building or even approach the area ...” Obviously, from the examples given, the builders of the The Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there.    

<START>

 

The obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building were meteorological. Nature itself would ruin the construction delay. The winds would turn, even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast. Another challenge that builders faced was that airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.  

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in attempting to allow airships to dock with the mooring at the top of the building. The main challenge was caused by nature itself. The winds above the building were constantly blowing and changing direction. This would cause any airship attempting to dock to sway in the wind, posing a number of safety risks for passengers getting on and off the zepplen. The airship could also pierce its chassis on neighboring buildings when attempting to dock, which also poses risks to the safety of people on the building and on the ground. Having a zepplen attached to the building also made it structurally unstable and modifications had to be made to the building's frame to give it more support. Eventually the idea was dropped because it would never work and was unrealistic.      

<START>

 

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building clashed while trying to dock airships. One obstacle was nature. At the top of the building, the winds constantly changing because of violent drafts. It would turn a ship dangerously. Even if he was strapped behind his back, he would move. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents. Even though the airships were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship had a swivel." Another obstacle was security. Foreign ships use hydrogen and extremely flammable gases. In the fields, they use lead weights for ballast. If an accident happened with either one, it would be extremely fatal. A flaming airship or metal object falling from extreme heights would cause serious injury as the landing is over a densely populated city. "Airships outside @ LOCATION1 use hydrogen ... is highly flammable." "Can be weighed down with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street." A law prohibited ships from flying in low-lying urban areas, so if the moore worked, it couldn't be used. These events led to the quiet demise of thought in the late 1930s.

Along the way, the builders faced numerous obstacles while attempting to allow the airships to dock with the Empire State Building. Al Smith came up with the idea of making airships a new form of transportation. The idea sounded good with airships moving at a speed of seventy-five miles per hour and moving for thousands of feet without needing to be pushed back. Anxious, Al Smith wasn't sure when it would all be over, saying, "It's level, okay. No kidding. We're working on it now." It would simply not be possible for the architect to lay the enormous mooring mass above the flat roofs of the buildings. Another problem would be strong wind currents. The blimp's fate had vanished. Airplanes have become more suited to passengers than to airships.

Based on the snippet I just read, here are some of the obstacles that @ ORGANIZATION1 one of the obstacles was the ball because he had hell and it was also a flame.

There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The first problem they encountered was that they had to change and repair the building's @ CAPS1 in order to compensate for all the stress that would be on the building when the airships land. After building and constructing the bearing, there were several other issues. The first problem was that the hydrogen in balloons is very flammable. This is a problem because New York is densely populated and with a flammable substance overhead it poses a threat. The second problem was the airship itself. It can easily blow in the wind, and would constantly ripple in the wind, and unlike a field, the cold weights are not tied up in the back because of the crowd below. The third and final issue they addressed was the law: airships are not allowed to fly too low over urban areas. The Empire State Building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it. Several of these issues led to the failure of the original idea and left the Empire State Building with a tall pole of no use.

Airships, also known today as airships, docked at the Empire State Building. The Empire State Building was used as a mooring point for airships (which are huge steel balloons filled with hydrogen and helium, which made them lighter than air). They had a top speed of @ NUM1 mph for thousands of miles. "Al Smith saw an opportunity for the Empire State Building: a moor added to the top of the building would allow airships to anchor for several hours for refueling or service, and allow passengers to get on and off." As stated in the excerpt. The airships were moored by an electric winch which kept the large balloon from going anywhere and tied it to the mast. Al Smith succeeded in building Moore because it was good for airships.

Some of the hurdles the Empire State Building builders faced when attempting to allow airships to dock there was that it would not be able to attach the tether cable, as it adds strain. to the frame of the building. Also in the story, they tell you how the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be altered and reinforced to accommodate the new situation. 

<START>

 

In "The Mooring Mast", many builders encountered obstacles in attempting to dock airships to the Empire State Building. Most of the reasons were related to security. While the idea of mooring airships to the building sounds good, a lot could have gone wrong. The Empire State Building was a huge structure for the time, although it seemed ideal for the mast to go on "winds" would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to fly the airships. Additionally, most airships from other countries such as @ LOCATION2 used “ hydrogen ” in their airships. Although airships were "hailed" as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken due to the densely populated area of New York City. For airships at the time, it was a good transportation idea, but even though the Empire State Building's structure looked good, they still had to be careful of the building and the people below, and for German airships filled with hydrogen were not a safe condition for a populated city.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced several hurdles in their attempts to allow airships to dock there. One being the changes in the wind flow. Airships had steering systems and could be tethered, but the wind could dominate those systems causing them to lose control and crash. Another obstacle was the fear of another "Hindenburg" accident. On May 6, 1937, the Hinden Burg (an airship) which, like all other airships, contained hydrogen (a highly flammable gas) was set on fire and set alight, killing mainly the men and women on board, however , if this incident occurred above the densely populated @ CAPS1.YC, the number of fatalities would increase due to pedestrians below.

Some obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock with it are safety and nature. Safety was an obstacle because most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium and because hydrogen is flammable it was not at all safe as it would have could catch fire just as the "Hindenburg caught fire in 1937, so the owners of the Empire State Building saw how dangerous it was to the public and the building. Nature is another obstacle because the wind currents on top of the building continued to move due to strong drafts.These are just a few of the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building.

While great expectations were set for the Empire State Building, builders encountered many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there, as explained in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1. The dream of having a mooring mast to moor new airships was quickly interrupted when architects first discovered the stress that an airship, held by a single tether cable, would add to the building's fame. . As a result, “ the stress of the airship load and wind pressure would be ... Therefore, the architects had to strengthen the frame of the buildings to accommodate the enormous stresses. Second, the owners of the Empire State Building found that an airship law was also becoming a hindrance. Stating that airships could not fly too low over populated urban areas, the law became another practical reason why airships could not dock atop the miraculous building. Finally, the architects had also discovered that the biggest obstacle to their success was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building have been described as violent, powerful and unpredictable. Consequently, the mooring of airships to the mast " where they would be suspended above pedestrians in the street, was neither practical nor safe " (paragraph @ NUM2). In addition, the strong winds made it difficult to approach the mooring mast for airships. In December 1930, the captain of the US Navy airship "Los Angeles" feared that "the wind would blow the airship into the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area, which would pierce the hull of the airship" (paragraph @ NUM3 ). Indeed, the idea of using the mooring mast to moor airships to the top of the Empire State Building has quietly disappeared. As described by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1 in the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles to allow airships to dock there.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's excerpt, The Mooring Mast, talks about the Empire State that was built to be the tallest building. There are many ways for builders to attempt to allow airships to dock there. In the excerpt, it says: " Most airships used hydrogen rather than helium (hydrogen is more flammable) ". This @ CAPS1 proves how likely he is to destroy the entire Imperial State with fire. Another @ CAPS1 who describes how builders tried to allow airships to dock there when it says, "Hanging over pedestrians on the street was neither convenient nor safe". This @ CAPS1 @ CAPS4 the safety of people walking on the @ CAPS5 and if they are injured. finally another @ CAPS1 which portrays the obstacles that builders have faced when it says "... blow the airship on the sharp arrows of other buildings".

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's non-fiction article The Mooring Mast, he provides information on potential mast issues. In @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 it says "The steel frame of the Empire State Building should be changed and strengthened." This shows that at the beginning the building was not strong enough to support such a weight. Another problem was nature. The workers had to put nature into practice. If they had an airship or an airship up there, the wind could potentially damage the airship. There was also a law in place that prohibited planes from offering to fly that low. Finally, workers had to make the height exceed any other higher height. In @ CAPS1 @ NUM2 says "On December 11, 1929 he announced that the Empire ... would reach 1250 feet ..." John Tauranac also followed up saying "Their summit, they believe, would serve a higher calling. " The builders had a lot to consider, as they had issues with height, frame and law. That they had to settle.

In the novel The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State Building funeral attempted to allow airships to dock, there were engineering issues. One problem with the mooring was that the building was finished before the idea came to mind. A second problem was that the entire skeletal structure had to be altered in order for the airships to dock. Then the question of how the airships, airships, would stay next to the building. It was a more difficult problem after it was illegal to have airships near buildings as well. In addition, if they do crash, they are flammable and can kill people. These are a few facts that made it difficult for the Empire State Building to construct an airship dock in Marcia Amidon Lüsted's novel The Mooring Mast.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, there is an obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. This idea wouldn't work because the airships are way too heavy, which would put more pressure on the Empire State Building. When there was massive pressure on the building, it collapsed. “ The load of the airship and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, located about eleven hundred feet below. " Another obstacle is that it is expensive to build. "Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame." In New York there are a lot of places and the people are crowded. There is not enough space for the dock. "Some were up to a thousand feet long, the same length as four city blocks in New York City." These are the main obstacles for the Empire State Building to allow airships to dock.

According to the extract "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while trying to let the airships dock there. One obstacle they faced was that the frame of the building would have to be changed. Indeed, the airship added stress to the structure of the building when it was moored on it. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle encountered by manufacturers was that it would be too difficult to keep airships stationary. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." This made it unsafe for passengers as well as pedestrians on the street and prevented the airship from getting close enough to dock. A third hurdle that builders faced was that there was a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas because it was very dangerous. Although it seemed like a good idea, there were too many obstacles and dangers in letting the airships dock at the Empire State Building.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the most apparent problems was its urban area with a lot of pedestrians walking on the street. They didn't want airships to fly so close without knowing what might happen. Another thing was that the German airship had been destroyed by fire. They must have thought how much worse it could have been if it was on the mooring mast, possibly killing people and destroying the building completely. Also how much more construction and money it would take for the Empire State Building to hold an airship. There were a lot of issues that they hadn't thought of in the process, which is why the mooring mast did not work out as expected.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there.

In paragraph @ NUM2 it says that "if the airship was attached to the mooring mast the stern of the ship would pivot", now this is neither practical nor safe. If the vessel is moored, the back should be stable. The last hurdle that manufacturers faced was a law banning airships that fly too low.

When the idea of making a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was considered, the builders failed to realize the obstacles that should be cleared. One of the obstacles was "nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong air currents." This means that if an airship were moored for loading and unloading, it could move freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of the dangerous winds would be in 1930, the " US Navy airship Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to moor because of the high winds." States have used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If something bad happened, it could have big consequences for @ LOCATION2's densely populated downtown. A third and final hurdle that occurred was "an existing law against airships flying too weak over urban areas." This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area.

Another obstacle was nature, due to the winds atop the Empire State Building it was difficult to get the airships closer to the mast. Another obstacle that the mast builders faced was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City. All in all, the idea could not be projected in an actual visual interpretation due to the obstacles faced by the mast builders, now people have planes and airports to dock planes - there is no use for the mast above the Empire State Building regarding aviation.

In constructing the airship docks on the Empire State Building, the builders faced a myriad of issues that should have been easy to understand. Everyone got caught in the hype in my opinion. Other airships outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. After the Hindenburg disaster, "... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area like the city center. from New York". The winds also played a role in the construction. "... the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." The airships would not be able to dock and stay there due to the strong drafts. There was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low in urban areas. " The law would make it illegal for an airship to dock with the building or even approach the area ... ". Finally, times have changed and airplanes have become the new mode of air travel, ending airships operated as the main supplier.

The builders encountered quite a few problems when they attempted to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph @ NUM1 "Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium ; and hydrogen is highly flammable." This would mean that if a moored airship filled with hydrogen caught fire, it would burn down the Empire State Building and much of the city, killing scores of people with its explosion. Another main obstacle As stated in paragraph @ NUM2 was the nature "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts". These winds would make it nearly impossible for an airship to reach the mast and dock. In addition, the airship would sway violently when attached to the mast. to the building or even approach the area. " With the law in force, no one would even want to try. These are the three major problems encountered when constructing the mast

The builders of the Empire State Building faced tough obstacles in ... " accommodating the passengers, " new roads, and the greatest obstacle was nature itself. By welcoming the passengers, they had to bring them on the existing transatlantic routes. It was because the new roads were not yet made. The reasoning being because the building had to be bigger. So they added more stuff on top of it. They wanted the State Building to be nature itself because the @ CAPS1 building moved away from "strong drafts". In addition, the airship was more open to the fields of the moor. The state building was also weighed down by the lead weights.         

<START>

 

There are a few hurdles the builders faced when attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the fiercely changing wind currents at the height of the mooring to be placed. This would move the airship and possibly send it to another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. The airship after docking the airship would put a lot of stress on the building itself. This would disrupt the frame and could affect the building as a whole. Additionally, most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable as we saw during the Hindenburg disaster. For all these reasons, the mooring mast has never seen an airship docked.       

<START>

 

According to the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, engineers merged several obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock in the State Building @ CAPS1. As noted in paragraph number nine, the @ CAPS2 problem was "airship load stress". With all of this weight being transferred to the foundation of the buildings, the Empire State Building's steel frame would have to be altered and reinforced to accommodate its new situation. It was very expensive to do. Sixty thousand dollars were needed. Another problem was that airships did not stay still when docked. The winds knocked them down. One solution was to put weights at the back of the airstrips, but the weights "would be suspended over pedestrians in the street" as explained in paragraph @ NUM1.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced several obstacles in their attempts to dock the airships there. The builders first had to make sure that the building was going to be able to support the airship. Once they were done, some security related issues arose. It was very dangerous because some air balloons were made from flammable hydrogen. If there were any problems, the people of New York could be in grave danger. The wind was also a problem ... because it was so devious that an airship would be heavy in the back. Swinging over New York was very dangerous. The latest complications that affected the idea of dribbling docking were "an existing law against airships flying too low over the urban area". Due to legal, safety, and nature complications, the builders never succeeded in achieving their goal of allowing airships to dock with the Empire State Building.

In the clip, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, encountered many obstacles in the construction of the Empire State Building while allowing airships to dock there. The author states that "The other practical reason airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." This law was considered illegal for a ship to approach the area and attach itself to the vessel. Another obstacle was the lack of a landing zone, it was a challenge to expand into New York, which made it difficult for airships to land. The biggest obstacle was nature itself, time rotated airships around the mooring mast. The author states that " airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted at the rear with lead weights ... suspended over pedestrians in the street, were neither practical nor safe ".

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many difficulties in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One difficulty they faced was when designing the mast. They "couldn't just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building ..." (¶ @ NUM1) because that "would add stress to the framing of the building." (¶ @ NUM1) This was a challenge as the Empire State Building frame had to be changed and strengthened to accommodate it, which resulted in @ MONEY1 in modifications. Another difficulty encountered by builders concerned nature. Since airships use “ hydrogen instead of helium ” (¶ @ NUM3), there was a great risk of fire ; still a problem over New York City. Wind was also a problem. The winds at the top of the building "were constantly changing due to strong drafts" (¶ @ NUM4). The stern of the ship should be heavy with lead; again, impossible in New York. A final difficulty encountered by manufacturers was the existing aviation laws. Manufacturers faced the problem of the existing law against airships "flying too low over urban areas". (¶ @ NUM5) This made it "illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area". (¶ @ NUM5) Some of the many difficulties faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were the design of the masts, the nature and the existing laws on air flights.

Some of the issues they faced while building the Empire State Building were the biggest. build a building this tall and expect it to do things like airships lining. The airship's @ CAPS1 against the building could cause it to collapse. this is why the contractor redesigned the skeleton of the building.

In the passage "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, there was a lot of conflict that the builders encountered while trying to let airships dock at the Empire State Building. One issue was security. Unlike regular balloons, airships were made of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. It would have been a problem if he was above the people on the street and the building. Another problem was nature. The winds, where they would have moored, would have been far too strong. As the passage says, "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong drafts." (@ NUM1). A final reason is that there was a law banning planes from flying near neighborhoods. All and all of the airships hit a lot of people.

Al Smith, a former governor of New York, had a brilliant idea to make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the world. He would put a mooring mast on top of @ CAPS1. airships up so airships can drop passengers down here. But, this plan had many @ NUM1, "The stress of the load of the airship in the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the buildings". This is a problem because if the mast was simply placed on the building it would destroy itself. Another problem is that "most airships outside of the United States use hydrogen." Hydrogen is a very flammable gas and would endanger the whole part of the city under the Zeppelin. The third reason was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas.

In the excerpt from "The @ CAPS1 Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS2, many obstacles are described since the construction of the Empire State Building in New York. Thousands of dollars have been spent on desperate modifications to the building, with the aim of adding a mooring mast at the top for mooring airships or airships. These efforts were, however, unsuccessful. The two main obstacles faced by builders during construction were safety. After an airship fire in New Jersey in 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building " ... realized how much worse this accident could have been had it occurred over a densely packed area. populated like downtown New York ”. (@ NUM1, @ CAPS2) and an existing law banned low airships in urban areas. In addition, the unpredictable winds ultimately put the workers in a very risky and dangerous situation, although the builders faced many obstacles during construction, the airships were never moored on the building.        

<START>

 

The Empire State Building faced several major problems in making a docked airship station. The first is that at that time there was a law prohibiting airships of any kind from landing / mooring in a residential area, let alone a densely populated city. There will also have been many practical problems with the mast, if it was even built. It would have been very difficult to dock the huge airships and keep them there, let alone the extremely flammable hydrogen zeppelins that were often full.   

<START>

 

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were for many different reasons. One of them is the weather, "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." The second is that they have a law against airships, "was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." The problem is also that the airship will be suspended high above the people, it reads: "... they would be suspended high above the pedestrians in the street, it was neither practical nor safe". This is some of the problems they have.    

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building had to face the safety hurdle, to ensure that everyone could board the airship safely without any form of danger. Another obstacle is arranging the airships so that they can pick up passengers from there. @ PERSON1 stated that "the height made it desirable to postpone the final installation of the landing gear to a later date". People didn't want to try it so that would be another hurdle. If people didn't want to try it, it would just become a decoration, and that's not what Al Smith wanted. The final hurdle would be that it wouldn't last long, as the clip says "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was built. ". In other words, the architects didn't think too far into the future to see if the mooring mast would even be used. These are some of the obstacles that manufacturers have faced.       

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when constructing a mast that would allow airships to dock. The biggest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have an airship attached by a single tether cable to stay intact when the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts. The stern of the ship would pivot around the mast, which was dangerous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to change nature, so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle that the builders faced during the construction of the building was that the weight of the airship added a lot of stress (especially with the added wind pressure) to the frame of the building. They then decided that the only way to solve this problem was to transfer the weight to the foundation of the building.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was to attach a mooring mast to the top of the building. Due to the height of the Empire State Building, they couldn't just drop the pole onto the roof as it would have interfered with the overall frame of the building. In order to keep the mooring mast on top of the roof, the architects spent thousands of dollars modifying the building's framing. Another obstacle to mooring airships was preserving the safety of the public below. The airships were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, creating the risk of a massive explosion over New York City and endangering countless lives. Finally, a very important obstacle for the builders was the danger of nature. Strong drafts filled the winds above and around the Empire State Building. Even if an airship was hooked to the roof, the stern of the ship would continue to pivot, further endangering the citizens under the building. These were the obstacles that the builders faced and prevented the fabrication of a mooring mast to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was the frame of the building. In @ LOCATION1 @ NUM1, he explains that attaching a durable material to the building would add stress to the building frame. They had to change the entire frame of the building to a stronger material for the mooring mast to work. One of the biggest obstacles was security. Most sustainable products use hydrogen to fuel them, and hydrogen is highly flammable. There is a great risk that airships will catch fire while flying over an area as densely populated as New York. Another obstacle in the way of the mooring mast was the conditions at the top of the building. At the top of the Empire State Building, there are high winds that would spin the airships around the mooring mast. Finally, an obstacle encountered by manufacturers was the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. As explained in @ LOCATION1, due to this law, it is even illegal to fly to the Empire State Building. With all of these obstacles, it is clear why the mooring mast was not used.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered some problems when trying to allow airships to dock there. They couldn't just allow the airships to land on the flat roof of the building, as it weighed too much and would add stress to the building's frame. The plan never came to fruition for several reasons. A big issue was security. The airships used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The highly flammable substance was too dangerous to be used over New York. The biggest problem was the wind. It was always changing because of the drafts. The airship could be strapped in, but it would float in the air above pedestrians. The plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to allow airships to dock there was unsuccessful.        

<START>

 

When building the Empire State Building, Al Smith believed he had solved the problem of airships having nowhere to land. However, having the building as a mooring place for airships turned out to be much more difficult than it first appeared. First, the balloon would put too much stress on the building frame. The author states: " The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building ... " (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). Also, since this framework would have to be changed, a lot of money would have to be spent. The author declares: "More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the building" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). It was too risky to invest in such an uncertain project. In addition, they realized how dangerous any accident could be in such a populated area. The author explains, "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM3). If anything had happened, a very large part of New York could have suffered. Although the plan to create an airship mast was impressive, it made no financial sense, nor made sense for safety reasons.            

<START>

 

During the construction of the mast, the builders encountered many obstacles to allow the airships to moor to it. The obstacle @ CAPS1 was the building itself. By adding the mast, many stresses would be added to the frame of the building and therefore reinforcing changes had to take place before the mast was erected. Another problem was how to properly tie up the airship, as they usually landed in large open fields, which allowed weights to be placed in the front and back of the airship, they could be properly attached. But since the airship was going to be tied to a mast, there was no way to secure the back of the airship and therefore no safe way to tie the airship. And finally, the last problem that the builders encountered was how to even moor the airship. Since there were such strong winds at the top of the building, there was no possible way to dock the airship unless the weather was perfect. In the end, all of these issues meant that the mast could never be used.       

<START>

 

Many obstacles stood in the way of mooring airships on the state of the empire. One obstacle that the builders faced was the law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. In addition, builders would need to reinforce parts of the building to withstand the stress that airships would place on the chassis. Finally, nature would not allow airships to be moored securely due to the strong winds moving the stern of the airship. causing him to sway wildly. These obstacles ensured that the airships could not be moored to the state of the empire.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were, the airships would add stress to the building frame, the steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and strengthened to accommodate this situation, over sixty thousand dollars was needed to moderate the @ CAPS1 of the building, the biggest obstacle was nature itself as the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong currents of the building. 'air. These were some of the obstacles that the Empire State Builders attempted to allow airships to dock there.

The obstacles faced by builders in making the Empire State Building a mooring point have reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all shapes and sizes, depending on the size of the objective. The size of the goal was huge, so the reach was at its maximum. The issues were law, nature, security and the mooring point. First, the main problem was the location. “ The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. " This would not only have destroyed the whole building, but would have sent him crashing into pedestrians in a radius of eleven hundred feet in the direction in which it was transported. Second, instead of helium, airships used hydrogen instead, "and hydrogen is highly flammable." This poses a safety concern, especially in a densely populated urban area like New York City. Third, the building was so tall that it intercepted higher wind forces. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." This could have made an airship tension against the building or charge against the mooring point. Finally, the law prohibited any "airship from flying too low over urban areas". As high as the Empire State Building was, it was too close to the public. Overall, the builders were unmoved and this created obstacles for the airships to dock with the Empire State Building. They made the goal so big that the obstacles reached their level of difficulty. The Empire State Building's goal may be unsuccessful, but it's still the tallest building ever.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's short story "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing the mask. The entire metal frame of the building should have been reinforced to support the weight of the mast. The mast, which stood over @ NUM1 feet high, would have stressed the steel frame of the building, weakening its foundation. To hold the mast, "more than sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framing of the building." This meant that the builders really had to think about how they were going to ensure that the mast did not bend the steel frame. Another hurdle that builders faced was a new law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, like New York City. Therefore, “ This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area. Because of this law, the mast was used very rarely. Regardless of what they tried, builders would have to make big changes to the Empire State Building's frame in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally intended. The mast helped make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet, but it forced reinforcement and attachment to the building's framing, and the mask was not used as much as the builders thought so.

The builders encountered many obstacles while trying to build the Empire State Building for docked airships. One obstacle was just having "... one tether cable." which they went on to say it would add stress to the building so they had to fix that. They choose to change the frame and strengthen it as well. Another obstacle was having the right equipment. They had to go to the air station @ ORGANIZATION2 for information. The final hurdle would be that the airships were filled with oxygen instead of helium. This meant that it was highly flammable, which had to be taken into account. In trying to make this work for airships, they encountered construction issues, safety issues, and dangerous issues.

When the Empire State Building was built, workers tried to find new ways to @ CAPS1 the structure. They had suddenly found issues with one of them being the top of the Empire State Building.

The masters of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to overcome. First, builders had to compensate for the stress that a moored airship would place on the building. According to @ CAPS1, "the stress ... would be transmitted to the foundations of the building". Therefore, the steel frame of the building should be modified to accommodate the load. Another obstacle encountered by the builders was the weather conditions at this height: “The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts. Any airship attempting to land there would be violently shaken by the wind. Finally, there was the security barrier. As @ CAPS1 reports, "Most airships from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable." @ CAPS3 of a Hindenburg-type accident in a densely populated area made manufacturers think. In conclusion, the builders had to face several enormous obstacles, which, combined, ultimately doomed the project.

In order for the Empire State Building to dock the airships (airships), many obstacles had to be overcome by the architects. One of those obstacles was the framework of the Empire State Building. If a thousand-foot airship were moored to the top of the building with a single tether cable, it would add enormous strain to the building's foundation due to the load on the airships and the pressure of the wind. Another obstacle that architects faced was security. Since the @ LOCATION2 airships used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk that the airship would explode and threaten the dense population of downtown New York. Perhaps the biggest obstacle the architects faced were the high winds. At the top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly changing from the strong air currents. Even though lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the moored airship, they would still be hung dangerously from pedestrians on the streets below. These are some of the obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to dock the airships.

In the passage "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, a myriad of obstacles had encountered the builders of the Empire State Building to allow the airships to dock there. The first was the problem of building a mooring mast above the flat roof of the building. Because " a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether, would add stress to the building frame ," the building would be unable to withstand the stress of the airship and the pressure of the wind. Then safety became an issue. After the discovery that "most airships built outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium and that hydrogen is highly flammable," the owners of the Empire State Building realized the danger. when a highly flammable object flies over a densely populated area. This was brought to their attention when a German airship was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. An additional problem was nature itself. Winds at the top of the building posed the problem of rotating the stern of airships around the mooring mast, as weights could not be used to weigh down the stern as they would be suspended over pedestrians on the street. Finally, there was “an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas”. @ CAPS2, it would be illegal for a vessel to be tied to the vessel or to approach the area. In light of the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there.

Ambitious for the time, the idea of allowing airships to dock atop the Empire State Building was doomed from the start. The engineers and builders of the mooring mast faced many obstacles that could potentially prevent a secure mooring at the top of the building. The first major hurdle was finding a way to tie the airship to the dock. As described in paragraph @ NUM1, "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame." Modifications will have to be made to the entire building. Another obstacle the engineers faced was stabilizing the airship once it was attached to the building. As described in paragraph @ NUM2, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts." This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the airship. These obstacles confused the engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the project was completely abandoned.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the airship to dock there were many and in the end the dock could not happen. One of the obstacles was that the foundations of the buildings had to be changed. In the story it says, "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building which was nearly eleven hundred feet below." Being so high, the wharf would be moved because of the winds. Plus, the airship itself couldn't even attach to the dock because the winds wouldn't allow it. In the end, the wharf was not supposed to arrive, it posed a lot of problems for builders and even artitechs.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, builders encounter many obstacles. Many people would have a hard time creating the documents for the Empire State Building airships. One of the main obstacles faced by the builders was "The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone." Another obstacle they might run into is that airships might take too long to refuel and could cause blockage with other airships. Even though they had this huge obstacle, they made their way around and they found a way to use the airships without any problem.

Based on the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, she describes the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Three of the main obstacles they faced where there was a lack of a proper landing pad, they had to rebuild the frame of the building, and there was a law against that. Airships are huge steel-framed balloons, which have cotton cloth envelopes. They are also filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter and easier to float. Due to the size of the airships, some exceeding a thousand feet, there really was no place to land. " The architects could not just put a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Buildings, it would add a lot of stress to the framing of the buildings " (paragraph @ NUM1). Another hurdle they had to face was that they would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars on the framing of the building just so the building could support the airship. The third obstacle encountered was that there was a law against it. He claimed that there would be no airships flying too low over urban areas. So even if they built a landing pad and spent the sixty thousand dollars on the framing of the building, they couldn't use it because of the law. Even though the idea of having an airship dock on the Empire State Building, the obstacles were too great for the builders with the lack of a suitable landing pad, the rebuilding of the framework and the law against flying planes. too low.

There were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One practical reason there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too close over urban areas like New York City. The law would make it illegal even for an airship to approach the building. The main reason was the issue of security. If a ship were to dock with the use of hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion is possible, injuring everyone below. The biggest obstacle was the changing winds of drafts. Even if tied, the ship would pivot around the tower and become tangled. In conclusion, the idea had to be abandoned, although some ships tried to moor them.

I've been to the Empire State Building before, all the way to the top. The roof was not opened, but several windows were, and what I have left is how windy it is up there. Trying to park an airship on top of the building would be like trying to park a car in a flood, impossible, I was waiting for this factor to make all the history, and it's finally done. “ The winds at the top of the building are constantly changing due to strong air currents ” (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) In addition to parking the airship, passengers should descend on a swinging gangway, which wouldn't be too much fun. Another problem they faced was the law. There was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2) I think before spending @ MONEY1 on an already unrealistic project, they would at least have made sure they were allowed by law. When I read this essay, it seemed like the project was doomed from the start.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing zone. So Al Smith figured that putting a mooring mast at the top of the building would allow airships to dock there for several hours. This would allow airships to refuel or be serviced and allow passengers to get on and off. Another obstacle would be the way the airship would be moored. It would be maintained by a single tether cable, which would add stress to the structure of the building. The stress of the load and pressure of the wind had to be transferred to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. The third obstacle would be the use of hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen, it is highly flammable and the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. These are some of the hurdles that manufacturers have faced in trying to allow airships to dock there.

In "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted talks about the Mooring Mast or also known as the Empire State Building, how it was constructed and the building's original purposes. During the construction of the Empire State Building, builders encountered issues while attempting to allow airships to dock with it, such as architectural issues, various gases, and the law. The builders faced a problem with the architect of the building. The roof was flat because it is said that "the architects could not just put a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building". This meant that the heavy airship would add stress to the frame of the building. flammable. " This meant the building could catch fire and all of downtown New York City. They also faced an issue with the law saying" an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. " . He said it would be illegal to attach a blimp on the building

The excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the construction of the Empire State Building in New York. The excerpt explains the stages in the construction of the building as well as the obstacles and challenges the builder faced. The architects of the construction of the Empire State Building tried to allow airships to dock there, did not take into account the problems that could arise when carrying out a project of such a scale. The creator of this plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was Al Smith. Al Smith was so excited to build the mast that he didn't think about the complications associated with his " main " plan . Due to the stress of the airship and the pressure of the wind, it was necessary to reinforce the structure of the building which cost more than sixty thousand dollars. The biggest obstacle for the builders was a question of safety. Most airships use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was known to be very flammable. If something like this happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. There was also a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This snippet shows that before you embark on a big challenge, you must examine and take into account the obstacles that may arise from it.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were crashes over densely populated areas, ever-changing violent air currents, and more.

The idea of putting a pole on top of the empire building @ CAPS1 like a brilliant idea. People thought it would be a great idea to tie up an airship to the mast, especially because "New York City lacked proper landing zones." But it is easy from @ CAPS2 how the mooring mast could never moor the drigibles. One of the reasons this could never happen is that @ CAPS3 of these airships contained hydrogen which is highly flammable. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey ... the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been." People @ CAPS3 would die if this happened in a densely populated area. Another reason the mast could never be used was that there was "an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas". @ CAPS4 even if everything was set up correctly they would be breaking the law by flying airships @ CAPS4 near town. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be too unpredictable above the Empire State Building. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts." The mooring mast would just be a totally unstable place to moor these drigibles.

In attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects encountered many problems. One of those problems was the framing of the buildings. The frame had to be modified and reinforced to accommodate the new mast. Another major obstacle was security. In paragraph @ NUM1, the author declares that "hydrogen is highly flammable". If an airship climbed into @ CAPS1, not only would passengers be in danger, but everyone in the crowded streets below. Winds at such a high altitude were also a threat. Paragraph @ NUM2 explains that strong air currents would cause the stern of the ship to swing in all directions, making it difficult to unload passengers. These are just a few of the many problems that builders encountered when attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building.

In the snippet, the builders wanted the airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. They found out that they couldn't do it because the winds would push the airships in all different directions. And there was also a law that aircraft had to be at a certain height in the air.

When the Empire State Building was designed, it was intended to be the tallest building in the world, taller than the new Chrysler Building which was being built at 42nd Street. and lexington Avenue in New York. The top of the Empire State Building must be more than ornamental, more than a spire, dome or pyramid. The Age of Airships. The Navy was the leader in the research and development of airships in the United States. architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the skeleton of the building.

The hurdles faced by the builders were that they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. The Empire State Building's steel frame would need to be modified and reinforced to accommodate this new situation. The main reason was safety: Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. The stern of the vessel would pivot around and around the mooring mast. existing law against airships flying too low.

Some of the obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced were high-altitude winds, laws that did not allow airships to be so close to an urban area, passenger safety, and pedestrian safety. below. .

It was unrealistic and dangerous for the engineers to think they could tie airships to the building. A major problem with the idea that the airship would add stress to the structure of the building. In addition, the weight of the airship and the wind pressure would be a problem for the foundation. Another thing, airships were made of hydrogen which is highly flammable, and if any of them had exploded it would have been a disaster for downtown New York. This is why the idea is neither practical nor secure.

According to the excerpt " The Mooring @ CAPS1 " by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered certain obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there, such as strong drafts. and pedestrian safety. One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced strong drafts. According to the excerpt, the winds at the top of the building were constantly turning. So if an airship got caught in that, it would swing way over pedestrians. For example, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong air currents. Even though the airship was attached to the mooring @ CAPS1 at the stern of the ship with pivoting around and around the mooring mast . " (@ NUM1) Another obstacle was the safety of pedestrians. When the owners learned that the German airship Hindenburg had been destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they decided it would be even worse if it had taken place in a densely populated place like New York City. An example of this would be, "the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area like downtown New York. " In conclusion, the excerpt, "The Mooring Mast", written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered some obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. Such as strong drafts and city pedestrians.

The Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow airships to dock there. This building being so large, and the big wind changes were a constant concern. Wind changes is when the direction of the wind suddenly changes. One minute it's @ LOCATION1, the next it's @ LOCATION2. On May 6, 1937, when the German airship Hindenburg caught fire, people thought about what would have happened if it was the Empire State Building. over New York, with such a large population, it would have been hectic. Airships weren't allowed to fly that low anyway.      

<START>

 

The task of trying to get airships to dock 1,250 feet above New York City didn't come as a shock to create some obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building. Before the airships could even try to moor on the mast, the builders had to modify the whole building because of the stresses and pressures exerted on the building by the airships. The modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building after the builders finally completed all the modifications and construction ; they faced a whole new set of obstacles. Most airships from the United States were filled with flammable hydrogen. "German airship @ CAPS1 was destroyed by fire at @ LOCATION3, New Jersey". This accident worried @ CAPS2. They also encountered issues with the changing winds and drafts which made it difficult to dock the airships. Another obstacle was the fact that laws existed against airships flying too low to the ground. Due to these unforeseen obstacles, the idea of mooring at the top of the building disappeared.         

<START>

 

From the information provided in the snippet, there are many obstacles that they could not have been overcome by the builders of the Empire State Building. Between the winds, the anchoring issues, the risk of fire and the sharp arrows, there were also legal issues that had to be overcome first. One thing the builders of the Empire State Building hadn't considered was the wind flow. Because airships were mostly huge powered balloons, the wind could push them, and at 1,250 feet, there isn't much around to slow down or block the wind. They also didn't think of @ CAPS1 as hydrogen, a key gas involved in lifting airships, was highly flammable and if one were to go up in @ CAPS2, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people would be doomed. No more problems the architects faced were the sharp spiers on top of many buildings around. If a pilot were to lose control of the beep, it would cause @ MONEY1 damage to the city. Finally, a new law was being drafted. It prohibited the flight of all air travel below a certain footing in residential areas.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. One of the main hurdles was safety : " Most airships outside of [@ LOCATION2] used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable ." Owners quickly realized how dangerous an accident would be "over a densely populated area like downtown New York." The second major obstacle was nature; " The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents ." A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building would add enormous stress to the framing of the building. In the end, these two obstacles would be too great. Times were changing and with the airplane taking over modern travel, the airship and mooring mast were doomed.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when it came to allowing airships to dock on the building's mooring mast. They first had to modify this top into a mooring mast and the steel frame of the building had to be modified to accommodate the airship. They also had to set up a mooring and ticketing area, which also cost money. They also had the problem if the airship hit something or caught fire from its hydrogen gas. Nature itself was the biggest problem because near the building the winds were strong. There was also a law stating that airships or airships could not fly too low over urban areas. If the hull broke, the airship could injure many people.

When building a structer as tall as the Empire State Building and even docking an airship at the top, there will be challenges to overcome. So that he moored. The stress of the load of airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundations of the buildings. The building should be @ CAPS1. All of these issues must be taken into consideration. It would mean spending more money     

<START>

 

When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow airships to dock there, they had good intentions but encountered obstacles along the way. This job was not an easy thing to accomplish, it is not as easy as it seems. If the builders added a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, it would add stress to the building frame. All the stresses would be transmitted to the foundation of the building, so they would have to modify and strengthen the steel. It would cost more than @ MONEY1, and that's a lot. The biggest obstacle was nature itself, the wind at the top was constantly changing. It wouldn't be safe either. There was also a law prohibiting airships from rolling too low and that would allow them to land. Also, since other airships in other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, it could easily cause a fire. The main obstacle for builders was safety when building this, there were a lot of dangerous outcomes so it was too risky to build.         

<START>

 

One of the hurdles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was that constructing the mooring mast would add stress to the building due to its height. The architects, however, were able to design a special type of stainless steel that would be illuminated from within and provide support. Another obstacle was that airships used hydrogen instead of helium, and having such an airship with flammable gas near civilization was considered unreasonable. Thus, a law was passed prohibiting the transport of airships near the public. Nature was also against the architects and therefore posed a safety hazard when high speed winds attempted to @ CAPS1 airships from the sky while being weighed down by lead weights. In the end, the Empire State Building's mooring mast was never used because of these issues.     

<START>

 

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. They knew the mooring mast was not perfect. There were many reasons, but the most important in their view was safety. The hydrogen they contain is highly flammable and after the New Jersey accident in 1937, they noticed how much more dangerous it would be if it happened in New York. So they abandoned the idea later and left the transport to the planes.    

<START>

 

There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. A major issue was the added stress to the building's framing when the airship carried it to the top of the building. "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." This meant they had to rearrange the framework to make it work. Therefore, the workers were never able to achieve the goal. Safety was a major factor in the failure of the airship mooring to @ ORGANIZATION1 the airships were highly flammable which could have resulted in a serious accident. However, the "biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". @ CAPS1 there were strong drafts above the building, this would cause the airship to "rotate" when attached to the mooring mast. There was also a law prohibiting planes from flying low over urban areas, making it impossible for airships to reach the building. Due to all these obstacles, the main objective of mooring the airships was not achieved.         

<START>

 

The obstacles the builders faced involved the safety of those under the airship and those within. One problem they faced was if something happened to the airship like the Hindenburg. Then, pedestrians below could be injured if the zeppelin crashed. It was also a problem with the passengers because in a city they could easily crash. He tells how, when the "Los Angeles" tried to get close enough, it could not because the strong winds so high could have thrown it into another building. Nature and the law were other obstacles encountered by builders. When the wind is high, the currents can be very strong and changeable. He explained that if the airship was tied up, the wind would continue to pivot the stern of the ship around the mooring mast. The last stubborn builders should overcome the law. There were already laws in place preventing airships from flying low in urban areas. If the ships had attached themselves to the vessel, they would have done so illegally.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. the builders then had to resolve certain obstacles that stood in their way. The first was that the building itself had to be reinforced in order to support "a thousand foot airship moored at the top of the building". According to the snippet, changes worth @ MONEY1 had to be made to the building structure. Another problem was that of the constraint of wind pressure. Wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This was also fixed, at least they thought, by making some modifications to the skeleton of the building. Finally, did the building need a space to accommodate the passengers who were to come from the "airships". To solve the problem, they built a well to bring passengers to the @ NUM1 floor, where the baggage and ticket areas would be. The builders had to face many problems before even trying to build a mast for the airships to be moored.

Various obstacles have arisen in this excerpt. This mooring mast building simply went from a dream to a way to win the record for the tallest building in the world. The biggest obstacle they faced was the issue of security. In paragraph @ NUM1, it says "Most airships used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." @ CAPS1, one obstacle encountered was the danger that the airship would be destroyed by fire while attempting to tie up to the Empire State Building, which would cause extensive destruction in New York. The builders, too, were confronted with the problem of nature itself. Strong air currents at these heights would cause the airship to deflect around the mooring mast. Manufacturers were also faced with a legal problem indicating in paragraph @ NUM2 "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas". @ CAPS1, airships were never going to be allowed to fly so close to the Empire State Building anyway. These were the obstacles encountered by manufacturers.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. In paragraph nine, it is stated that " architects could not simply lay a mooring mast above the flat roofs of Empire State buildings ". This obstacle was enormous because to accommodate the new station, more than sixty thousand dollars of work had to be carried out in the building. Another reason, as stated in paragraph @ NUM1 "The other practical reason why airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas. " This shows that this was another major hurdle for manufacturers. Another obstacle for builders is nature, as stated in paragraph @ NUM2 "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts." it could be very dangerous. If the stern of the ship were to hang over the streets surrounding the Empire State Building, there could be many safety hazards. These obstacles were the main obstacles that builders faced if the Empire State Building were to be a landing dock.

According to the excerpt from " The Mooring Mast " by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there, such as security, nature and legislation. First, it would be difficult to safely allow foreign airships to dock. In paragraph @ NUM1 it says : "Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." This shows that fire, and therefore safety, was an obstacle. Second, the drafts made it difficult to moor the airships safely. The air near the top of the building was affected by drafts, so it was difficult for the pilots to land. Further, "the use of [lead weights] at the Empire State Building, where they would be hung over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe." There was no way to work with or combat the uncertainty of the wind, so nature was an obstacle. Finally, there were laws on planes flying too close to the city. In paragraph @ NUM2 it is written : “ [There] was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel. " The very purpose of the moor would be illegal, it would be almost impossible for an airship to focus on the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges regarding the moor, and its opening was never successful because of them.

In the short clip, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle they faced was space. An example “ The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. ” @ CAPS1 saying it was going to be difficult to find a place to land. While this could have been one of their issues, it wasn't the only issue, it was safety. The excerpt says that "the mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service and let passengers get on and off." Which meant it would have taken a while to land and refuel. Another hurdle was for airships to be tested in the mast test

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered a few obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. The biggest obstacle was finding a safe way to do it. New York City is a very densely populated area, so any kind of accident would be horrible, as the owners realized in @ CAPS2 @ NUM1, “When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been had it occurred over a densely populated area such as @ CAPS1. " Another obstacle was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building was too strong as it says in @ CAPS2 @ NUM2, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong drafts. Even though the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the vessel would pivot around the mooring mast. " Safety was clearly the biggest concern

Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced law banning airships flying low over urban areas. this zone. It would harm the airship. Then another airship attempted a publicity stunt, when it tied up and delivered a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. The idea of mooring was abandoned. They had not yet solved the problems of mooring aerial vessels to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable. The highest open observation platform, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public.

The manufacturer's main problem with safety. Most airships that are not manufactured at @ LOCATION1 are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If a disaster like the Hindenburg accident had occurred as the airship moved toward the Empire State Building tie-downs, the result would have been much more catastrophic. Another obstacle is the wind. According to the excerpt, “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong air currents… the stern of the ship circled around the mooring mast. " A final hurdle was the law prohibiting airships too low flying over urban areas. "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel."

For example, on the excerpt, it says: "A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to get passengers on and off." It shows that builders had to build a mooring mast to have a little time for refueling or maintenance and people get off and back up safely. Still, passengers could safely get on and off the airship by descending a gangway to an open observation deck. " This shows that manufacturers are building a gateway for people to get on or off the bridge safe airship.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many different obstacles. One was the Empire State who built it @ CAPS1. It's one of the tallest buildings in the world, so only a bad building plan could be tragic for everyone below. When construction of the mooring mast began, they knew there was some risk, but they didn't think it was happening. See it all was introduced because Al Smith wanted the Empire State to be the greatest. Now he didn't examine @ CAPS2 if an airship was @ CAPS3 on the mooring mast they would have to worry about weather conditions, wind and the strength of building foundations. Also, they should be worried about the airship he @ CAPS1 at the time the airships were filled with hydrogen and if something should go wrong in downtown New York and the airship should catch a spark , it would burn four blocks.

The Empire State Building @ CAPS1 encountered many problems when attempting to allow airships to dock there. Some of the problems are that some airships are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. If an airship containing hydrogen exploded over @ LOCATION1, it wouldn't be so good for the people of New York. These people could die. Additionally, an airship detonated in New Jersey, the airship contained hydrogen. So when that happened, they thought a lot about the docking station and only allowed airships that contained helium to dock there.     

<START>

 

The idea of allowing airships to dock on the Empire State Building was fraught with issues ranging from natural preventions to pre-existing laws. During the days of frequent airship trips around the world, a German airship called the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey due to a complication with a fire. This disaster revealed to workers a problem they had previously overlooked, the fact that most foreign airships were inflated with flammable hydrogen gas. The idea of a problem like Hindenburg's on one of the most densely populated cities in the world dismissed the idea. Workers on this project also ignored laws banning airships flying too low over urban areas. Although the Empire State Building is supposed to be the tallest building in the world, the soon-to-be-built pole is still said to be too close to the city's millions of people. After trials to test the new mooring system, it was found that the airships were not even able to get close enough to the mast due to the strong winds. The thought that those same winds would blow the airship into another spire of buildings scared people. The combination of this variety of issues ended the idea of using a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.

Al Smith and the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. The first hurdle was designing reinforcing beams on the frame and foundation to withstand the extra stresses caused by the airship load and wind pressure. The second was that the gases used in some airships were dangerous. "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (Lüsted, @ NUM1). The inefficiency of the gases, the violent air currents would entail either the expense of the airship, or the addition of lead weights which "... would be suspended above the pedestrians" (Lüsted, @ NUM2). Among all these problems, "... there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas" (Lüsted, @ NUM3). Therefore, not only was it dangerous or impractical, it was illegal.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there.

Another obstacle they encountered was that there was a "law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas" (@ NUM2). Therefore, it would be illegal to tie up a ship to the building because the airship would be too low. Finally, the most difficult obstacle they encountered was that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts" (@ NUM3). This made it dangerous and impractical as airships would be above pedestrians on the street. Due to all the complications and challenges faced by workers attempting to allow the airships to dock on the Empire State Building, the project was never completed.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One of those obstacles was that it was not safe. This was dangerous because airships use more hydrogen than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. In the excerpt it is said that the biggest obstacle was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and the back of the airship was pivoting.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when they attempted to allow airships to dock. One of the main reasons was that it was illegal for airships to dock. “The Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,” @ CAPS1 @ NUM1. In addition, mother nature prevented airships from docking there. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents", @ CAPS1 @ NUM2. However, some airships attempted to dock. In 1930, the US Navy, Los Angeles tried to dock, but due to high winds it was unable to. New York was a very densely populated area, and having explosive hydrogen floating above the city could pose a huge threat. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey." This showed the builders and owners of the Empire State Building that it was very dangerous for airships trying to tie up to it. One of the main problems faced by builders was making the building itself strong enough for airships to dock. The builders had to modify the framework of the Empire State Building and design a custom mooring device. The builders faced legal and safety concerns when they attempted to allow the airships to dock on the Empire State Building.

Marcia Amidon Lüsted's Mooring Mast explains plans to add a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that could have anchored airships to the top of it. This idea was very complex; however, the architects of the time (@ DATE1's) believed it was entirely possible. What they didn't seem to realize was the number of issues and obstacles that could hinder the mast's success. A minor downside was that the mast (and the airship attached to it) would add great stress to the frame of the building. This problem was solved with little stress by simply modifying the reinforcement of the building's foundation and frame. The biggest obstacle to the mast's success was the strong winds at the top of the building, which "constantly shifted due to strong drafts." However, the biggest problem that arose was the safety of the public. Most foreign airships at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which ultimately explains why the mooring mast was never successful.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. Throughout the excerpt, the author states that " airships were hailed as the transport of the future " (paragraph @ NUM1). It meant the builders had to work harder and find ways to make it work. Architects and engineers spoke with experts about the equipment needed to build the airships. The author also states that they asked people to test the airship. They had to work on the mooring mast in order for the airship to function properly. Operating the mooring mast was very difficult for the builders. In paragraph @ NUM2 it says that "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". Airships were fundamentally abandoned in the 1930s.

The obstacles ; the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with the attempt to allow airships to dock there was very difficult. They took care of the frames and the shapes, but there are other reasons that are not so physical. One of the biggest obstacles they faced in allowing airships to dock on the building was nature itself. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly changing due to strong drafts. Use of the Empire State Building, where airships would hang above pedestrians on the lower level of the street, was unsafe. Another particular obstacle they faced was; an existing law against airships flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to tie the airship to the Empire State Building itself. Airships could not climb onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of obstacles in front of them. Not just physical objects to facilitate the landing of airships, but also the @ CAPS1 of politics and nature.

In this clip of Marcia Amidon's mooring mast, there were plenty of examples of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle that the builders faced was the weight and pressure of a DiriGiBle @ CAPS1 on @ CAPS2 an antenna on top of the Empire State Building. it was a big @ CAPS3 because all the tension and pressure in the rope would pull on the building sending the pressure all the way to the bottom of the building a thousand feet below. another obstacle that workers faced was nature itself. it was a @ CAPS3 because of the high speed winds in the building moving all the time. If a DiriGiBle were to be tied at the top by a single rope at the front, the rear of it would be free to move in the wind. this would allow the back to be able to be blown by the wind having the possibility of hitting the building. In conclusion, the builders had to face many obstacles to attempt this project.

In the excerpt "THE MOORING MAST" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the workers had to face many obstacles to allow the Airships to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. One of the many obstacles workers encountered was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Also the thousand foot airships moored atop the Empire State Building. Only one tether cable held the airship and that would add stress to the building's frame. The biggest obstacle the workers would face was the mooring mast at the top of the building with all the winds rotating due to the strong drafts. Another obstacle was that the airships were moored in the open field and were ballasted at the rear. The problem was, they were swinging over pedestrians on the street. These are the obstacles workers faced

In @ ORGANIZATION2's “The Mooring Mask”, the obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced were nature, safety and the law. Al Smith, @ CAPS1 from New York and responsible for the construction of the Empire State Building, was determined to make it the tallest building ever. This would be impossible without a mooring mast, which would serve as a mooring station for airships. During the construction of the mooring mast, obstacles came up. One obstacle was nature. There were violent wind speeds at the top of the building, causing the airship to sway back and forth. Lead weights were typically used to avoid swaying, but if used here the lead weights would hang NUM1 feet above the heads of pedestrians. So security is another barrier. Many airships were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The last obstacle is the law. There is a law that says “ airships cannot fly too low over urban areas ”. Which would make the purpose of the mooring mast illegal. Today, it's just decoration.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction. The main reason was security. First, there was a chance it could catch fire. For example, most airships are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They realized how much damage it could cause if it caught fire in a densely populated area, like downtown New York. Second, they had another obstacle to the successful use of mooring which was nature itself. For example, the wind at the top of the building was constantly changing due to the strong drafts. Finally, airships could not dock with the Empire State Building because it was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to or even approach the vessel. Instead of becoming the means of transportation of the future, the idea was gone. They faced many obstacles that could not be overcome.

They ran into some problems when he @ CAPS1 to build it. They realized afterwards that it wasn't so smart or so safe to have an airship hanging from a 102-story building just by a cable tie. Another problem they encountered was the fact that they couldn't control Mother Nature. If it was a very windy day it would be difficult to keep it steady. And if there wasn't enough support on the building's frames, then it could potentially collapse.    

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple potential issues in allowing airships to dock there. For example, the strong winds over city streets could have caused the airship's back and blown sideways and pierced the roofs of other buildings. Additionally, many airships used hydrogen instead of helium, which made them highly flammable. Also, the added stress of an airship docked on the Empire State Building could easily have cracked or collapsed the building and its foundations. Fortunately, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough common sense to stop production of the mast, as it was simply an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in trying to allow airships (airships) to dock there. The lack of a suitable landing zone was a difficult obstacle. It is illegal for airships to fly low over urban areas. It would be hanging over the people and it wouldn't be safe. The way airships stay in the air is that they use hydrogen instead of helium, but hydrogen is extremely flammable. Having a dock for airships on the Empire State Building wouldn't be safe and the builders would have to think of a new plan so there would be a lot of obstacles.     

<START>

 

During @ DATE1, technology and engineering weren't as advanced. So it's safe to say that the builders of the Empire State Building had so many obstacles. One of them was, how were they going to dock the airship safely and keep it stable, they had an idea. They had the knowledge or the technology to do such a thing at the time.   

<START>

 

There were many obstacles to allowing airships to dock on the Empire State Building. One issue that was resolved was the fact that airships around the world were mostly filled with hydrogen, which was flammable. This was a problem because on May 6, 1937 an airship was destroyed by fire and the owners of the Empire State Building realized "how much worse this accident could have been had it taken place in an area densely populated ". (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) Another potential problem was the strong wind currents at the top of the building, as described in @ CAPS1 @ NUM2. The concern was that these strong currents would prevent an airship from docking and could possibly blow it into another building. It could puncture the airship material and cause a horrific accident. The final obstacle preventing airships from docking with the Empire State Building was the fact that it was against the law. The law stated that "airships flying low over urban areas" were prohibited. There were many obstacles preventing airships from docking with the Empire State Building.        

<START>

 

In this @ CAPS1 "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION1, the Empire State Building builder faced a lot of @ CAPS2 during the construction of the Empire State Building. The obstacle @ CAPS3 would be the wind. Because the building was so tall and the more air and wind there was, they had to stop landing or put down the airship. An airship is also a balloon or blump but there is different because airships can be controlled by pappelleurs. Another reason was the @ CAPS4 equipment. They didn't have the right equipment to dock the airship. So they @ CAPS5 to let them dock there again. They also have @ CAPS6 to stop it as there are over hundreds of civilians and if something happens @ CAPS4 the balloon could fall on the civilians. These are the reasons why in the @ CAPS1- "The Mooring Mast" of @ ORGANIZATION1 had to face problems with mooring balloons.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. For example, “ Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over an area like downtown New York. When builders realized that hydrogen is flammable, they had to rethink construction because if there was a fire it would be much more dangerous in a populated area like New York. The risk of injury or injury is more likely. Another obstacle was that “ airships could not dock with the Empire State Building [because] of an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for vessels to attach to the vessel or even approach the area. This was a major obstacle because the builders would have broken a law. It would also be very dangerous.    

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was that the winds at the top of the building were moving very strongly due to the drafts. Because of this, the end of the airship would pivot around the top of the building. Another problem was people walking the @ CAPS1 from New York under the building. To stop an airship, heavy lead weights had to be used. This was problematic as one of the weights could easily be lost and @ DATE1. The law regarding an airship flying too low over a city would be broken if an airship had been parked in the Empire State Building.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. Safety was an important issue; if human lives are in danger, an idea is unlikely to succeed. Most foreign airships contain hydrogen, a " highly flammable " element (paragraph @ NUM1) and posing a threat not only to passengers, but also to people at the docking station. Another potential obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. These winds would cause the back of the airship to blow freely with the wind. Even the proposed solution of weighing down the rear of the airship with lead weights was dangerous; the weights would be left “ hanging well above the pedestrians ” (paragraph @ NUM2). A final very obvious hurdle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the pre-existing law banning airships that fly "too low over urban areas" (paragraph @ NUM3). Even with a secure docking station, landing would be illegal. While it might have seemed like a workable plan at the time, the idea of docking airships atop the Empire State Building was neither safe nor practical.

While construction on the Empire State Building was underway, builders encountered many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock with it. At first people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the "transport of the future". One of the obstacles faced by builders was the fact that a large airship moored to the roof would have negative effects on the structure of the building. "The stress of the load of airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." Builders should pay @ MONEY1 to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of security. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." Additionally, even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, high winds would cause the stern of the ship to pivot around and around the mooring mast. sure ; because the lead would be " hanging high above the pedestrians in the street." There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Nature itself presented many more problems, such as the winds blowing the airship on the “sharp arrows of other buildings.” As many problems became apparent after the building was completed, the idea that airships would be the "future of transport" has been abandoned.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's excerpt "The Mooring Mast", the builders encountered many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. "the still unresolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made a postponement desirable". This quote from Irving Clavan says that there are a lot of unresolved issues because of the height being made. Which means it's harder to do because of its height. "Most airships outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." They point this out because if ever a chance ever goes to waste and it starts to crumble, it falls on one of the most populous cities in America. These are obstacles that manufacturers must face.

In The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow the airships to dock there. The obstacles encountered by the manufacturers were that they realized that hydrogen was very flammable. An example of the snippet is that a German airship caught fire, so builders thought how much worse it would have been in a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the use of the mooring mast. The winds at the top of the building were strong and made it difficult to land. It was also a law that prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building then decided not to use the mooring mast for airships.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in an attempt to allow the airship to dock there. One obstacle they faced was that if a thousand-foot airship was tied to the top of the building with a single tether cable, it would add stress to the building's framing. Another obstacle they faced was that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen, not helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. These are some of the obstacles they encountered while trying to tie up to the building.      

<START>

 

There seem to have been many issues with the construction of the airship dock. On the one hand, the natural structure of the Empire State Building cannot support its weight. Therefore, the architects had to make a tower of stainless steel. Even after this was done, they realized how flammable helium and hydrogen are. Not only that the waves at the top of this building are extremely violent. The idea was eventually forgotten due to the possible accidents that could occur.     

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building had to face several obstacles to construct a mooring mast for the airships at the dock. The first obstacle was the inadequate frame on the building itself because with a mooring mast on top, a lot of stress would be added to the building. It is said that "over sixty thousand dollars in structural modifications had to be made" which could also be a cost issue. Second, building a mooring mast for airships above the densely populated city of New York would be extremely dangerous. Airships from foreign countries used hydrogen to keep them afloat, and "hydrogen is highly flammable." @ CAPS1 the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, any fire over heavily populated New York City would have disastrous effects. Then the worst obstacle that the builders faced were the winds that "constantly shifted due to the strong air currents". @ CAPS2 a thousand foot long airship on top of the Empire State Building would be very dangerous as the winds would blow behind the airship causing the ship to rotate around the mast. The last hurdle the Empire State Building builders faced in allowing airships to dock there was "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." Even if the mast construction were successful, the law prohibiting airships from getting too close would prevent its use. All these obstacles encountered by the builders led to the final failure of the mast.          

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. While some of these hurdles were fixed early on, others didn't come to the attention of builders until later. The first obstacle encountered by the builders was the modifications to be made to the structure of the building. "The Empire State Building's steel frame should be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation." (@ New CAPS1). The Empire State Building could not have supported the mooring mast without having had the essential modifications carried out. This process cost an additional sixty thousand dollars. The second hurdle that the builders faced was not even raised until after the building was completed. The wind factor had made mooring the airships almost impossible. "Even if the airships were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). With all the pedestrians located on the ground, this factor made him extremely dangerous. The last obstacle encountered was the law. Under the law already in force, airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. Airships moored to the mooring mast would violate this law. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building clearly did not consider what was needed to build the mooring mast.               

<START>

 

When architects and engineers planned to build the airship docking dock on the Empire State Building, they didn't realize all the problems that might arise. One of those issues was a big security issue. Most airships used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If an airship caught fire on the Empire State, it would end in disaster. Another obstacle was nature. The wind was unpredictable and the airships simply swayed in the wind. If the wind got too strong it could add a lot of stress to the building and it could collapse. One last reason was a real law. The law stated that it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The mooring dock on the building would never have worked.          

<START>

 

When attempting to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Most of the airships used at the time were from countries other than @ LOCATION1, so they used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, so if it caught fire it would descend into a heavily populated area. Another obstacle was at this height, the wind was very strong and violent. When attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the airship would get caught in the wind and swing around the mooring mast. The final hurdle was that there was a law stating that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas, preventing an airship from approaching the building.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of hurdles in trying to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was a safety barrier, most airships outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another obstacle that builders faced was nature itself. The gains at the top of the building are constantly changing due to dangerous drafts. These winds caused the aft end of the airship to move around the mooring mast. A third hurdle they faced was a law prohibiting planes from flying too low over pedestrian areas. This law makes it illegal to attach to the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, including nature, safety, and the law, when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. The first immediate concern of the builders concerned the structure of the building. Once asleep, the airship would " add stress to the building ." To counter this additional weight, the building would need to be modified and reinforced. Builders were also concerned for safety after a German airship was destroyed in a fire. Since the gas used to keep airships in the air is highly flammable, and downtown New York City is so densely populated, they realized it could be very dangerous. The biggest obstacle was the strong winds at the top of the building which "moved constantly due to the strong drafts". With the airship attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would swivel in the wind. While lead weights can be used in open airstrips, they would not be safe or practical when hung over pedestrians on streets. Finally, there was a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This would make it impossible even for an airship to approach the building. The combination of these obstacles made it impossible to dock the airships to the Empire State Building.

In the snippet, there were a few hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The biggest issue with allowing airships to use the building as a docking site was security. He mentions in paragraph @ NUM1 that the German airship, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. This led to believe that it was taking place at the Empire State Building. If an airship caught fire while attached to the building, there would be a high fatality rate due to the density of New York City. Another obstacle would have been to prevent the airships from rotating around the mooring mast. In paragraph @ NUM2, it would be quite dangerous to have lead weights in the back of the ship with so many pedestrians in the street below. Another reason why it was impractical to try to increase airships towards the building was "an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas" (paragraph @ NUM3). This made it illegal for ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to get close. All of these reasons relate to the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without injury.         

<START>

 

The hurdles the builders faced were rational, but there are some things you should think about first, like life safety, aircraft heights, and wind. They thought about how to tie it down, how to get the passengers safely to the landing pad. What they worked on was smart though, they had the thing that connects the airships to the dock, the electric winch. They had a baggage and ticket area. What they were thinking was smart, but the other things first.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when they attempted to install a dock for airships on top. In order to make New York the most modern city for traveling, Al Smith attempted to put an airship dock atop the Empire State Building. They finished building the mooring mast, although the building's steel frame had to be reinforced. The stress of people boarding the airship could damage the original frame. When completed, there were @ NUM1 attempts to get passengers to board the airships. Although they both ended in failure. The builders have not been able to overcome the obstacles of high winds and laws. The winds could blow the stray airship into another building. In addition, if a hydrogen airship was used, it could cause a fatal accident due to its high flammability. Finally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying near urban areas. The architects of the mooring mast were unable to overcome these challenges.          

<START>

 

Obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The biggest obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his state building empire. A group of engineers and government officials in Washington are looking for a safe way to tie airships to this mast. The biggest obstacle itself was mother nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. These are just some of the many obstacles the Empire State Building encountered when attempting to let airships dock there.      

<START>

 

Here are the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. They were concerned that the hydrogen and helium were highly flammable and given the disaster of the Lakehurst fire in New Jersey. They were also concerned about the stern weight of the ship. And they were worried that the wind would blow it through the arrows of the building, which would pierce the shell of the airship.   

<START>

 

Many obstacles approached the builders of the Empire State Building as they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. Builders have put reality ahead of theory in order to choose the safest route to moor an airship. Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, builders realized how dangerous it could be to put that risk in such a densely populated area as New York. The biggest obstacle to being able to dock safely was nature. The winds atop the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to the strong air currents. This would cause the ship to oscillate around the Mooring @ CAPS1, becoming dangerous. The Mooring @ CAPS1 project failed in the late 1930s to protect the people of downtown New York.

There are many reasons why the builder encountered so many obstacles while attempting to allow airships to dock there. In paragraph @ NUM1, the excerpt states that most airships from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium and that hydrogen is highly flammable. Hydrogen can start a fire and destroy the Empire State Building and can destroy downtown New York City. Another reason the builder ran into obstacles when trying to allow airships to dock there was that it was against the law. In paragraph @ NUM2, the excerpt indicates that there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. It could be dangerous for the citizens of downtown New York.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in the idea of mooring an airship to a building of this height. Airships, primarily outside the United States, were made with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas which was very dangerous over a densely populated area like downtown @ LOCATION2. Safety was a major concern, an accident like Hindenburg was something they didn't want to risk. The ability to moor a light flyer was also very difficult. With strong winds, once the tethor cable was attached, the rear of the aircraft would be blown out, making the airship aviator difficult to control. In addition, a law stating that planes cannot fly too low towards buildings was enacted especially after the Hindenburg incident in New Jersey. An airship could eventually strike an arrow from another building The reality of docking these light aircraft was a major safety concern and difficult. It was these obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced.

The Empire State Building's original plan was to be the tallest building in the world, @ NUM1 feet. Everything was going well until the competition. The Chrysler Building, threatened to steal the title. When Al Smith announced that he would only go for a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, that obviously changed the architects' designs. “The architects designed a tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel that would be illuminated from the inside, with a recessed design that would mimic the general shape of the building. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners ... and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. " (Lüsted). Two months after the workers started with the new plan, they were celebrated because they had finished framing the entire building. "The Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been visible before it was built. The biggest reason was safety. " (Lüsted)       

<START>

 

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was that the frame of the building was not prepared for it. In paragraph @ NUM1, it says "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." The frame of the building could not support an airship at the dock. To solve this problem, more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications would have had to be made. Another hurdle faced by manufacturers was that most countries other than the United States use hydrogen instead of helium to fly airships there. Hydrogen was highly flammable, and builders believed that if an accident like the one in Hindenburg happened in a densely populated area like New York City, it would be devastating. The biggest obstacle that the builders encountered was the constantly changing wind at the top of the building. The changing winds were caused by very strong air currents. While the Digarble was attached to the mast, the rear of the mast would continue to circle. They couldn't use sinkers to help keep the zeppelin steady, because you couldn't just hang heavy sinkers over New York City. From the start, the idea of allowing airships to dock at the Empire State Building was ludicrous.             

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building ran into a few hurdles while trying to allow airships to dock there. The first obstacle they encountered was having to modify and reinforce the steel frame of the building. They had to do this because the stress of the airship load and the wind pressure had to be transmitted to the foundation of the building. Another hurdle they had to face, they had to add more floors to the building to make a total of 102 floors. The 101st floor was a glazed observation area and an open observation deck on the 102nd floor.    

<START>

 

The builders who tried to build a dock on the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles. First, the girigibles were like huge balloons, @ CAPS1 they were made of hydrogen and helium. According to the expert, "Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." (pg @ NUM1.) @ CAPS1, if an airship catches fire while parked near the Empire State Building, it can also catch fire at the Empire State Building. This results in a dangerous environment for employees and passengers. Second, attempting to attach an airship to a building is known to be illegal. Of the expert, he said: "The other practical reason airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." If anyone disobeys this law, it may result in punishment; as a result, it would create a new hurdle that manufacturers would have to face. Finally, the idea of mooring airships to a building is extremely dangerous. Marcia Amidon Lüsted's "@ CAPS2 Mast" gives a great third reason why airships are not safe, "The fear that the wind would blow airships on the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area, which would pierce the hull of the airship. " If disaster struck, many lives would have been lost or seriously injured. Finally, the builders and the architect would find it very difficult to convince senior government officials to allow aerial ships to dock on the Empire State Building, as evil certainly trumps good.

There are a lot of obstacles in trying to get a feel for a building. They had to make sure that the structure of the building was able to withstand the strong winds it was going to experience. In addition, they also had to make sure that the roof was secure enough for the airships to dock on it without injuring anyone or the building.  

<START>

 

In "The Mooring Mask" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, In order to allow airships to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles. First of all, "the absence of a suitable landing zone". They had to make room for the huge airships to land. Second, “ add stress to the building frame ”. They had to strengthen the structure of the building so that it did not break. Finally, "the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing" if they wanted to be able to do this job, they had to find a way to calm the wind near the tower. Thus, in "The Mooring Mask" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, in order to allow airships to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles.        

<START>

 

In the passage "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in trying to allow the airships to dock there are highlighted. The author brings our "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". The climate and winds were constantly changing at the height of the building. The rear of the airships would then pivot, which could very well be dangerous. Additionally, manufacturers had to take into account that "most airships ... use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." The Empire State Building is in the middle of New York, a very populous state. The explosion of an airship at the top of the Building would be very dangerous & would kill many people. The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many challenges in trying to get airships to dock.       

<START>

 

While the Empire State Building was being built to allow airships, or airships, to dock there, workers encountered several problems in trying to get there. The first of these obstacles to the workers was the frame of the building. The building had to be strong enough for the airship to dock with the high winds constantly pushing the airship in different directions. Without the good work of the frame, it would be extremely dangerous to tie up. The next obstacle to docking was the hydrogen gas fueling the airships. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and there have been other accidents with hydrogen airships. The workers realized that an accident with explosive airships would be very dangerous in a "densely populated area". The last obstacle encountered by the workers was the strong wind currents at this altitude. The winds were so strong that the airships couldn't even get close enough to dock. Workers suggested that making the airship heavier would result in weights, but since the weights "would be hung over pedestrians on the street", this "was neither practical nor safe". Trying to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea. Over time, the obstacles preventing this became too great and ultimately ended the idea.           

<START>

 

Based on the snippet, there are a few key hurdles that builders face, one being the safety of people in airships and the people below them, and two being nature itself. Personal safety was critical because if something was not secure then it would not be used. There were a lot of things that could go wrong, like the airship hitting an arrow and killing everyone below. The biggest obstacle was nature. If the airship was attached to the mooring mast, it would wrap around the building, or it would be difficult to get to the mooring because of the wind. Overall, the mooring mast was not a practical idea. It was just something designed to compete with the @ CAPS1 building, and was not designed with safety aspects in mind.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. An important issue was the mooring mast. According to @ ORGANIZATION2, "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." (paragraph @ NUM1) Another problem would be the charge of the airship. "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." (para. @ NUM1) One of the main things architects forgot to consider was the framing of buildings. “ The Empire State Building's steel frame should be modified and reinforced to accommodate this new situation. (Para. @ NUM1) The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow the airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was the lack of a suitable landing area ; "They were as long as a thousand feet, the same length as four city blocks in New York City." Another obstacle was the weight of a mooring mast. "The Empire State Building's steel framing would have to be altered and strengthened," meaning they would have to modify the entire frame to support the weight of the mooring mast which would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Safety was also an issue. Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a heavily populated area like downtown New York City, the accident would be much worse. Another problem was the fact that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts." Because of the wind, the airship would pivot around the mooring mast.

allowing airships was going to be the new form of transportation in the 1920s. There were a lot of issues with having a mooring dock above the Empire State Building. One of the main problems was that it was flammable. The helium and hydrogen gas that lifted the airships. If there was the smallest spark, the entire airship would ignite in a second. For example, the German Hindenburg Zeppelin that exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937. So if this had happened in a more densely populated area like downtown New York, it would have been a lot worse. Another problem with airships was the wind. If there were strong drafts, the airship would pivot around the mooring mast when it was moored. it is also weighed down by lead by lead weights. If it's on pedestrians, it's not safe.

According to the excerpt from Marcia Amidon Lüsted's Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles during the construction of the mooring mast. For example, there was actually a law that prohibited exactly what the builders wanted. The law stipulated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. The Empire State Building's mooring mast would directly violate this law when ships dock. Another problem that manufacturers faced was the danger surrounding airships that would dock there. Airships, called airships, were like giant balloons and could burst if they hit something sharp enough. The Empire State Building was surrounded by other extremely tall buildings and most of them had long spiers at the top. Therefore, if the airship hits any of these arrows, it could burst and collapse to the ground. This presented another problem. If an airship had exploded in New York City, it could have killed large numbers of people not only inside, but on the ground. During construction, the Hindenburg crashed into the fields, killing all of its passengers. The builders thought what the consequences would be if this happened in the city. It was the last straw for the builders as they gave up on their lofty goal, because of too many problems.

According to the expert, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. The fabric they use for the airships is very light. "Cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make it lighter than hair. They also imply that the architects did not put enough effort into solving the problems." The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose ... "

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered some obstacles while trying to have an airship dock. The wharf would break the laws. The wharf would also be a danger to people below. It would also put a lot of stress on the frame of the building. "

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's excerpt "The Mooring @ CAPS1", the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles while trying to allow the airships to dock. One obstacle was the terrible winds. In the excerpt, he indicates how bad the winds are. An airship was going to try to moor there, the US Navy Los Angeles airship could not get close enough because of the very strong winds. The captain was concerned that the wind would push the airship into a sharp arrow at one of the buildings in the area and pierce the hull of the airship. Another reason was that there was already a law banning airships flying low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any airship to attach to or even approach the building. The last and final hurdle they faced was the fear of crashing. Since most airships from outside the country used hydrogen rather than helium, this was dangerous because hydrogen is highly flammable. They heard about the airship fire in New Jersey, they realize how much worse an accident like this would be in such a densely populated area like downtown New York. And these are the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The huge gusts of wind. The law. And don't forget what's going on with airship crashes in the New York City area.

When constructing a building, workers will face difficult obstacles, especially when it comes to constructing the Empire State Building. In attempting to allow airships to dock there, Al Smith and other architectural builders encountered many problems. As stated in paragraph @ NUM1, airships could not dock with the Empire State Building because there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Also, as noted in paragraph @ NUM2, the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong air currents. These two obstacles were the reasons for the failure of the mooring mast. The builders failed to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building.     

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to license airships. The first problem was the airship material. The airships "were actually huge steel-framed balloons with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium making them lighter than air." The first problem is that its material could be shattered if it managed to fly into a sharp area of the building, and the "strong drafts" didn't help. Since airships could not be ballasted at the Empire State Building, it would be dangerous to have them " hang over pedestrians in the street ". Another obstacle was the fact that the airships were filled with hydrogen. Although airships in the United States were filled with hydrogen and helium, "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable ”. With these obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships there, the theory did not work in reality.         

<START>

 

Although thousands of dollars and countless hours were spent on the mooring mast, certain obstacles prevented airships from docking atop the Empire State Building for safety reasons. First, these airships were not safe to fly over populated areas. Some contained highly flammable hydrogen gas. Also, a German airship called "Hindenburg" caught fire in New Jersey. As stated in paragraph @ NUM1, "The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area like downtown New York ". The winds atop the Empire State Building were fierce. It is stated in paragraph four of adolescence, “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly turning. " It would not be prudent to moor a blimp on the Empire State Building.         

<START>

 

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast," many obstacles created problems for the builders of the Empire State Building and their goal of allowing airships to dock there. The first hurdle that came to the builder's mind was that they "couldn't just drop a mooring mast over the flat roof of the Empire State Building", (paragraph @ NUM1) as it would damage the building with the amount of pressure pulling on the structure. The second problem that architects faced was security. Events in the past such as Hindenburg were caused by the use of "hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable ... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how the accident could have been. be worse ". The next problem that arose was nature itself, like the dangerous winds. An occurrence where "the US Navy airship, Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to moor due to high winds." @ CAPS1 there were legal issues and the current law prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas making them illegal.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced the problem of how to keep the back of the airship from swaying in the wind. They could not solve this problem, as we see in paragraph @ NUM1 where it is written: "Even if the derigible were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the vessel would pivot around and around the mooring mast . " Another issue with mooring airships to the Empire State Building was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over populated areas. There is proof of this in the @ NUM2 paragraph where it says "The other practical reason airships couldn't dock at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low at- above urban areas. " Another problem with mooring airships on the Empire State was that it was difficult for pilots to moor their ships on the mooring. An example of this is in the @ NUM2 paragraph where it says "The US Navy Los Angeles airship approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to moor due to strong winds. "

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The obstacles they faced were the solidity of the framework, the safety of the airships, nature @ CAPS1 and a law. The first obstacle, the frame, was not too difficult to overcome, it cost @ MONEY1 to reinforce it in order to support the mast and an airship. The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable hydrogen gas which is used in airships. This access could have been much worse if it had occurred over a densely populated area like New York. The third obstacle was nature @ CAPS1, the strong air currents at the top of the Empire State Building made it almost impossible to tie up an airship to the mast. By using LED weights to weigh down the rear of the airship, it would not be practical or safe to hang over pedestrians. The latest hurdle faced by manufacturers was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. It would even make any attempt at mooring to the mast illegal.

While attempting to allow airships to dock on the mooring mast, the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. One problem they encountered was the use of hydrogen in airships rather than the use of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and actually caused the destruction of an airship by fire. In addition, the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong air currents, making it difficult for an airship to stop rotating - a danger to the safety of pedestrians below. Finally, it was illegal for an airplane of any kind to fly so low over urban areas. At first, the idea of the mooring mast was popular, but in the end it posed too many problems and turned out to be impractical.

In the 1930s, the world was changing and new technologies were coming of age. One of those technologies was the airship and some people thought about expanding its use. One of those ideas was the morning pole on the Empire State Building. It was a great idea, but the things going against it made it impossible. A major issue was safety, considering it was 1,250 feet tall. “Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If this thing caught fire, everyone inside would burn or sink into it. the ground and would kill everyone under it. Another huge issue was the winds and the ease of pushing it out of Corsica. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. These winds made it simply impossible for that to happen. One issue that should have been looked at from the start was the law. "The other practical reason airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas." @ CAPS1 this morning Mast was a fantastic idea, there was a lot of stuff standing in its way.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, describes the complicated obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was competition. “The tallest building in the world was expected to be even taller than the new Chrysler Building,” (@ CAPS1 1). “Al Smith realized he was on the verge of losing the title of tallest building in the world” (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). There was a competition for the tallest building between the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Another obstacle, security and airships. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurts, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over an area. densely populated like downtown New York. " (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2). The owner did not want to risk an accident that would cost people's lives, it would have given them a bad reputation. The obstacles the builders went through was a positive thing, it made them @ CAPS2 and opened their eyes.

There are many obstacles that must be encountered due to the mooring of airships to the Empire State Building. First, "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". This means that the winds at the top of the building were strong and the airship will pivot around the mooring mast, if it is attached. Further, "The other practical reason why airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to fly too low over urban areas. tie up to the building or even approach areas. " This shows that there was no point in thinking that ships could dock with the State Building because there is a clear law against it. There are still many hurdles you need to overcome on any project.     

<START>

 

According to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, three main obstacles prevented the Empire State Building's mooring mast from being used as intended. The first problem was that it lacked security. Airships are highly flammable machines when used with hydrogen, and a fire in New York would be tragic. Another obstacle the mooring mast encountered was @ CAPS1 Nature. The mooring was designed to attach to airships with an electric winch, allowing the airships to move freely. When the winds of @ ORGANIZATION3 were to blow on this situation, the diridles "swung around and around the mask" (@ CAPS2 @ NUM1), which would put stress on the building frame and lead to a very dangerous environment. The last reason was that there was a law created that declared it illegal for a ship to fly too close to urban areas for safety reasons, leaving the entire mooring mast unusable.       

<START>

 

According to the snippet, the obstacles that the builders faced while trying to build the Empire State Building's airship dock were : finding a way to make this building taller than the Chrysler Building, designing the mast and @ CAPS1 reality. Al Smith needed a way to make a building taller than the Chrysler Building. He had the idea of putting a mooring mast on the building. The idea sounded great. When designing the mast, the architects realized that they couldn't just place the mast right above the building. They should change the foundations. After changing the structure of the building, construction continued as planned. Two months later the mast was finished, but the architects were forgetting that most airships use hydrogen which is highly flammable. All the work of the architects was wasted because the mooring mast was never used.         

<START>

 

There are always challenges when you try something innovative. There are barriers like getting approval, getting support, and you also need to be structurally sound. Al Smith and the rest of those architects faced it all. In the 1920s, airships were meant to be the future of travel. Al Smith wanted to be able to dock an airship atop the Empire State Building. Besides getting people to agree to the plan, he had other issues. The wind is very strong at this altitude. Airships weren't supposed to fly so close to town that it's dangerous and some were very flammable. In conclusion There were too many important obstacles to overcome.        

<START>

 

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. "Hydrogen is highly flammable." The airships ran on hydrogen rather than helium and if it ever caught fire there would be pedestrians everywhere below who would be in grave danger. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." Because the airship would be moored so high with little rear control, high winds would be a huge problem. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." If an airship were to dock there, it would also be breaking the laws. "... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." Builders have many more obstacles to docking airships than just architectural ones.

The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were that they had to build a building taller and taller. They also struggled to build it, so workers had to save the dates. Another obstacle that they struggled with is the mast. “The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined to never serve its purpose. The workers also weren't planning on having these many obstacles, they just wanted to get the job done.

The obstacles that the empire state builders faced were trying to ensure that the building did not collapse.

<START>

 

Some issues that the builders faced when constructing the mast on top of the building were that they could not just drop the mast onto the flat roof of the building, as the wind would then put stress on the frame as the airships could be suspended there. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified and reinforced to make the mast. The cost of these changes was another issue for both of them.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. The main obstacle was that the builders couldn't @ CAPS1 put the mooring mast on the Empire State Building because it had a flat roof. The mooring mast would exert pressure on the structure of the building. To overcome this obstacle, the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame. Over sixty thousand dollars were spent on frame modifications. The biggest obstacle, however, was nature, and there was nothing the builders could do about it. The strong air currents constantly moved the winds to the top of the building. In open fields, airships could be ballasted at the rear using LED weights, but with pedestrians around it would not be practical or safe. Without being ballasted, the airships would pivot.        

<START>

 

During the construction of the Empire State Building, builders encountered multiple obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock at the top of @ CAPS1. One of the hurdles that the builders faced was the modifications : “ The stress of the load of airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation. » With this obstacle, entrepreneurs would need to strengthen the @ CAPS1 of the framework and the foundation. And the barrier, as the excerpt goes, is that "most airships from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which is flammable." @ CAPS2 that hydrogen is flammable, it wouldn't be good if an airship exploded in the streets of New York. These are the obstacles encountered by contractors during the construction of the Empire State Building.

In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The reason builders encountered obstacles was that "architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." An example is "A thousand foot airship, moored to the top of the building held by a single tether, would add stress to the building frame." The stress of the airship moor would weaken and weaken the framework of the buildings. This is just one obstacle that manufacturers have faced, but there are many more.

The builders faced many obstacles in constructing the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that Al Smith was competing with the Chrysler Building. Which was forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. This led Smith to have the State Building reached at a height of 1,250 feet. This leads to another obstacle, he wanted to add a mooring mast at its top to moor the new airships. It didn't work due to the lack of landing space. A thousand foot airship moored at the top of the building held by a single tether cable, would put stress on the structure of the building. In conclusion, I have just explained the obstacles of the Empire State Building.

While constructing the Empire State Building, architects faced many obstacles when the decision was made to use the Empire State Building for speaking, charging, and refueling airships. How to tie up an airship to the side of a building was one of the biggest concerns, but the amount of stress it would cause was even more of a concern. But the biggest obstacle to this project was the wind, nature itself. There were concerns that the wind would blow the airship into a nearby building, and tying up the airship was not an option for safety reasons. Due to the architect's inability to overcome these obstacles, the Empire State Building was never used for its original purpose.           

<START>

 

The first obstacle was their expanded use in New York was the appropriate landing zone lake. Because some were up to a thousand feet long, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The second was that airships contained hydrogen and the hydrogen was highly flammable. And they realized how the worst accident could have been if it had happened in New York City, because that's where they were. They had to rethink their plan. And another was that the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts.    

<START>

 

“The biggest obstacle was nature itself.” This was a huge problem for the mooring masts as they couldn't get close enough to the building to land. The winds were too strong. Second, there was an "existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas". which meant that because there were so many people in a small area of downtown New York, it was too dangerous for airships and other planes to be that low. Finally, airships from outside the state used hydrogen rather than helium " hydrogen is highly flammable " idea. Obstacles, which were noticed too late; prior to construction, which is why airships are not allowed to land on the Empire State Building to this day.

The obstacles that had to be overcome, to create the idea of a mooring platform above what was to be heralded as " the tallest building ", were going to be difficult. Steps taken to bring this idea to life began with expert consultation. They made tours of the equipment and docking operations at @ ORGANIZATION1 in New Jersey. When it was time to start construction, the question of how much strain the building would absorb from the mass of airships became an issue. They modified the framework of the buildings to adapt to the new situation. They also designed a stainless steel tower with a recessed design that mimicked the general shape of the building. over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to achieve the goal of "The Mooring Mast"

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was that many airships outside of @ LOCATION4 use hydrogen rather than helium.

" @ CAPS1 can only imagine how tragic and chaotic that would have been. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving towards strong air currents. It would have meant that these airships could have been swept back. In conclusion, there were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there.

In paragraph @ NUM1 it says: "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was never intended to serve its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was built." These reasons are one which is due to flammable gases, a second is due to nature itself, and the last is an already existing law. As stated in paragraph @ NUM1, "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium." @ CAPS1 how flammable hydrogen is, they didn't want it over a heavily populated area. The @ NUM3 paragraph now reads : “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. » @ CAPS2 the airship would not be stable enough. Finally, I said in paragraph @ NUM4. "There was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to attach to the building or even approach the area." @ CAPS3, there was never a chance that an airship could dock there, as shown above.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. Manufacturers had to pay attention to safety, which played a big role with airships. Many airships from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, they wouldn't want the city destroyed and risk a massive fire. Another problem was nature itself. There were strong drafts above the building and would not pose a hazard to local New York pedestrians. The last hurdle that builders encountered in trying to pursue the airship idea was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. They would even break the law to allow it even in the building area, with so many problems occurring in the development of the airship blueprint, the idea of using them quietly faded away.

In the extract "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building come up against obstacles in an attempt to allow the airships to dock there. The main obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Airships need a large area to land. Al Smith said to add a mooring mast to the top of the building and that would allow an airship to land for several hours. During landing time, the airship can do "refueling or service, and let passengers get on and off." Passengers could safely descend and board the airship by descending a gangway to the open platform. Architects struggled to put a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building because they feared the airship's load and wind pressure would transmit. Airships had safety concerns, most airships use hydrogen instead of helium, but hydrogen was highly flammable. The biggest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature itself, the winds were strong due to the strong air currents and it would not be safe for airships. The practical reason airships weren't allowed to dock at @ ORGANIZATION2 was the Airship Flying Too Low Act. The idea of airship was given to airplanes. Obstacles encountered by the builders of @ ORGANIZATION3 when attempting to allow airships to dock there have been resolved.           

<START>

 

According to the excerpt, workers faced many obstacles while trying to allow the airships to dock there. In paragraph @ NUM1, the architects say "they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building." The reason is that the top of the roof is held by a single cable tie. The effect of landing something so heavy on the roof would add stress to the frame of the building. In order to enable airships there they would need to reinforce and modify the framework of the buildings, it would cost at least more than @ MONEY1. Rather than doing this, the architects designed a glass, chrome and stainless steel tower that was @ CAPS1 from the inside. This would " raise a conical roof which would house the mooring arm ." -paragraph @ NUM2. Elevators are also said to be inside to help passengers board the airships.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in its construction. . They said the Empire State Building's frame should be altered and strengthened to correct the situation. Another obstacle was that they couldn't have a rope holding the mooring mast because the airships wouldn't hold it. These are a few obstacles that the architechs threw up.   

<START>

 

Some obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the airship to dock were that the winds at that height were always changeable and difficult to land with an airship. Additionally, airships are highly flammable because they use hydrogen rather than helium. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." The project was a bad idea from the start. "The other practical reason why airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas." They even try to try it before giving up. "In December 1930, the airship @ ORGANIZATION2 Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to moor due to the high winds." It just wasn't made to do this job, so it wouldn't work.

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to dock the airships were too numerous to predict. The obstacles encountered by airships to moor there were due to many variables such as the climate, the buildings and especially the airships themselves. building itself. The surrounding urban areas consisted of sharp arrows breaking the hull, and due to the winds, this made a @ NUM2 hull breach more likely. Finally, there was a construction. Airships were made with steel frames wrapped in cotton and filled with hydrogen to make them lighter, unfortunately hydrogen being highly flammable.

In order to let the airships dock at the Empire State Building, many changes had to be made. Both builders and planners faced many obstacles. First of all, to even consider the idea, they had to " consult the experts ", which meant making visits and doing research. They had to find a "safe way to tie the airships to this mast." The next obstacle is in paragraph @ NUM1. Mooring an airship to the building would put " stress " on the structure of the building. The builders had to "modify and strengthen" the frame. One of the last hurdles they had to face was the design of the tower. The builders ultimately opted for a rocket-shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm. They were also to house the machines to winch the derigible. All in all, the builders had to make some drastic changes, spend a lot of money, all for something that wasn't even safe in the end.

When building the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. According to the excerpt, the architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on the roof of the Empire State Building. Also, having a thousand foot airship at the top of the building while being held by a single cable would add too much stress to the framing of the building. To keep the airship in place, it would cost them money. Quoting the article, "Airship load stress and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building ... the Empire State Building should be altered and strengthened ... sixty thousand dollars" worth of alterations . " Technical and financial issues made it difficult for architects to build a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow the airships to dock there. The architects had to arrange a lot of things to allow the airships to dock at the mooring mast. For example, in @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 it is written "The steel structure of the Empire State Building should be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation". Also in @ CAPS1 @ NUM2 it is written "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong drafts" . These factors and many more as to why the mooring mast was never used relate to safety and the law.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders had to face many obstacles to allow the airships to dock there. One of the reasons was security. Paragraph @ NUM1 of the excerpts explains that " most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable ." This shows us that if an accident were to happen on the mast over a densely populated area like downtown New York then the accident could turn ugly. Another reason why was nature itself. Paragraph @ NUM2 explains that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts". This was another safety concern, as airships would be suspended above pedestrians on the street. A third obstacle was that there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. As you can see the builders faced some hurdles.

The builders of the Empire State Building ran into obstacles in trying to allow the airships to dock theirs. An obstacle overcome if the airships were able to dock in the Empire State Building. Another obstacle concerned the mast. These obstacles made this construction a failure as said the author who said: "The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill its function, for reasons which should have been apparent before. let it never be built "in @ CAPS1 13.First of, @ CAPS1 five states that airships were in fact huge steel-framed balloons, with cotton cloth envelopes filled with hydrogen and helium to make the air lighter. . "@ CAPS2 how did an airship this size ever manage to land on the Empire State Building. Also @ CAPS1 new says" A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable , would add stress to the structure of the building. This @ CAPS1 also states that " Airship pressure and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below." These were just a few of the hurdles the builders had to face. The fate of the mast as in @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 says "was neither practical nor safe". The architects were blind to the potential problems with the mast. In the end, the mast was a great attempt, but it turned out to be a failure.

The architect of the new building had three big problems getting the airships to dock at the top. The first problem was the strong wind which made it extremely difficult to moor the airship. even take their hands off the levers. " Second The rear of the airship would not be attached. This problem would pose a safety risk to those descending from it." The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts. . Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast. " This effect would also make take-off difficult and dangerous. The final reason would be that it is illegal to fly planes this low over the city, already eliminating the possibility of allowing airships to dock at the top. Overall this idea was not well thought out and was rushed so this would be the first building in the world to have an airship mooring mast.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. in the excerpt "The Mooring Mask" from @ PERSON1. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building were all very competitive to make the building very tall and they didn't have a very good plan that they used. They wanted the building to have a big roof and to be useful as well, so they wanted airships moored there. If an accident happened in New York like this it would be a really big deal because there are so many people living there. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." The stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mask. They thought it would be dangerous for many reasons. This is the reason why the builders went through many obstacles

According to @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 and the architects encountered several obstacles when it came to constructing an area where airships could land, which made @ CAPS3 infeasible. One of the @ CAPS4 reasons this @ CAPS3 @ CAPS5 was due to air laws which prohibited flying too low in urban areas. Another conflict was that the winds @ CAPS6 could push the airship story into the sharp arrows of nearby buildings that would pop the airship like it was a balloon.

In the clip The Mooring Mast, I saw how the builders of the Empire State Building ran into obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. The Empire State Building was already standing and the architects decided to renovate it and make it a dock for airships. The architects working on this project had to reinforce the framework of the buildings. They were also to have women and control machines for mooring the airship. The architects also had to install lifts and housed stairs to bring passengers down to the ground floor and back up. After renovations were made to become an Empire State Building, it was 102 stories tall. After the building was completed, the owners discovered that they couldn't leave airships on the building. They would be breaking the law of low-flying airships in urban areas. So the Empire State Building was finished, but you couldn't use it as an airship.

Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would reach the new height of 1,250 feet on December 11, 1929. His plan was to build a mooring mast at the top of the building to make it equipped for modern travel. The bulders encountered three main obstacles when attempting to allow the airships to dock there. The first obstacle was security. Most of the airships outside @ LOCATION2 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. When Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire, the owners of the Empire State Building feared a much worse accident could happen in New York City. The second and biggest obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifted, which would cause the airship to swirl aft around the mast. The only way to solve this problem was to use lead weights. It was neither practical nor safe. The final hurdle was the law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal to tie airships to the building. In conclusion, the three main obstacles that manufacturers faced were safety, nature and the law.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were that there wasn't much room for them to land. Their length was the same as four blocks in New York. They also had to consult experts and take tours of the equipment. They did a lot of experiments and tests on airships. It was also dangerous to land them there. It was also bad for the environment because hydrogen is used and it is highly flammable. Airships cannot moor there because it was not stable and that makes it dangerous for people.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was to place the mooring mast at the top of the building. "Architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A thousand-foot airship mounted on top of the building ... would add stress to the framing of the building." Architects solve this problem by modifying the structure of the building. Another problem was the wind. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." @ CAPS1 there was a wire connected to the front, the airship was circling because the rear was exposed to the winds. This problem has never been resolved. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and while some were overcome others were not, resulting in the ultimate failure of the mooring mast.

Al Smith had a great idea. When he thought he was going to have an airship docking station on top of the tallest building in the world. He had great creativity and wanted to use his building to its fullest potential. Although there have been a lot of problems with this idea. One was the urban area below, many people lived in downtown New York, and it would be illegal to fly zeppelins over the populated area. Another major problem was the intense winds which were strong and made it very difficult to dock on the vessel. There were many obstacles in the way of fulfilling Al Smith's dream for the Empire State Building to dock the airships on top of the building.      

<START>

 

Some of the things they faced were security risks. Like when they said in @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 when the Hindenburg was destroyed they said "The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had happened in New York . " Another obstacle they faced, as they said in @ CAPS1 @ NUM2 was "nature itself". The winds would make an @ CAPS3 airship spin like crazy. The last issue was the law stating that airships can @ CAPS3 so low over urban towns.

In @ DATE1, airships were seen as the transport of the future. Trying to make New York City the vanguard of modern travel, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building rushed to the challenge of building a mooring mast without recognizing the obstacles that lay ahead. When the architects designed the mast, they quickly realized that the building's frame was not equipped to support the weight on the flat roof. Making those adjustments had cost the builders more time and New York more money. In addition, the workers did not take into account the wind currents. In this excerpt, the author says that "the US Navy Los Angeles airship approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to moor due to the high winds." The workers at @ CAPS1 should have considered the possible obstacles before building something as tall as a mooring mast.

Al Smith, governor of New York for four terms and leader of the construction of the Empire State Building, had a vision. His vision was to create a two hundred and fifty foot mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, not only to make it the tallest building in the world, but also to moor passengers and deliver cargo to it. using airships or airships. Unfortunately, there was a lot of @ CAPS1 facing the Empire State Building builders regarding the possibility of mooring airships on its mast. The main concerns of the builders were the materials that airships are made of, nature, and airship laws. The first hurdle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building regarding mooring airships to its mast was the materials from which the airships are made. According to the article " The Mooring Mast " from @ ORGANIZATION2, " Most airships ... used hydrogen ... highly flammable ... " Builders realized that this posed a huge threat to safety, by especially in a densely populated city. The second obstacle that builders encountered in mooring airships on their mast was nature itself. The article states, “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts ... neither practical nor @ NUM1. weather situation. The last hurdle construction workers faced was a neglected airship law. The story goes : "... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas" (@ ORGANIZATION2). law to even tie an airship to a building. In conclusion, the top three @ CAPS1 that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with regards to the possibility of mooring airships to its mast were the materials the airships are made of, nature, and airship laws. .

In this project to build a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, there were some issues. The idea of the mooring mast was to be able to moor the airships to the top of the Empire State Building + be able to get passengers up + get off the airship from + into the building. The big problem he faced was the wind speed in the air. At nearly @ NUM1 feet in the air, the wind would even whip a huge moored steel airship. When New York Governor Al Smith came up with ideas for building this mast, no one realized that after that, it was a somewhat ridiculous task. In paragraph @ NUM2 it says: "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was built." After it was deemed impossible, people began to realize that everyone was just caught up in the new modern travel idea to be realistic.

In the excerpt, it is about making the Empire State Building the tallest in New York. It was the tallest building until architects built the Chrysler Building. The Chrysler Building was 1,046 feet tall, 46 feet taller than the Empire State Building. So Al Smith realized he was going to lose his title to have the tallest building. Then he had the idea of adding a top or a hat to the building. Al Smith's idea was to add a landing point for airships or airships. Al Smith knew it wouldn't be easy, so he thought about the possible reasons why it wouldn't work. He had to design another figure capable of supporting the mass of airships. He also had to think about how the passengers would get on and off the airship. He also recalled that most airships use hydrogen instead of helium, which hydrogen is highly flammable. For example, the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lake hurst.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several problems in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was to reinforce the frame of the building. This was necessary because the additional pressure of the airship load and the wind had to be transmitted to the foundation. The existing skeleton of the building had to be modified. In fact, these modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem encountered by the builders was the construction of the mast itself. To give it a unique look, the architects fabricated the tower in glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. They had to place the machinery at the base of this tower. Manufacturers also had to ensure that it was accessible to passengers; they made sure that luggage and people could come and go from the plane. These are two of the challenges that builders face when constructing the Empire State Building. Although the mast is unused these days, the design makes this building one of the best-known buildings in the world.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. One obstacle that the builders faced was the high winds. The Empire State Building is so high that the winds were very fast and it constantly changed direction due to the strong drafts. This made docking the airships very difficult. Another obstacle was pedestrians and other surrounding buildings. Most of the balloons were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. If an airship caught fire or crashed, a lot of damage would be done to the city and its inhabitants. The structure of the building also proved to be an obstacle. The airships were so big that the building structure was in danger of breaking down and destroying the building. The final hurdle the vessel faced was the law which prohibited a vessel from tying to a vessel or even flying this low in an urban area. Although there were a few attempts, the Empire State Building was never able to have airships to dock with it.

In the snippet, there were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Problems where the airship being "held by a single cable tie, would add stress to the building frame", and wind pressure would not help either, as noted in @ CAPS1 @ NUM1. Another problem was that, as stated in @ CAPS1 @ NUM2, "most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium", ... "hydrogen is highly flammable.

In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems with their ideas. The builders believed that they would be able to create a successful landing dock for airships. Everything they did was well planned, but when it came time to test it, it didn't work. There were some issues with the idea of using the Empire State Building as a landing pad for airships. One of the reasons this one was unsuccessful is that the airships were unable to get close enough to tie up the building. to be anchored would be for a rope to be tied to something. But the balloons couldn't get near the building because the spike at the top of the building made it too difficult. If he got close to the point, he could pierce the balloon, which would not be possible because the gas holding him back would come out and the balloon would fall. There is another major reason why their plan didn't work. The other major reason would be because of the wind. the wind would become so strong that the back of the airship would sway back and forth, making it unsafe for passengers. They could not weigh it down with weights would be dangerous for pedestrians in the city @ CAPS1 a major reason why the plan to dock airships to the Empire State Building would not work.

The builders of the @ ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in order to allow airships to dock there. To begin with, a suitable landing area was missing. This was a difficult hurdle because builders had to think of a place where extremely large airships could land in a crowded place like New York City. Then it was about finding a safe way to put the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another difficult hurdle, because if the mast was just placed on top of the building it would add stress to the frame of the building which is dangerous. Last but not least was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were wings that were constantly moving due to the strong drafts. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle as the winds could constantly move and shake the airships. Additionally, if they were ballasted with lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be hung over pedestrians on the street. To allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building, builders @ ORGANIZATION1 many different obstacles.

According to the excerpt, builders encountered many problems allowing airships to dock with the Empire State Building. First, security would be a big issue. Back then, most airships used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only would the airship ignite, but the Empire State Building could also do so. Another obstacle that the builders had to face was nature. According to paragraph @ NUM1 from the read, the location of the Empire State Building has "strong drafts" with shifting winds. This problem would prevent the airship from remaining stable. Although solutions such as lead weights suspended from the rear of the airship were proposed, this only posed more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of @ ORGANIZATION2 where pedestrians could be injured. The last hurdle that the builders would have had to overcome if they continued with their plans for airships would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So in theory all plans of the builders of this concoction had to be canceled due to government law. In conclusion, many problems arose during the construction, and plans to realize the "Airship Dock" were drawn up.

First, the stress of a "thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable" was a problem. The metal frame of the building therefore had to be modified and reinforced to accommodate the airships. Then they were faced with the fact that airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and "when the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been. if it had occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast", author @ ORGANIZATION2 explains some of the obstacles that builders faced in their attempt to allow airships to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. First of all, the airships were big and heavy and needed room to land. @ ORGANIZATION2 said that "some were ... the same length as four city blocks in New York". If the builders wanted @ CAPS1 airships above the building, they would need a lot of space to build a large landing pad for a safe landing. Second, they decided they couldn't land airships on a flat roof and decided to tie up with a tether cable. The authors say "the architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast over the ... flat roof."

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to build an airship dock. One issue was security. While American airships used helium, other countries filled their airships with highly flammable helium. If an airship were to ignite in a densely populated area like New York City, the result would be fatal. Nature also caused problems with the mooring mast. The winds above the building were too strong and changeable, and could potentially destroy the airships. Finally, federal laws stipulated that an airplane could not land so close to a building. These three factors made it impossible to dock the airships to the Empire State Building.       

<START>

 

Throughout the process of building the Empire State Building with the airship dock, there were many complications. At @ CAPS1, the vessel could not simply put a mooring mast above the vessel. The roof was flat so the airship would add stress to the building. They would need @ MONEY1 to change the frame of the building. Then they realized that most airships used hydrogen rather than helium as hydrogen was highly flammable which would be dangerous. They encountered a problem with nature itself. At the top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. Even if they attached the mooring mast, the stern of the vessel would turn around and around the mooring mast. Therefore, with people all over the streets of @ CAPS2, this was neither possible nor safe. There was also a law against flying airships too low over urban areas. It all gave way to planes, so even though airships didn't work, it helped.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was that countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, if it caught fire above a city the results would be disastrous. Another obstacle was that at such a height the winds were blowing behind the airship. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle to docking airships to the Empire State Building was the law prohibiting airships from flying below a certain height above cities. All these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible.

Back in the roar of @ NUM1 and @ NUM2, New York City was a popular place that needed to adapt to ways of modernizing travel. A fashionable new form of travel was the airship or airship. Those @ ORGANIZATION2 balloons had nowhere to dock in @ ORGANIZATION2, and solving this solution was more difficult than expected. Al Smith, architect of the Empire State Building decided he could use the top of the tower as mooring mast for these airships. After adjusting the entire building to the change, Smith ran into a few problems. @ ORGANIZATION2's first problem arose when a German airship exploded in New Jersey. This let Smith know that it would be a bad idea to allow any airship @ CAPS1 nearby, as most non-US craft were filled with "hydrogen [which] is highly flammable", leaving the possibility of disaster. . Another problem was the "winds at the top of the building ... moving due to ... drafts" which would cause the airships to sway freely and dangerously in the wind. With the wind, they could crash into the towers and "be suspended over pedestrians". The @ CAPS2 valves also came into play because there was a pre-existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas, "which would make any airship activity with the Empire State Building downright illegal.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in constructing a mooring mast for airships to moor at the top of the building. The stress and pressure of a thousand foot airship moored at the top of the building was too great for the building's original framing to withstand, so they had to reinforce and strengthen the framing and base in order for the pressure to be transmitted. at the foundation of the building. Another obstacle was that most of the airships outside of @ LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. The hydrogen was much more flammable and hydrogen airships like the German airship Hindenburg were destroyed by fire and they didn't want that to happen to the people of New York. The last obstacle was the violent and changing air currents above the building. Even if the front of the airship or "mast" were attached to the mooring mast, the stern would pivot around the mooring mast. The mooring mast's many invisible obstacles made it an inconvenient mooring point for airships. In the 1930s, after planes and airships disappeared, ticketing and bagging rooms were transformed into tourist and site-visiting areas.

When the builders of the Empire State Building were building the docking station, they encountered many @ CAPS2. One of those @ CAPS2 being the drafts at the top of the building. The airship would be unable to stand still and release its passengers safely. The evidence to support this claim comes from the article itself when it says : “The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong air currents. " Another obstacle that builders faced was the law. This law prohibited airships from flying at low altitude in a populated area. Therefore, an airship attempting to dock with the Empire State Building would be breaking the law. This was explained in paragraph fifteen of the article when he said, "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area ..." @ CAPS1, he became Very dangerous to moor these airships in a populated area or near a building as there was a risk that they could ignite. Like the Hindenburg airship in 1937. The article explains that the builders realized this new threat, "... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been ..." @ CAPS2 tormented the construction of the wharf.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. Unforeseen security concerns lead to the downfall of the building's creative use. "The main reason was safety. Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (@ CAPS1). They saw some of the dangerous effects of hydrogen when the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire. “The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the crash could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area like downtown New York” (@ CAPS1) . Other problems that the builders of the building faced were those of mother nature. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts" (@ CAPS1). This made it difficult for the airship to moor safely to the mast. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast" (@ CAPS1). Not only did nature play against the builders, but so did the law. It's almost negligence on the part of the builders not to realize that they would be breaking a law by building this mooring mast. “This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area” (@ CAPS1). While the idea of an airship mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building seemed innovative and practical, it was irrelevant due to the many obstacles that obstructed the builders of the Empire State Building.

While trying to build a mast on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered all kinds of problems. The purpose of this mast was to allow airships, or airships, to dock. However, many of these issues were the effect of the airship itself. In paragraph thirteen, line @ NUM1, the author talks about some of the dangers of the airship, "Most airships ... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." Another obstacle is the location. It was thought to be very dangerous because if an airship caught fire, it would land in the middle of New York City, not in a distant cornfield. Finally, the winds frequently changed this high. It was a reckless decision to dock in this area if the airship was blown around the building.

Al Smith was a guy who had the idea to build the tallest building in the world, and he didn't give up. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building, the height of the goal would reach 1,250 feet. He also wanted transportation to involve. The obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were the lack of a landing pad. Al Smith figured he could add a mooring mast to the top of the building and allow airships to dock there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers get on and off. weather. Airships moored in open airstrips could weigh in, where they could hang above pedestrians on the street. It was also an existing one. airship law, flying too low over urban areas.

Throughout their lives, many people plan to craft or build an amazing item, but have to accomplish amazing feats to achieve it. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's “ The Mooring Mast ”, @ ORGANIZATION1 plans to build the tallest building in the world, but in order to do that he has to overcome many obstacles that you and I might never have thought of. On December 11, 1929, the Empire State Building was proclaimed the tallest building in the world. In constructing this huge building, there were many obstacles. One of the obstacles was to allow airships to dock on the building. "The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong drafts." This quote shows that it can be dangerous to let airships dock because of the winds. Another quote that shows an obstacle to docking airships to the Empire State Building is "an existing law against airships flying low over urban areas." This quote shows that it might be illegal to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. In life we overcome great obstacles, but sometimes we cannot overcome the obstacles we face.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast, he describes the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. In paragraph @ NUM1, they described that the main reason was safety, as most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. In paragraph @ NUM2 they also describe another obstacle was nature itself because the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. Even airships moored in open airstrips could be weighed down in the rear with lead weights, which could be hazardous to pedestrians. In paragraph @ NUM3, they describe another reason why dirigibles couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law prohibited a vessel from mooring to the vessel or even approaching the area. Here are some examples of the obstacles that the Empire State Building builders encountered in allowing airships to dock there.

The Empire State Building encountered obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Some obstacles seriously affected the attempt to build the airship wharf. For example, the Empire State Building is located in a very dense urban area. Back then, most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. The main difference between the two was that hydrogen is more flammable than helium. So if the hydrogen in the airship were to ignite, then a castistrophic fire would occur. The effects could be as devastating as the Hindenburg which ignited over Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The result of the Hindenburg accident forced architects and engineers to seek a safer alternative solution. . Explosive gases were not the only problem, however. Strong, gusty winds were present atop the Empire State Building. If the winds were to blow over a heading of the mooring airship, the result would be fatal. If airships catch fire or blow out of the race, ground level pedestrians could be injured.

Airships, or airships, were considered the means of transportation of the future. In order to add height while serving a purpose, the architects of the Empire State Building decided to build a mooring mast over the building to accommodate the "pioneers of aviation." @ CAPS1 the mast was built and gave the building the desired height, its use as a docking station for airships would never be fulfilled. Obstacles encountered by builders in attempting to allow airships to dock included the height of the building, wind speed, and the safety of civilians. The height of the building was 1,250 feet, causing violent changes in air currents. "The wind at the top of the building was constantly changing due to the strong air currents. Even if the airships were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast." The airships also used hydrogen as fuel and lead weights to be weighed down; however, using the mast, hydrogen and the use of lead weights posed a safety hazard to civilians below. The builders had created the mooring mast to moor the airships, but the idea caused problems and was never realized.

There were many obstacles to attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that the airship suspended by a tether cable would add stress to the structure of the building. This stress would cause the foundations of buildings to crack. This obstacle forced the architects to reinforce the foundations, which cost them more than sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another hurdle was that they had to create another floor that would be used for passengers and let the elevators take passengers to the eighty-sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be. These observation areas were to serve as a boarding area for airship passengers. Once that was done, they then completed the roof before the mooring mast framing could take place. Another obstacle was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were always changing, and airships, which usually landed in open fields, could be ballasted with lead weights, but could not be used in the Empire State. Building, where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the streets. Another obstacle was that there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for an airship to dock or even approach the Empire State Building. All these many obstacles led to the ideas of airships and mooring mast, because airships were gone.

The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow airships to dock there. They have tried many different ways of approaching this idea. There were a few different theories on what would be best and how to develop the mooring mast by Al Smith and John Tauranac. Each man had a different opinion of how the whole structure was to become. The architects designed a new tower of glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel that stretched from the bottom to the top of the Empire State Building. This structure helped support the mooring are, where the airships were moored. But the fate of the Mast was not so bright. "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was never intended to serve its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever built." This statement is absolutely true. And shows that the work of architects has never been fully planned and over looked for the mast to be durable.

According to the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to get the airship to dock there were fallow land. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts. There was nothing the airship could do, even if it was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast.

The installation of a mooring mass above the Empire State Building would have made the building, as well as New York City, incredibly important to modern travel in the 1930s. Alas, there were many difficult obstacles. made the mast impossible to finish. First, to bring the mast to the top, the frame of the building had to be reinforced and reinforced, which was laborious and expensive. Second, builders have had to deal with the possibility of airships exploding. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. With strong and constantly changing winds at the top of the building, the zeppelin swayed and swiveled around the mast, making it difficult and dangerous to unload passengers. With high winds, the zeppelin could even loosen from its mooring and fall into the city below, potentially killing hundreds of people. Finally, the manufacturers ignored the law that prohibited airships from flying too close to urban areas. This law prohibited any airship from approaching the Empire State Building, let alone docking there. The idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a fantastic idea, albeit doomed from the start.

@ ORGANIZATION2's Mooring Mast is primarily for builders and architects trying to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building in New York City. In the beginning, the main idea of the mooring mast was to allow airships to dock at the mooring mast to drop off and bring in passengers. The mooring mast was necessary because "The architects could not just lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of @ ORGANIZATION1. A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to structural buildings. Airship load stresses and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. (paragraph @ NUM1). One of the reasons this plan did not work is that it was not safe because the hydrogen used by airships is highly flammable (and this may cause a serious fire). in addition, it was windy, the blimps could be pushed by the wind. To stop this they lead weights for weighing, but they can not use them with all persons and other buildings around. Moreover, airships could not fly too low over such areas. Although the plan did not work it was better for everyone to be safe.        

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock with it, both during construction and after. When creating the mooring mast, the architects had to figure out how to place it on top of the building, as the stress of load and wind pressure would add stress to the building frame ; instead, they had to transmit load and pressure to the foundation, modifying and strengthening the steel framing of the building. The builders also wanted the mast to look good, as the tower needed to be shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel, rising to a conical roof and lit from within. After the creation of the mooring mast, other difficulties arose. Mast safety was an issue, as airships using hydrogen outside the United States were highly flammable, and the German airship Hindenburg caught fire as a result. Winds at the top of the building also created a hazard, as they constantly moved away from strong drafts. The airships pivoteraient around the mooring mast Another obstacle was the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. It would therefore be illegal for an airship to tie up to the building or even fly too close to the area.             

<START>

 

In "The Mooring Mast", by @ ORGANIZATION2, he revealed many issues with mooring airships atop the Empire State Building. Al Smith, the architect working on the Empire State Building, believed the mooring mast would go up without a problem. The architects soon realized that the mooring mast would add stress to the framing of the buildings and cost @ MONEY1 in modifications. After seeing what happened to the German airship "Hindenburg" at Lakehurst, the architects soon realized that having airships filled with highly flammable hydrogen over the densely populated city of New York was no big deal. good idea. Nature itself would not allow the construction of the mooring mass. There were such strong drafts at the elevation of one thousand fifty feet @ ORGANIZATION1 that made the architects aware that this idea could not be sustained. The airship would rotate because it could not be weighed down like in open landing fields. They couldn't use these weights because having weights suspended over pedestrians' heads was neither practical nor safe. There is also a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to attempt to dock an airship atop the Empire State Building. Ultimately, the idea of having airships docked at the Empire State Building and becoming the new modern form of transportation was quickly scrapped.         

<START>

 

while trying to let the airships dock with the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. For one thing, there wasn't much room for them in New York City, which ultimately made things more difficult. In addition, they were forced to work more in the building by reinforcing and modifying the steel frame of it to adapt to the new situation. A lot of money has been spent on these new renovations, over sixty thousand dollars. This was done primarily to reduce the stress on the building frame. But overall, they managed to do it all and work their way through these tricky obstacles.     

<START>

 

Al Smith had an ambitious plan to put his Empire State Building above New York City. He envisioned the skyscraper as an airship port and a future transportation hub. However, the technical limitations ultimately proved insurmountable. First, the airships had to face docking in an urban area. Airships would normally drop lead weights to secure their landings, but that wouldn't be practical when people were in the streets below. Wind was also a major problem as it made the airship difficult to stabilize in the air. Wind would be increasingly problematic in the city, because if an airship struck a building, it would pierce and fall in New York City. None of the airships that tried to dock could because of the wind and other buildings. As elegant as the landing in the middle of @ LOCATION1 would have been, the safety issue could not be resolved and there were too many people around to risk it.

the obstacles faced by the builder of the Empire State Building were ... when they planned to build a mask for airships. When they first tried to build it, they realized that the structure of the Empire State Building could not contain the mask. The Empire State Building was to wear both the mask and the airships. Then at the end of the story, we realized that there was no way to do it. He was one of the obsessives.

Whenever architectural work is carried out, one should think in advance about the potential consequences. In "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in an attempt to allow the airships to dock there. Airships are made of dangerous chemicals and, "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium," and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A possibility of flames could result in the destruction of a building and, even worse, a destroyed city. Although fires were a problem to consider, "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". This building is extremely high in the sky so the winds are getting quite strong. If an airship was attached to the mast, the stern of the ship would continuously pivot and deteriorate the fabric of the aircraft. A mooring mast just wasn't a brilliant idea for a big city like New York. The population was too large and the area was too crowded. The obstacles encountered by the architects were serious and they helped the team kill the idea of allowing airships to dock at the Empire State Building.         

<START>

 

Many obstacles were encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building as stated in the article "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2. These barriers included security and availability. The idea of being able to dock an airship to a building in the middle of a densely populated city like New York City was extremely dangerous between explosive hydrogen tendencies and uncontrollable winds. With the winds, the airship would continuously move around the mast, creating an extremely dangerous environment for all. Availability would also be questioned, in paragraph fifteen @ ORGANIZATION2 talks about the US Navy Los Angeles airship @ CAPS1 docked due to the unavailable route of the entire save. This unavailability made travel to the mooring mast almost impossible. Obstacles in the mooring mast include availability and safety.      

<START>

 

There are a lot of obstacles with the mooring of dirigibes, for example in the text he was talking about if the accident had taken place on @ CAPS1 it would have been a lot worse because New York is a populated city another obstacle was the height as mentioned in the text and anything can happen at this height, so they are obstacles to the mooring of dirigibes.

In the article, @ ORGANIZATION1's The Mooring Mast was determined to make the Empire State Building the tallest building. To make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler Building, Smith decided to create a “ mooring mast ” where airships could land and become “ the transport of the future ”. However, the airships never landed, as there were many obstacles to landing an airship on the Empire State Building. Many airships from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and because the Empire State Building is in New York City, it would be dangerous for a hydrogen-filled airship to land in a densely populated area, like New York City. Another obstacle encountered is the weather at the top of the Empire State Building. The winds are much stronger than in the streets. If the airship could land, the winds would blow the airship all around and uncontrollably. Finally, it is illegal to have an airship flying too low to the ground and near people. It would be against the law to land an airship on the mast. There were too many obstacles for Al Smith's idea to come true.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in constructing an airship dock. They couldn't just place a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. The thousand-foot airship held by a single cable would make the setting very unstable. With the weight of the airship and the pressure of the wind, it should pass eleven hundred feet, where the foundation is. The framework would have to be made more solid to withstand the stress that would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. In the end, the mooring mast was never made due to safety, the unpredictable nature, and the law itself. It was dangerous due to the highly flammable airships endangering the densely populated area. The winds would change steadily and violently and would be very difficult to control the airship. In addition, the law that airships flying too low over urban areas would have made it illegal. Ships would never be able to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Overall, there were too many obstacles preventing engineers from building a mooring mast.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different hurdles in trying to allow airships to land there, the most difficult being urban location, money, and weather. The urban location was a hindrance for the builders as there are laws prohibiting airships flying too low over a populated area and you cannot weigh the airship as heavy as you might if it was on the ground because the weights would be hanging over the city. The second hurdle was money as it became more and more expensive to pay for all the modifications to make the mooring mast a reality. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather, as wind and other types of storms can control the airship and make it difficult to dock with the Empire State Building. Therefore, the obstacles of urban location, money and weather made it virtually impossible to construct the mooring mast.    

<START>

 

The airships were unable to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building for obvious reasons. When construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was to have an airship landing on top of the building. There were a few caveats that the workers realized. First of all, if the airship catches fire like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot of people would be in danger because it's such a big city with massive amounts of people. Another reason they later realized was that it was too dangerous for the airship to land there due to the strong, swirling winds. If they tried to land there, but the high winds wouldn't let them, then it wouldn't be safe at all. Thus the workers of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles to allow the airships to dock there.      

<START>

 

There are things @ CAPS1 that worry some people about the airships moored there. One of them was the fact that " airships swayed in the wind as the passengers descended a gangway ." This would be dangerous because by swinging it could knock the passengers off the board and cause them to fall.

the obstacles that the builders of the state @ CAPS1 empire face. was that their extended use in @ LOCATION1 was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and allow passengers to pass. The airships were moored with an electric winch, which ascended in line from the bow of the ship, then tied it to a mast.

The main obstacle to docking airships to the Empire State Building's mooring mast was security. "Most airships ... used hydrogen ... and hydrogen is highly flammable." "The owners ... realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over downtown New York." If an accident were to happen with an airship, it would put the lives of hundreds of people in danger. This is why this idea was impractical and dangerous. Another obstacle to mooring airships to the mast of the Empire State Building was nature itself. "The winds at the top were constantly changing due to strong drafts." This would rotate the stern of the ship around the mast. Lead weights could be used, but it was neither practical nor safe when suspended over pedestrians.

The safety concerns are that the lead hangs above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe.

The Empire State Building was an incredible building without the idea of attempting to allow airships to dock there. But with this idea of this mooring mast, he raised many obstacles such as public safety. Lüsted states that "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) This statement proves that if the airship caught fire like the accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the lives of the citizens of New York would be at stake. This safety hazard is one of the builder's concerns. These archatets faced many challenges with this mooring mast idea. Including the dangerous factor of nature. Lüsted states that “ the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts. " This is extremely dangerous because airships begin to move into the building when they are moored, causing dangerous menus and putting the lives of pedestrians in danger. For this mooring idea, it's too dangerous for the public and New York City.

In the process of building the dock for airships, the builders encountered certain obstacles. The first obstacle encountered by the manufacturers was the lack of a suitable landing pad. If there was no space to land, there was no reason or way to build it. In addition, builders should renovate the entire building. After the building was built up to the 85th floor, they couldn't build the mast until the roof was finished, so it took even longer. The biggest obstacle the mast faced was nature itself, as the winds at the top were constantly changing, so there was no way for an airship to land or stay put without crashing. The latest hurdle the builders encountered was a law prohibiting airships flying too low into urban areas, which prohibited a ship from docking or even approaching the building. As you can see there were a lot of obstacles and the mast was not useful. It was a great idea. But in my opinion, it was a waste of time and money.

Obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building while attempting to allow the airships to dock there was one of them, it was very windy so it was difficult for the airships to hang on to the equipment.

In the excerpt from @ ORGANIZATION1's "The Mooring Mast", builders encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. First, there is a risk that airships coming from places outside the United States could cause a fire. @ ORGANIZATION1 states "Most airships from outside the US used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (@ CAPS1. @ NUM1). This would become a big problem as they would run the risk of other airships passing our very dense air and inadvertently causing a fire. By building a loading dock, they potentially harm downtown New York City. Second, another obstacle that would hinder the construction of the wharf is nature. The builders say that " the wind at the top of the building was constantly changing due to strong drafts" (@ CAPS1. @ NUM2). Even if they try to tie up the airships, the rear may move. the idea that the winds would be too much to handle, they mentioned alternatives like lead weights, but this will become a danger to pedestrians. Finally, there was a law that prevented any airship from flying too low. The article says "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area" (@ CAPS1. @ NUM3). the law made it extremely difficult for builders. The general idea was to land the airship on the building, and this obstacle made it a bigger problem. The idea of a wharf disappeared, it was too risky to do so. Nonetheless, @ ORGANIZATION1's excerpt, "The Mooring Mast", describes the challenges faced by builders in building a wharf.

The obstacles to docking airships to the Empire State Building were that they couldn't get fuel on top of the building. Putting a mooring mast on the roof would make it very unstable and put a lot of pressure on it. For this to happen they had to modify the roof structure which ended up costing more than @ MONEY1. After they managed to build this, they had another obstacle. He was trying to figure out how airships wouldn't move with so much wind currents. They never understood how and the idea simply disappeared.

According to the excerpt " The Mooring Mast " by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow the airships to dock there. First, the design as well as the cost of this project could run into problems. Such as " adding stress to the building frame ". If the mass interferes with the frame of the building, then changing the material of the building could cost "over sixty thousand dollars!" In addition, safety was a major consideration during the construction of the mooring mast. For example, " Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen ... and hydrogen is highly flammable ." New York is a heavily populated area, which means that when building a mooring mast, safety must be put into perspective. Finally, there were restrictions on airships flying too close to cities. As stated in the excerpt, "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas". Overall, when building the mooring mast, many builders were blind to potential issues, making the project unsuccessful.

One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Due to the strong air currents, the winds were constantly changing. The airship would be constantly in motion. They couldn't even weigh it down, because there would be people way below them, and they might fall. A second hurdle they faced was the laws against it. There were laws on airships flying too low over the city. It was even illegal for airships to enter the city. These two obstacles prevent them from using the dock for airships.

In paragraph @ NUM1, it is indicated that the use of hydrogen rather than helium should have stopped the project. Still in paragraph @ NUM2, it is stated that the biggest obstacle was nature itself.

All of these obstacles have contributed to the mooring mast being used only for show and contributing to the tallest building in the world.

In the excerpt, @ CAPS1 faced multiple problems with their theory. It took a long time for people to start realizing the reality. For example, airships had a law preventing them from reaching urban areas. They also realized that the middle finger would play a negative role. The wind would make the @ CAPS2 sway around all the moorings. They thought about getting off the back of the ship, but soon realized it was dangerous for many people below. They had heard that an @ CAPS2 in New Jersey had been destroyed by fire, due to its hydrogen, also dangerous in New York with such a population @ ORGANIZATION1. Overall, they started to realize the security concerns and how impractical it was to do all of that.

The idea of allowing airships to dock atop the Empire State Building was unrealistic as it lacked identification of possible flaws in that plane. As a new form of transportation, airships were not safe. This was found to be true when the German airship "Hindenburg" exploded in 1937. Additionally, a more significant obstacle that was not addressed during the creation of the plane was the problem of its location. In crowded New York City streets, hanging flammable airships above people is dangerous. This location is also an obstacle because of the equipment necessary for the landing of the airship: the weights. Using lead weights to bring airships down is unimaginable with the potentially dangerous situations this could create. The creators of this idea only designed this system on top of the Empire State Building to incorporate a futuristic form of transportation to make the building more unique. Empire State building builders encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock, as the concept was far beyond the capabilities of their age.       

<START>

 

Some of the hurdles that the Empire State Building builders faced were airships that use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it ignites it will cause extensive property damage. Also at 1,250 feet it is very windy. The airship would blow around the building, causing man-made stress on the building. It would be very difficult to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building.    

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. When designing the mast, the steel frame of the State Building would have to be modified and reinforced to suit this new site. made to the framing of the building, rather than constructing a utility mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within, with a recessed design that mimicked the general shape of the building itself. The mooring mast has failed. Most airships outside @ ORGANIZATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. Weather conditions, such as strong air currents, were the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mast.  

<START>

 

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building are that the architects made the Empire State Building more airship. The architects placed the thousand-foot airship atop the building which is held by the tether cable. The airship must pass through the wind pressure that was about eleven hundred feet lower. The Empire State Building's frame had to be solid and it cost over sixty thousand dollars to modify to frame the building. The architects changed the design and did something new. The architects have a difficult obstacle to the construction of the Empire State Building, and that is to make airships of it.     

<START>

 

During the construction of the airship pier for the Empire State Building, architects and builders faced many obstacles. Before the mooring mast was installed at the top of the building, it became evident that "the stress of the load of the airship ... would have been transmitted to the foundations of the building" (paragraph @ NUM1). This meant that modifications had to be made to the frame in order to support the weight. Plus, security, weather, and legal issues were right at your fingertips. Filled with flammable gas, there was always a risk of an airship catching fire, and in an urban area the damage would be extremely serious. The winds at the top of the building were also dangerous. The drafts were "violent" and "even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot" (paragraph @ NUM2). Normally the ships would be ballasted, but, again, that was not possible in a city. The last problem encountered by manufacturers was the law "against airships flying too low over urban areas" (paragraph @ NUM3). Although there was a clear law against it, two airships attempted to tie up. Both attempts were unsuccessful and it became clear that the Empire State Building would not be able to serve as a landing airship.          

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow airships to dock. For example, the building had to be cropped because its original frame could not support the weight of an airship placed on it. Additionally, the materials inside the airships are highly flammable so an accident over a densely populated urban area would have been costly / fatal. Another obstacle was the wind, as the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents, the airship would rotate and be unstable, thus making the idea of mooring the airships at the top of the empire state building. impractical and dangerous.   

<START>

 

The airships encountered problems when they tried to dock them. The first reason would be that flying such a low airship over an urban area is against the law. Even though it is against the law, they still tried it and faced more issues, such as winds. The only time they tried, they couldn't moor it because the winds are too strong.   

<START>

 

The architects and builders of the Empire State Building encountered a few issues when looking for a way to allow airships to dock there. The architects knew they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the roof of @ ORGANIZATION1 as it would be able to support it. The architects also knew that if they tied the airship to the mooring mast with a single tether cable, it would only add stress to the frame. To solve this problem, the steel frame @ ORGANIZATION1 should be modified and reinforced to support the mooring mast and airship.   

<START>

 

According to the excerpt, the airships were never able to dock at the top of the Empire State Building because @ CAPS1 was a matter of safety. The passage indicates that most airships coming from outside the United States are filled with hydrogen, which is flammable. This sparked the fire on the Hindenburg, a German-made ship, in New Jersey, and when it did, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been. it had performed in the densely populated city of New York. It was also a matter of safety as the winds at the top of the building were blowing the airship all around. Finally, there is a law prohibiting the theft of airships in low-lying urban areas so that ships cannot fly in New York City.

In the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author discusses the many obstacles that builders face in trying to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building. The first obstacle they encountered was knocking the mast down onto the flat roof of the building. This task would be easy as using a single cable to lower the mast would add a lot of stress to the building frame. Another problem they faced was nature. Strong winds would cause the airship to rotate around the mast. The biggest obstacle was security. Many airships outside of @ LOCATION2 use highly flammable helium, rather than hydrogen. Helium makes airships more likely to explode and risk many lives in New York City. Finally, the existing laws in New York @ CAPS1 the balloons to be moored. Airships were flying dangerously near urban areas. Many obstacles were encountered while attempting to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building which were mentioned in the article, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

The idea that airships could dock at such an altitude initially was insane. First of all, trying to tie a thousand foot airship to a building with just one tie adds enormous strain to the frame of the building. They were able to solve this problem, but the main problem they could not solve was mother nature. The wind speed at this height is incredibly violent and would spin the ship around and around the mooring mast. Overall, the project was doomed from the start.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was nature itself. According to the text, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents." The wind would make it difficult for the airship to get close enough to the mooring mast to tie up, and even after it was moored, the wind would cause it to continue to move around the mooring mast, making it impossible to exit. passengers. Another obstacle to docking airships to the Empire State Building is a pre-existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. In the text, it says: "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even to approach the area". This is a very black and white issue against allowing airships to dock on the Empire State Building. A final, and perhaps the biggest, obstacle to docking airships to the Empire State Building is security. In the excerpt, it is written: "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." This creates safety risks not only for the passengers and employees of the airship, but also for the densely populated area below, that is, downtown New York.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast, he describes in many ways the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they had to make a mooring mast at the top. Four-term New York Governor Al Smith said it best: “A group of engineers here in New York are trying to come up with a workable and workable arrangement, and the government people in Washington are finding a sure way. moor airships to this mast. “ Another hurdle that the builders faced was having a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held only by a single tether cable, just wasn't safe. That being said, the framing in The Empire State Building's steel would have to be altered and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars to alter. No matter how the builders built the Empire State Building, they still face nature as an obstacle. These are examples that manufacturers have encountered in attempting to allow airships to dock there.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there were many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. Some of these obstacles include poor design, nature, and lack of a landing zone. Due to Al Smith's poor design, the age of airships questioned where to land them. Nature itself was also a big obstacle. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." The wind made it difficult for the airships to land. The last obstacle was the lack of a landing pad for these huge balloons. Once Al Smith saw the opportunity to land the airships on the Empire State Building, he grabbed it.      

<START>

 

Allowing an airship to dock atop the Empire State Building would leave architects with difficult problems. Adding a thousand foot airship on top of the building would add stress to the setting. A single cable tether to the airship would not help the stress. "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." (Lüsted. @ NUM1) The framework of the building should be modified to adapt to this new situation. The main reason it was never fully built was for safety. Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire ... the owners realized how much this had happened over a densely populated area." (Lüsted. @ NUM2). This makes traveling outside of @ LOCATION1 with airships more difficult. Nature itself was a big obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The stern of the vessel will pivot around and around the mast due to the winds. "The winds at the top of the building move due to strong air currents." (Lüsted, @ NUM3). It was neither practical nor safe. These hurdles leave builders with unrealized challenges to overcome.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when trying to dock airships. One obstacle to mooring airships was the frame of the building. "Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame." This shows the amount of work that only had to be done on the building structure. Another difficulty was that most airships outside of the United States were filled with highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire at Lakehurst on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been had it happened overhead. 'a densely populated area. " @ CAPS1 how dangerous hydrogen could be. Finally, airships could be weighed down by led weights. "Using them at the Empire State Building, hanging from pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe." @ CAPS2 if the lead weights fell they could kill someone. Many difficulties were caused by trying to dock airships to the Empire State Building

And the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in order to add the mast to the building. They had to consult experts and learn all they could about the operation of the airships themselves. It took engineers in New York and officials all the way to Washington to come up with a plan of how to make it work. Just adding the mast would never work. Keeping it tied with a cable would add a ton of stress to the frame, so the whole steel frame had to be reinforced. Making the mast attractive to the eye took resources. In the end, however, all plans failed. Nature had been the biggest problem. When the currents are violent in the air around the mast, which would cause the airship to swing it dangerously. If a ship had crashed, hundreds of people in New York City would have been crushed. The project had to be scrapped, with the mast becoming a purely decorative addition.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. According to the author, "... was destined never to fulfill its purpose [the Empire State Building being a dock for airships], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever built." As the author points out, this idea posed many problems. The reasons were: security, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this from happening. The safety issue was that the airships used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact, the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. If an airship caught fire near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high that the winds at the docking station would be strong and unpredictable. This would make it difficult to land at the docking station and if it managed to attach itself, the stern of the airships would be blown away. The last problem was that there was a law prohibiting planes from being within a certain distance of a city. This law tried to prevent planes from crashing into the city. With all of these issues, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was that placing the mast on top of the Empire State Building, and then installing a giant airship there, would put a strain on the building and could remove the mast right away, which would have the effect of putting the airship down on people and buildings could cause death. and destruction. Another obstacle was the good timing of the construction. They don't want the mast finished when the whole building is only upstairs @ NUM1 of 102.

Not everyone can invent new modes of transportation for the future. Al Smith learned this the hard way when he hired a team of builders to install landing docks for airships on the Empire State Building. The team encountered many obstacles that caused problems and derailed progress. One problem that arose was that the weight of the airship added stress to the frame of the building, which was only reinforced with steel. Another issue was security. Airships coming from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. The most important problem was nature. The wind made maneuvering difficult and a strong current could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban and populated areas. While the idea of using the Empire State Building as an airdock was innovative, it was neither practical nor well thought out.

One of the obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building was "the lack of a suitable landing zone." New York City is full of buildings, and there isn't a lot of level ground to land an airship. The second hurdle for the builders was that they couldn't find a way to get the mooring mast above the building. Builders would need to fabricate a stronger building frame so that the mast could be securely on top of the building without adding stress to the frame. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. The wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and at times strong. The rear of the airship would move in the wind, even if it was attached to the building. The last reason was that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying this low over an urban area. Therefore, airships could not dock at the Empire State Building.

In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builder of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow the airship to dock there. For example " the stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below ", which describes the problem that builders would have to deal with. cope if they applied the mast and with the load of the airship and the pressure of the wind would spoil the foundation of the building. The builders therefore had to find a way not to ruin the foundations of the Empire State Building. Another example is "The steel frame of the Empire State Building should be altered and strengthened." This evidence explains that if the mast were to be placed, builders would have to reinforce the entire building so that there would be no problem with the mast.

According to The Mooring Mast excerpt, the construction of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles that the builders had to overcome. Some practical obstacles in building this landmark were the law prohibiting low-flying airships, the airship's full mooring equipment was not installed, and the biggest obstacle of all was the nature surrounding the Empire. State Building. The first hurdle that manufacturers had to overcome was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The problem with flying too low is that the airships couldn't even try to reach the building. In December 1930, an airship approached the mast, but could not get close enough, fearing that the strong winds would strike it against the sharp points. As if that wasn't a problem, the airship's mooring equipment wasn't even installed, which meant the delivered logs had to be grabbed by ropes hanging from the airship, which could get tiring. The biggest obstacle of all was nature. The winds at the top of the building were very strong due to the strong wind currents, which could cause the airship to keep moving, even when it was attached to the mast. Overall, the nature of the weather was the huge obstacle.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. The Empire State Building is located in the densely populated city of New York. Therefore, if the airship were to hang high in the air above these people, it would surely be dangerous. In addition to the safety aspect, one of the biggest obstacles was nature. Strong winds at the top of the building are always moving due to drafts, therefore airships could rotate around the mast. Finally, there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas, thus prohibiting airships from flying up to the building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered some obstacles while trying to build the mast. One problem was that there was a lot of pressure and stress that would be put on the building if an airship were to dock there. This was due to the high wind speed and the sheer size of the airship. Designers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of structural modifications to accommodate the pressure. Another obstacle was that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that airships would not even be allowed to approach the building, let alone dock with it. Eventually, these obstacles and other safety concerns, such as the hydrogen inside, the airship being highly flammable, made the idea go away.

According to The Mooring Mast article, by @ PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. Their dream of bringing New York to the forefront of modern travel never came true. First, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framing of the buildings due to the stress of airship load and wind pressure, which would add stress to the framing. However, one of the biggest hurdles that manufacturers faced was safety. Most airships use hydrogen, which is highly flammable and could be very dangerous, especially in heavily populated areas like New York City. In addition, the strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult to keep the airships stable and not pivot around the mast. Lead weights could be used to make airships moored in the field heavier, but hanging them from a building would be dangerous. Finally, the idea violated a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. All the obstacles that the builders faced made their dream of using the mooring mast for airships fail.

Some of the issues that builders faced when constructing the mooring mast for Empire State buildings were the structure, how it would be constructed, and how it could physically contain an airship without being ripped off. One of the issues was figuring out how to strengthen the mast so that the lead could be transferred to the foundation instead of tearing off the top half of the building. 

<START>

 

The concept of a mooring mast for the Empire State Building failed for various reasons. One of the major issues was that it was directly above downtown New York City, which is very densely populated. After the Hindenburg fire in New Jersey, "the owners ... realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area." top of the tower. It was the practice at the time to control the rear of the airship with lead weights, but in a civilian area it was "neither practical nor safe". on cities. Despite the two airships approaching the mooring mast, neither succeeded in allowing passengers to disembark, and the idea was "quietly abandoned" as it should have been. There were too many obstacles for him to succeed.     

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to create a mast where airships could dock. At first I thought it was a great idea, then I realized there were obstacles. The first obstacle discovered was "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium" (Lüsted). This was a problem because hydrogen is very flammable and if it caught fire in New York, thousands of people would be injured / killed. The biggest obstacle was the wind. The amount of wind was constantly changing and even if the airship was strapped in correctly, the back would continue to move, causing danger in the streets. The airship would be suspended above the pedestrians (Lüsted). Another reason was a legal reason. It was illegal to fly an airship too low over urban areas. As a result, the airship was not cleared to descend low enough to land on the building. Two tried and neither succeeded. The builders of the mooring mast were not aware of these problems at first, but later became aware of them. The Empire State Building could not be used to land an airship due to the fact that non-American airships used hydrogen, the wind flow changes frequently, and it was illegal to fly the airship low enough for it. to attach.

The architects of the mooring mast encountered many problems during the construction of the mast itself. One problem was that most airships outside the country used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium to make airships float. If one of those airships caught fire like the German airship, the Hindenburg, in New Jersey, it would put many citizens at risk. This densely populated area would be much more dangerous than a rural area of New Jersey. The last problem they faced was the law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it “illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area”. @ CAPS1 no foreign airship could dock and refuel there due to the type of gas that kept it afloat, while no airship @ CAPS2 could dock and refuel because of the law prohibiting it, the idea of a mooring mast quickly faded from the imagination of citizens and they turned to modern transport such as airplanes.

Besides the facts that mooring airships to a mooring mast on the Empire State Building would cost over @ MONEY1 and add a lot of stress to the framing of the buildings, Smith wanted to pursue his dream. Unfortunately, he couldn't do it. There are @ NUM1 big reasons. in paragraph @ NUM2, it is said that most airships are too flammable. This is because they use hydrogen rather than helium. So was the German airship Hindenburg, which was destroyed in a fire in New Jersey. the @ NUM2 paragraph says that mooring airships is just dangerous because the wind would take them to @ CAPS1 everywhere, rather than being tied to the ground and weighed down. Well, it wasn't legal. Paragraph @ NUM4 states that "... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Was another practical reason." The airships wouldn't be high enough in the air to be legal, and it was very dangerous because the pedestrians below.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in an attempt to allow the airship to dock there. In paragraph @ NUM1, he shows an obstacle that the constructors have spaced out.

In the Mooring Mast, by @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock to it. To dock, a mooring mast was needed. You couldn't just put one on top of the Empire State Building, as that would add stress to the framing of the building. In addition, the stress of the load of the airship and the pressure of the wind would add stress, requiring more modifications to the frame costing over sixty thousand dollars. The mooring mast was not completed mainly for safety reasons. After the Hindenburg fire, the owners of the Empire State Building realized a disaster it would cause if it happened in New York City. Nature was an obstacle too, with violent ever-changing air currents threatening to displace the airship, which couldn't be anchored as it could in a field. It was a risk not worth taking. Finally, a law passed earlier prevented airships from even approaching buildings on such an elevation above urban areas. These were the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems while attempting to allow airships to dock there. When it says in the passage, "couldn't just drop a mooring mast above the flat roof of the Empire State Building", it means the architects would have to modify and strengthen the building so that a "blimp of a thousand feet "lands there. . More than @ MONEY1 changes had to be made for this. Security was another issue. Airships in other countries used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, downtown New York City could have been destroyed by a large fire if an airship caught fire there. Nature itself was also a problem. “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. " That would rotate the airship, which would be dangerous. The architects came into contact with many problems.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the drops of earth to moor there were, if they had dropped the mooring mast on top of the building, they would have reinforced the frame due to wind pressure and single cable pressure. Additionally, most airships out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. Another problem was that New York is a very populous city and they didn't want to risk dropping something from the top of the building on the citizens below. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. Strong winds were constantly moving due to the strong currents. Even if it could tie the airships to the back, they would fly. They also suggest using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell, pedestrians on the street would be in great danger. The last hurdle was related to the fact that there was a law on airships flying low over urban areas.

When the builders of @ ORGANIZATION2 took on the difficult task of building a mooring mast at the top of the structure to dock the airships, they encountered various obstacles that made it difficult to carry out their plan. One of the first hurdles they faced was the fact that they couldn't just slam a long mooring mast onto the flat roof of the building. The huge airship that would be held by a cable tie would add a tremendous amount of stress to the framing and fandation of the building. The builders responded by building an even stronger framework for the building. The main problem that builders faced when trying to allow airships to dock at the top of the structure were safety concerns. Airships (apart from the @ LOCATION1) mostly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and increases the risk of fire. Since the airships would be above thousands of pedestrians in the city, the risk of an airship catching fire was far too high. On top of that, the winds atop the Empire State Building were always changeable due to the strong air currents, causing the airship to rotate around the mooring mast. While Al Smith had a grand vision to tie airships to the top of his building, the reality was that it was unrealistic, and the bulders faced too many obstacles for it to work.

As the builders attempted to create a landing zone for the airships to dock on the Empire State Building, they encountered many problems. Al @ CAPS1's idea seemed unrealistic, but with enough motivation, they were determined to try and make it happen. After so much renovation, work and ideas, they had finally realized all the potential problems. What is being built, all the problems have become apparent. The main reason they never used the dock is because they realized that it could eventually catch fire, like in New Jersey ... "The owners of the Empire State Building realized how accident could have been worse if it had taken place over a densely populated area ... ". They also warned of strong winds at the top of the tower. They were concerned that it would continually blow around the airship without a way to weigh it down. Another reason is that it is illegal to fly airships at low altitudes over urban areas. Builders encountered many obstacles while attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building.

The obstacles encountered by the builders were very dangerous and dangerous. They were the difference between them failing or succeeding. One of the problems was the strong drafts. The passage said that the winds up the building were always changing and they could easily have rotated the airship. If that had happened, they would never have been able to land. The next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians. It just wasn't an option after pedestrian safety was in jeopardy. I also had a law prohibiting airships from flying this low over urban areas. They are therefore prohibited from attaching themselves to the building or even approaching the area. It was just too dangerous to try.

Most of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock were issues that should have been thought through before construction began. At such a height, their vortex is triggered which could push the derigable in undesirable directions. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong draft." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). After the explosion of the Hindenburg, concerns of the same happening were a major security concern. "The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area like downtown New York." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2 Line 6)

Several obstacles prevented airships from docking with the Empire State Building. First, if an airship were " tied to the top of the building, held together by a single tether, it would add stress to the building frame ." The frame was not strong enough for this. But the main reason was security. It was known that most foreign airships used "hydrogen rather than helium", which is highly flammable. Things wouldn't go well if there was an incident in a populated place like New York. Additionally, the winds rotating the ship and the lead could not be used to weigh it down for safety reasons. Finally, there was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas", making it illegal for any airship to even approach a building. All of these reasons helped explain why mooring airships would encounter many obstacles.

Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire at @ LOCATION1, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been had it taken place in- above a densely populated area like downtown New York.

According to the story of Marcia Amidon Lüsted's mooring mast, builders encountered huge problems when they tried to make it accessible for airships to land. One of the main factors was the winds at such a high altitude, “ the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong air currents. " Manufacturers should not only think of a way for ships to be safe and not down, but they also need a way of supporting the weight of the airship due to the already heavy construction. These are just a few of the big issues that manufacturers faced.

Reading the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" by @ ORGANIZATION2, it is easy to see that this project faces many obstacles to overcome. The builders of the Empire State Building have their work cut out for them to allow airships to dock theirs. For example, builders need to modify and strengthen the @ ORGANIZATION1 frame and also build a mast that airships could dock with. If there were to be "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single cable, ... (@ NUM1) this would add a tremendous amount of stress to the whole building. This is why the frame steel structure of the Empire State Building needs to be reinforced, and “Over sixty thousand dollars in structural alterations had to be made.” (@ NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building are also to build a mast for them. airships. Ultimately, "... the architects who designed a tower in shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel that would be illuminated from within, with a recessed design that mimicked the general shape of the building itself. same "(@ NUM3). This idea of adding an airship mast to the Empire State Building creates a lot of work for builders. This excerpt from" The Mooring Mast "by @ ORGANIZATION2 e easily illustrates the obstacles that Empire State Building builders must overcome . From changing the frame to building the mast, these builders certainly have a significantly increased workload.

A lot went wrong in trying to get airships to dock above the Empire State Building. First, allowing this airship to dock atop the Empire State Building " would add stress to the structure of the building ." - @ CAPS1 @ NUM1. These airships are highly flammable and over a densely populated place like New York City could be very dangerous. The winds at the top of the vessel "were constantly changing due to strong air currents. Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." - @ CAPS2 @ NUM2. If lead weights were used, they could fall from the airship and kill civilians. The biggest obstacle was that a law prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. It seemed like a good idea on paper, but when it was attempted it was too unrealistic.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing pad. to solve this problem, Al Smith built a mooring mast. This would allow the airships to anchor for several hours to refuel.   

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles and challenges in getting airships docked to it, including how to tie up the mast and how to move people between the airship and the building. In order to attach the mast where the airships would land, builders could not simply secure it with the tether cable to the top of the building. It would "add stress to the structure of the building" with the combined pressure of airship load and wind pressure. Therefore, the builders had to reduce the pressure in the soil by strengthening and modifying the steel frame of the building. Another hurdle the builder faced was the challenge of transporting people and luggage from the building to an airship floating in the air. The airships would only be attached at their front ends, but the pod, where passengers climbed, was located under the airship. this meant the construction of a 'walkway to an open observation platform' from which people and luggage were to be moved @ NUM1 floor by a special elevator. While the builders of the Empire State Building encountered various obstacles while constructing the mast, one that they really should have considered was the risk and inability to moor airships to NUM2 floors above. New York.

Airships have many problems with mooring. The only problem there was was the lack of proper landing space. There was also the problem of the winds. The wind would cause a major problem if they could dock. The wind could cause it to circle around the building, causing injury to people or the airship. If it spins around the building, it could cause structural damage. The airship could also explode into flames if a spark were caused by it in the building. It could end up like the Hindenburge.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. While constructing a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the skeleton of the building. “ The steel frame of the building has been modified and reinforced ” so that the mast fits properly and remains stable and secure. Another hurdle faced by builders was to create a design that would allow airships to dock on the mast. They had to tie the front of the plane to the building, but that didn't work because, as the author states, “ Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would rotate without cease. the mooring mast. ” Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to let the airships dock there.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships (Blimps) to dock there were that there was too much risk being taken to make this mast and that was just too dangerous. I think the mast opposed too much risk because for one it would fly too low and two, if it caught fire or got struck by lightning it would explode and people would be seriously injured, OR the mast could break! but the unresolved problems of mooring aircraft to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone the final installation of the landing gear to a later date. moor air vessels to this "mast" that it is just not safe to cross at the moment !

Al Smith faced obstacles while attempting to allow the airships to tie up to the mast atop the Empire State Building. The first problem he and the architects faced was that they couldn't just put the mast above the flat roof of the building. The mast would add stress to the structure of the building. In addition, the load of airships and the wind would add stress. Another reason was security. Most airships used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In addition, the winds at the top of the building had strong currents. The winds were always changing, causing the stern of the ship to move. Finally, airships could not fly near the building because there was a law prohibiting low-flying planes over urban areas, which prohibited airships from attaching to the mast anyway.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles to allow airships to moor theirs. First, the expectations of the project were unrealistic because there was "a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas". @ CAPS1 even if they found a safe way to land with airships they would be breaking the law. Second, there were "strong drafts". When they tried to dock the airship to the building, it was unable to get close enough to land because of the wind. Finally, it was a huge security hazard. Most airships "used hydrogen instead of helium," and hydrogen is highly flammable. In a densely populated area. “ The owners of the Empire State Building realized what a [bad] accident could have been. As a result, the airships never met the expectations of future transport and they did not dock at the Empire State Building.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building ran into obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there because they needed to find a way for a mooring mast to land on it. the roof of the building, as a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building frame. The building frame should be modified and reinforced to suit the situation. It was not the only obstacle, money was also one of the problems: “More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the buildings. That's a lot of money that is used just for the framing of a building. Security was also an obstacle: “The biggest risk was that of security. Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. I think security was the biggest hurdle they encountered, because what if a hydrogen blimp exploded on top of the Empire Building. think of all the people who might get hurt because they don't call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay awake at night in their homes. They call it the city that never sleeps because it's always on the move, there are always people on the streets, and downtown New York is always full of people.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obstacles. One obstacle, for example, was the lack of a suitable landing pad. The airships were very large, some spanning @ NUM1 feet, so in a city of buildings there weren't many suitable areas to land. Another obstacle they had overcome was the fact that the city did not allow airships to be so close to rural areas. While these reasons are sufficient, the article mentions that perhaps the biggest obstacle was nature itself. “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents ” (pg. @ NUM2-paragraph @ NUM3). Overall, the idea of landing airships there was too unrealistic.        

<START>

 

The plan to dock the airships to the Empire State Building has encountered problems from its inception to its conclusion. The first problem was the original design of the building. The original design did not include an airship docking station. When the plans for the station were presented, the building was not strong enough to withstand the heavy load of an arrow and an airship. To adjust, an additional amount of @ MONEY1 was spent to ensure the building would be structurally sound when docking an airship. The following problem became imminent after the Hindenburg fire: any hydrogen-filled airship that caught fire at the Empire State Building and caused significant damage. In addition, since many airships used hydrogen, the safety risk was significant. The wind turned out to be another obstacle. The force of an airship blown away by strong winds could be too great for the structure of the building. Also, since any airship moored to the building would be a thousand feet above the ground, there was no way to anchor the airships. The fact that many tall spiers lined the skyline of @ LOCATION1 presented imminent danger to any airship attempting to dock. Finally, one of the biggest problems with building an airship docking station was the fact that the law prohibited low-flying aircraft in urban areas.

The hurdles that the Empire State Building builders faced while trying to build the dock for the airships. The architects designed a tower in shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. They had to make the Empire State Building strong enough for the wind to blow over it. In the end, they would have to face the law. These are the obstacles that manufacturers have had to face.   

<START>

 

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building were, they had predicted that airships to be attached to the mast could not because the building height was @ CAPS1 the tall airships could not keep @ CAPS2 during unloading. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1 it is written "the goodyear blim colombia, attempted a publicity stunt where he would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers", "Because the airship's complete mooring equipment had never been when seated, a worker at the top of the mooring mast should grab the bundle of logs on a rope hanging from the airship. " other obstacles were that airships outside the United States contained hydrogen instead of helium, and the hydrogen was highly flammable.

The hurdles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were two practical hurdles. Nature itself. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. Another thing was that it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. Although two airships attempted but failed, by the late 1930s the idea of using the mooring mast for airships and their passengers had quietly vanished.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The first problem was the stress on the building frame, the building required over sixty thousand dollars of alterations to solve this problem. Also, the rear of the airship would swing freely in a strong wind, this is usually solved by attaching a lead weight to the rear in fields where they usually land, but hanging it over a town is very dangerous. Another problem is the law stating that no aircraft fly too low over urban areas. Finally the airships never took. Thus, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to create an airship docking station.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. First of all, architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's frame. To avoid this, the metal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified to be reinforced and to adapt to this new situation. Second, most airships outside of @ LOCATION3 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners realized that if one of the hydrogen-powered airships caught fire like the Hindenburg at Lakehurst, @ LOCATION4, the crash could be much worse if it had happened over a densely populated area like downtown New York. The biggest obstacle that the builders faced were the strong drafts while the airship was strapped. The stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast due to the winds using lead weights to weigh down the back, where they would be suspended over pedestrians would be neither practical nor safe. The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was built.

In attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. One of the obstacles they faced was the redesign of the building. “A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's framing,” which meant they had to make changes (more than @ MONEY1 worth). Another hurdle they faced was that most airships from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. And the biggest obstacle the builders had was nature itself. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." Even if the airship was parked, the winds would shake its tail too much and that wasn't safe.

Based on this excerpt, the architects had to overcome many obstacles in order to allow the airships to dock on the Empire State Building. They first had to rethink the structure of the building because the weight of the airship would add stress. Then they added two more floors to the top of the building. They were to be the passenger boarding area. Two months after they finally cropped the building, they placed the American flag on top of the mooring mast. Soon after, they realized that proceeding with these designs was insane as it was dangerous and impractical. These are obstacles that the architects had to overcome in order for the airships to dock atop the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles encountered was trying to tie up to the top of the building. Since it was so high, there were very strong winds that the airships could be controlled. When the Los Angeles tried to dock there, she couldn't because "[she] couldn't get close enough to dock because of the high winds." In addition, "the @ CAPS1. Couldn't even take their hands off the control levers." because the airship could strike other buildings if it did. Another obstacle they faced was that New York City was densely populated and the mooring mast was surrounded by other buildings. If it caught fire like the Hindenburg, that could be a huge problem. "... how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area." The third major hurdle they faced was that there was a law against anything flying this low in cities. There was "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." This meant the airships couldn't even get close enough to moor as they were allowed to fly up to him. Since there were so many obstacles and apparent flaws in the plan, the builders should have caught it before and never built the mooring mast above the Empire State Building.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast", by @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders encountered many problems while trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the main problems was that " most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable ." This could be a serious problem if the airship caught fire and fire rained on "a densely populated area like downtown New York." Another obstacle to the creation of the mooring mast was the wind, which "moved constantly due to strong air currents". Airships should be " weighted down ... where they would be suspended over pedestrians in the street ." It would be "neither practical nor safe". because the weights could drop and kill people.

In the snippet, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the airships to dock theirs. Al Smith saw an opportunity by adding a mooring mast to the top of the building allowing airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and allowing passengers to get on and off. With this idea, the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building had to consult with experts, making tours of equipment and docking operations at the US Naval Air Station. The architects also met with the president of a newly formed airship transport company that planned to offer airship service across the Pacific Ocean. Now, as you can see, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles to allow airships to dock there.

The Empire State Building @ CAPS1 trying to get airships to dock was a lot of work. They had to spend a lot of money and it was not an easy job. They spent over sixty thousand dollars on simple modifications. I know this because in paragraph @ NUM1 it said "over sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the framing of the building. @ CAPS2 you can see they spent a lot of money on the mast of mooring. Also it was not an easy job to get everything working, there were a lot of things they had to worry about like safety issues. I know it was not an easy job because in paragraph @ NUM1 it also said “Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the flat roofs of Empire State buildings.” @ CAPS2 you can see they had to difficult to complete the mooring mast.

As they attempted to allow the airships to dock with the Empire State Building, the workers encountered many obstacles. One of the obstacles was security. While the airship, or zeppelin, was moored, its body swayed in the breeze. This poses a question of safety for passengers getting on and off. Also, there was no sure way to weigh the airship down, like when the airship lands in a field. All weights used would be suspended over pedestrians. Another obstacle was the law prohibiting airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. This law prohibited airships from docking or approaching the area. The main obstacle was nature itself. There are very strong winds atop the Empire State Building that would rock the airship. Docking at the Empire State Building was too complicated for the idea to be realized.         

<START>

 

In some cases, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as security. As stated in the reading. "The main reason was safety : the airships outside @ LOCATION1 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable." If an airship caught fire above this building, it could do a lot of damage. The next reason is that there are "laws prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas." The Empire State Building was built in the middle of downtown, if something should go wrong the airships could harm a lot of people. Another reason is because of nature. The author said, “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts. " That was the risk to airships hitting the building or another. The last reason is that "the complete airship mooring equipment had never been installed." If law and security had not been an issue, there would be no way to land an airship because they didn't have the necessary elements to land it. The obstacles created happened because they did not fully consider their plan.

The wind was an obstacle because of a strong gust of wind came he could not build materials or even workers out of the building. A second obstacle was the frame of the building because the airship was so big that at the top of the building being held by a single cable, it would add stress to the frame and make the building unstable. These are two examples of obstacles encountered by builders working on the Empire State Building @ ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow airships to dock there.

The mooring mast was a failure from the start. The builders and architects weren't looking for the problems that would be present, but only how to build as much as possible. The first major problem that construction workers faced when attempting to allow these airships to land was actually building a mast on top of the tallest building in the world. Then came the modifications necessary to improve the framing of the buildings to support the weight of the zepplins, putting the building under stress after being pushed by winds to 1,250 feet above the ground. Perhaps the most important aspect of transporting these large zepplins in densely populated areas was safety. The pedestrian safety aspect below would have been almost non-existent if the idea had been realized. For example, some of these zepplins use hydrogen to stay a loft, and if a hydrogen-filled airship burned above a city, it looked like some pretty important people below would be injured. This project seems to present too many obstacles to overcome for these architects to moor a single airship.

The Mooring Mast, by @ ORGANIZATION2 describes the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The Empire State Building rivaled the Chrysler Building for being the tallest building. Al Smith, the governor at the time, did not want to be beaten. As governor of New York, Smith added more floors to the building by transforming it into an airship dock. Over time, the building encountered more problems. Attaching a thousand foot airship to the building would add stress to the setting. "The Empire State Building's steel framing would need to be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation." The framing around the building was not durable enough to hold an "airship." The building would collapse causing other buildings to fall. Sixty thousand dollars was spent refining the frame, but in the end the building still failed. Once the frame was stable enough, other problems arose. "The main reason was safety. The airships used hydrogen, which means it's flammable." Not only did the reason for the safety of people go against the building, so did the law "The other practical reason why airships couldn't over the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships. flying too low over urban areas. " Once Al Smith realized that even the law forbade it, all the plans that went into action came to an end and the Empire State Building remained the same.

When the Empire State Building was created, it was meant to be a “pit stop” for airships, known today as airships.

It was a major safety hazard! Another problem arose. "[A] law against airships flying too low over urban areas. To go wrong with the ship, many people would be endangered.The nature of the strong wind would present the risk of piercing the airship into buildings, also endangering those below.

The obstacles that manufacturers faced in attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire were safety, nature, and American law. Safety was a major obstacle because " most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable " (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1 lin @ NUM2). Nature itself was another obstacle encountered in allowing airships to dock with the Empire State Building. “The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents” (@ CAPS1 @ NUM3 line @ NUM4). One final obstacle that would prevent airships from docking to the Empire State Building was US law. The law was against airships flying too low over urban areas.

"Most airships outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." On May 6, 1937, the German Zeppelin Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast", people trying to build airship docks found themselves with big obstacles to achieve this goal. Before adding the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, the workers have had to change the structure if not " A thousand feet airship docked at the top of the building, maintained by a single cable attachment, add the stress to the building Frame. " The mooring mast lens was really starting to drop when a problem was not realized. Safty, because most airships outside the US use hydrogen instead of oxygen, for example "a German airship named Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey because hydrogen is very flammable. Because of this, the situation could have been "how much worse this accident could have been if it had happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York". around, even if it reaches the mooring mast. The airships could use weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, "while hanging over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's story The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to get the airships to dock. One of the hurdles encountered was that having a thousand foot airship docked at the top of the building would add stress to the frame of the building. This forced the builders to modify the frame. Another hurdle that manufacturers faced was safety. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable." It would endanger the people of New York. It was a huge problem that the builders faced. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles, but safety and reconstruction were just a few of those issues.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to land there. The biggest obstacle was that posed by nature, that there was always a constant change in wind direction, so airships could not land safely. The architects believed that heavy weights could be placed at the ends of airships, but then realized that it would not be safe for pedestrians walking below. In addition, the building had to be a certain number of feet high, for the height of the airship to rule out. If it weren't for something exploding, the densely populated city of New York would be in grave danger. In theory, the airship mast was a revolutionary idea, but in reality it just wouldn't work.    

<START>

 

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the hurdles was that architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. Indeed, as it says in paragraph @ NUM1, "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." Another hurdle was getting the Empire State Building's mooring mast to perform its function. It was very difficult to get the mooring mast to fulfill its role because the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. In paragraph @ NUM2, it is stated that “ the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts. " These are the reasons why builders of the Empire State Building have faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock at the top of the building.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast excerpt, he describes many of the obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in allowing airships to dock there. The first hurdle they faced was the constant change in nature and how it could affect airships. The airships would “rotate” due to the winds at the top of the building which were constantly moving due to the strong air currents. “This could put pedestrians on the street in danger as the ship is in motion and could be unstable. Another Eastern obstacle Outside the United States, airships “used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.” feet and cargo could be unstable due to the winds. The last obstacle encountered was the “existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” Therefore, it was illegal to approach airships close enough to buildings in a safe manner. All these obstacles encountered made workers and planners understand that this idea could not be achieved without harming or endangering people.  

<START>

 

The Empire State Building obstacle builders can be described as follows. First of all, the main obstacle was the nature of the mast. They described it as " the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts " (paragraph @ NUM1). Second, the airships hang from the top of the building, which was unsafe for pedestrians. Finally, there was a law for airships that could not fly too low or too high. The above explains the Empire State Building obstacles for airships.       

<START>

 

When architects and builders were planning how to build the mast on the Empire State Building, they encountered many obstacles. An example of a barrier they faced was that they had to build the mast so that it wouldn't fall when an airship docked. They couldn't use a cable. tie down to keep the mast down as this put a lot of pressure on the framing and foundation of the building. Another hurdle that builders faced was how to strengthen the structure of the Empire State Building. For the Empire State Building's frame to be strong enough to support the mast, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. These are a few examples of obstacles that manufacturers have had to face.

In the building of @ ORGANIZATION1 becomes very competitive. He wants to build the tallest building in New York. When construction was in progress, he wanted to add a top or hat so that the mast could drop people directly into the building. But then there was a problem, they had to consult it to enable it. Irving then let Al know that the building was not going to be done on time, because of the mast. This is what the Empire State Building faced during its contraction.     

<START>

 

Throughout the design and construction stages of the Empire State Building's mooring mast, builders and engineers faced many challenges, including the distribution of construction stresses, fire hazards, and constant changes caused by winds. During the planning stages of the engineers, they were faced with a problem, how to alleviate the stress on the framework of the Empire State Building. According to the engineers who make the "thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, it would add stress to the structure of the building ..." @ CAPS1, the building would require "more than sixty thousand dollars "for the overhaul and modification of the foundations and framework of the current building. Second, the engineers and builders never took into account the fire hazards they faced after the completion of the mooring mast. American airships were filled with hydrogen rather than helium, which made this transport filled with highly flammable gas. possible accident in the densely populated area of New York. Third, New York had "strong air currents" that could rotate and move the stern of airships. The only possible solution was to go all the way down with lead blocks, but that would be "neither practical nor safe".

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was that if an airship was moored by a single tether, "the stress of the airship's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was close by. eleven hundred feet below ". was that most foreign airships used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, and when the Hindenburg was destroyed, the builders realized that the crash would have been much worse if it had happened in a densely populated area like New York. A third obstacle was the strong wind currents which would cause the stern of the ship to pivot, and the stern of the airship could not be weighed down like in open airstrips as this would cause the weights to hang dangerously over pedestrians on the street. These were major obstacles, and these are the reasons why the mast on top of the Empire State Building was never used for dock airships.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. For example, the safety of the city and the airships was a concern. In paragraph thirteen, it is stated that " most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been had it taken place above of a densely populated area like downtown New York. " Plus, the biggest obstacle was really nature itself. " The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. " When an airship attempted to successfully use the mooring mast, the aft end of the airship swiveled around and around the mooring mast." were faced through this "architectural breakthrough" destroyed all hope of the building's true purpose.

Building anything is always a difficult task, but trying to build the tallest building in the world and having airships capable of docking to it is even more difficult. The workers modifying the Empire State Building encountered terrible obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock at the Empire State Building. The obstacle they couldn't control was nature itself. The winds would have been "constantly changing due to strong air currents", according to the extract, which made mooring the airships difficult and dangerous. Another factor that was a hindrance for builders was the building itself. The structure of the building would have to be changed as the airship would "add stress to the frame of the building," so builders would have to make the building withstand this enormous stress. Another obstacle was safe as some airships were filled with hydrogen which was extremely flammable and dangerous to the massive population on the ground. These are just a few of the many obstacles encountered when modifying the Empire State Building.       

<START>

 

The Empire State Building was and is the tallest building ever to be built. To make it the tallest building, the architects had to design the mooring mast. When building this mast there were many obstacles to overcome, but even with those obstacles it was still finished. The mooring mast was necessary because without it the Empire State Building would not be the tallest in the world. To operate the mooring mast, builders had to overcome certain obstacles. One of the main obstacles was to add on the mast, they would have to tie wire from the mast to the foundation. Another was that after designing the mast, they had to modify the original plans of the building.

The builders encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow the Airships to dock with the Empire State Building. Between @ CAPS1, security and nature, there was no way this idea could work. Although the idea was good, it was very impractical. Security was a major issue with this idea. Most airships used hydrogen rather than helium which is more flammable. If the airships ever caught fire over New York City, it would burn the whole place down and kill thousands of people. Nature was another big problem. The winds atop the Empire State Building were constantly changing. The vessel would pivot around the mooring mast. Airships typically docked in fields and used black lead weights to weigh them down. The weights hanging over people's heads were very dangerous. The construction of the mooring mast was very dangerous and impractical. This never happened for security reasons and now serves as a tea and soda area for psychics.

On @ DATE1, the Empire State Building was announced to reach the height of 1,250 feet. Al Smith, the architect of the building mentioned that the top would be more than ornamental. It was said that this incredible dream would come true for the pioneers of aviation. The building was going to have a mooring mast at its top to moor these new airships called airships, otherwise known as airships. This was thought to be a great idea. Things didn't go as initially planned and fate struck. When fate struck, things should have been more apparent before it was ever built. Resons being; Most airships out of states run on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is more flammable. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing, causing the airship to rotate, and it would be a disaster for anything to happen to New York City and the pedestrians it shelters. Another law was the law on the distance between airships and the building. Thus, always leaving the Empire State Building at 1250 feet, but never reaching the original objective.

The builders faced many obstacles when trying to build the Empire State Building. First of all for it to be a @ NUM1ft building it would have to have a very strong base to support it and they also had to strengthen the base so that they could mount the mooring mast on top. They also faced issues with the strong drafts that flowed over New York City. None of the airships were able to dock due to the high current. The mooring mast also put stress on the frame. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building held together by a single tether cable would add stress to the structure of the building." it proves how the builders were going to have a hard time with the construction of the Empire State Building.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. Airships are huge, steel-framed balloons that they can travel for long periods of time at a speed of seventy miles an hour. Thoogh airships seemed perfect for attracting people by means of travel in the modernization, the builders faced a complex obstacle. There was no suitable landing zone for airships. In trying to allow airships to dock there, there were many substantive changes to the building that had to be considered. The load carried out of the airship would add stress to the building frame, as would wind pressure. To accommodate buildings that can accommodate the airship, the price of building modifications would cost @ MONEY1. There are many obstacles that have been scientifically proven that the airship could not dock with the Empire State Building. The safety issue involving hydrogen gases being highly flammable was very risky in the densely populated New York City area. Nature was also a big obstacle that the wind faced at such a high altitude. The law implying that airships could not fly too low was a practical reason why airships could not dock at the building. "A group of engineers here in New York are trying to come up with a workable and workable arrangement and the government folks in Washington are looking for a safe way to tie airships to this mast." A quote from Al Smith. Obstacles involving the idea of moderate transport were too impractical in using the mooring mast for airships on the Empire State Building

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their efforts to allow the airships to dock on the mast. One issue was security. Some airships were filled with hydrogen, which the article said was "highly flammable". @ CAPS1 an airship catching fire just above a densely populated area would be dangerous. Nature was another factor. The "strong drafts" made it difficult to maneuver an airship and brought it close enough to the mast to dock. Yet even if these frustrating conditions did not exist, it would still have been impossible for an airship to tie up to the mast, as it was illegal. A law prohibited "airships [from] flying too low over urban areas," which included airships. These obstacles were overlooked in the plans to create the Empire State Building.        

<START>

 

In @ ORGANIZATION2's "The Mooring Mast", he focuses on the obstacles that the Empire State Building builders encountered in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The laws made it impossible for the mast's original purpose, "An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law prohibited a ship from mooring to the building or even approaching the area. .. ". Some airships tried, but for reasons of wind and safety the idea was abandoned. The safety of all human beings was involved in the construction, "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire ... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a region ... ". When dealing with other countries, you should take into account that they may not use the safest things. Mother Nature can be a funny thing, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly turning ...". With the wind changing at all times, it can be difficult for a ship to land. When building something, always be prepared for obstacles.       

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. Architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on top. If they did, the foundations of the entire building would have to be changed. Nature was also a major reason for stopping the project. The gooseberry wind was still changing and the airship was swirling. Safety was the main reason for stopping work. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if the airship, which is said to be over New York, ignites, many people would be killed. In conclusion, these obstacles are the reason why the builder stopped and did not complete the Empire State Building project.       

<START>

 

The Empire State Building encountered many problems in allowing airships to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of people. Most airships used hydrogen instead of helium to power their airships, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. The death toll would be astronomical in a population as dense as downtown New York. Another obstacle encountered in this creation was nature. The winds atop the Empire State Building were constantly turning, and the idea of an airship hanging over pedestrians was unsure. The last reason airships weren't safe was the law in the United States. At the time of the construction of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. As a result, the airship was too close to the ground and was not cleared to dock. The idea of mooring airships to the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are many obstacles that preclude it.       

<START>

 

When the builders of the Empire State Building considered docking major airships at the top, there were a few critical flaws. On the one hand, a thousand-foot airship moored at such a small focal point with the pressure of the wind and its own load would put enormous pressure on the building's frame (p. @ NUM1). This could potentially lead to the collapse of the building due to the stress. Another reason was that at such altitudes the wind is quite strong and would cause the back of the airship to sway over thousands of pedestrians below, which is neither "... practical or safe". (p. @ NUM2). If something went wrong, the airship could take away another building or worse: fall. A more practical legal obstacle was a law against the presence of airships over cities. Mooring an airship to a mast, even at this height, was illegal (p. @ NUM3). Therefore, with so many obstacles, it was deemed impractical to use the Empire State Building as a high-altitude dock.        

<START>

 

There are a lot of issues trying to dock airships to the Empire State Building. First, there was a German airship called Hindenburg that caught fire from the hydrogen. An airship fire over dense New York City would result in the loss of many lives. Second, the wind 1250 feet in the air is very strong and unpredictable. There was no way to be sure the airships could even dock or be controlled when docked. Finally, there is a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. It would almost certainly be illegal for an airship to be so close to a building with so many people inside. Since these issues could all lead to fatalities, the idea was rejected.

The builders of the @ ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles to try to allow airships to dock there. At the start of the preparation, the builders thought it would be a good idea to let airships (also called airships) dock there. They did not take into account the obstacles and struggles they would soon face. The builder did not take into account the wind pressure and what the stress of the airship load would do to the building. “ The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. " It was a huge problem for architects and a sum of silver1 had to be made to the building structure. "Security was another big issue as well." Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Had a fire started in a densely populated area like downtown New York, the results could have been disastrous. Winds were also a problem. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would sway and could result in a dangerous accident. There were also laws against low flying ships. The architects of the Empire State Building should have thought about it.

In order for the airships to dock with the Empire State Building, the builders had to meet a lot of expectations and make sure everything was okay, but in doing so, they had to face a lot of obstacles. The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Another hurdle that manufacturers faced was that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. They realized how much worse it could be, especially in a more populous area like downtown New York. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly changing due to strong air currents. With all of these obstacles, the builders realized that it wouldn't work.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems with mooring airships to the mooring mast. Some, I don't even know, @ CAPS5, I'll just build from here and @ CAPS1 what @ NUM1.

In the article "The Mooring Mast", Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1 describes how safety, law and nature are the three main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow airships to be released. 'moor there. Safety was the main reason the airships could not be docked in @ ORGANIZATION2. The biggest safety hazard was that many countries outside of @ LOCATION2 were using hydrogen in their airships instead of helium. A German airship was recently destroyed in a fire in New Jersey because "hydrogen is highly flammable" (@ CAPS1, @ NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building realized that the crash would have been much worse if it had happened, "over a densely populated area like downtown New York" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1 ) and by mooring airships there, they run the risk that it could happen. Nature was another big obstacle that hampered the success of a mooring mast. The strong drafts at the top of the Empire State Building always caused the winds to change, so because only the front of the airships was attached to the mooring mast, "the stern of the ship swiveled" (@ CAPS1, @ NUM1). They couldn't use lead weights to weigh down the back as they used it in open fields, as having weights hanging over pedestrians on the street "was neither practical nor safe" (@ CAPS1, @ NUM1). Nature was a major obstacle because it couldn't be changed and there was no easy way to fix the problems it was causing. The final hurdle was an existing law that prevented airships from "flying too low over urban areas" (@ CAPS1, @ NUM5). This law prohibited the vessel from approaching the area and mooring to the vessel, which was a huge obstacle that was impossible to bypass. Safety, legal, and natural obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it impossible to dock the airships to Moore's mast on the building.

In the clip The Mooring Mast from @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building face several obstacles when trying to allow airships to dock there. The first obstacle encountered was the design of a mooring mast capable of withstanding the constraints of the airship's load. In the @ NUM1 stanza, the author writes : “ A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the frame of the building. " @ CAPS1, the steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and enhanced to improve this problem. Then the biggest obstacle they faced was the high winds at the top of the building. In the @ NUM2 stanza, it says : "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast." This happened as a huge problem as the architects could not make the stern of the ship heavier as it could endanger pedestrians. Finally, in the @ NUM3 stanza, it is stated that there is "a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas". @ CAPS1, it would be illegal for airships to attach to the Empire State Building or even approach the area. Because of these three obstacles, the project to use a mooring mast has become a thing of the past.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The first problem or obstacle they encountered was putting a mooring mast on top of the building. They couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top, as that would put stress on the building that would spread to the foundation. The structural steelwork of the building should be altered so that the building alone can support the mooring mast. Then the builders noticed that a large number of airships, coming from outside the United States, were filled with hydrogen, not helium. The problem was that hydrogen is highly flammable. This was shown in Lakehurst, New Jersey, where a German airship crashed and was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937. The builders went back and reflected on how New York is a heavily populated place and what kind of bad effect it would have had on civilians. The biggest hurdle that builders faced was the nature of it. There were strong winds with a mooring mast, which would force the airships to rotate and move in all directions. When planes were docked in open fields they were weighed down with lead weights, but on the Empire State Building they swayed above civilians and pedestrians on the street causing great harm to the public. .

The excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted reveals that the architects of the Empire State encountered a number of obstacles. Not only was the building's construction now competitive, its expectations were unrealistic. The idea of such a masterpiece of a building had a number of potential problems that its architects were not very competitive with. As the ongoing work on the Chrysler Building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested adding a mooring mast, not only to make the building taller, but to add to its purpose. Adding a mooring mast, however, would require a lot of planning. If a giant steel-framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as it is, it could dangerously shake the building's foundation, so the building's frame had to be rebuilt much stronger. In addition, the architects did not realize the danger of mooring airships. The airships, or airships, were fueled by hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and has proven to be a threat to the thousands of people living below.

In the clip The Mooring Mast from @ ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles that attempted to allow airships, also known as airships, to dock there. some of those hurdles faced by builders were that architects couldn't drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building. Attaching a thousand foot airship to the top of the building frame " would add stress to the building frame ." @ CAPS1 in paragraph @ NUM1. "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly @ NUM2 feet below." In addition, it was very dangerous to allow the highly flammable airship to pass through a densely populated area. Finally, the article states that "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". The vessel would "pivot" around the mooring mast. Airships should land in open fields, where they could not hang over pedestrians.

There were a lot of hurdles the builder faced in trying to get airships to dock here are a few. First off, having something of that big lot on a @ NUM1 foot building would add a lot of stress to the framing of the building. All this stress had to be distributed throughout the eleven hundred foot building, which was unthinkable. In order to make the building suitable for all that weight, it would cost over sixty thousand dollars and that was a lot considering everything they were doing. These were @ CAPS1 a few obstacles they had while trying to get airships to dock atop the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. Due to all the modifications they would need to do to have a mooring mast would cost over sixty thousand dollars. It was such an expensive modification because they "couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the" flat roof of the Empire State Building. The constraint that a thousand-foot airship would place on the frame of the building would be too great, it was their obstacle. The builders had to reinforce and modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building in order to keep the airships as desired.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock on the building. Mainly, the idea just wasn't practical. Having an airship up to @ NUM1 foot full of flammable nitrogen hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. An accident and tons of lives would be at stake. Especially after the crash of the German airship Hindenburg, workers knew that if it happened in New York, their death toll would be huge. Along with the extreme perels that the builders knew would be in play, Mother Nature wouldn't make airships any easier. dock at the Empire State Building. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. The drafts were too violent and presented many threats of danger. Even when the ship was anchored, the stern of the ship swiveled as if it were attached to a hinge. Lead tools can be used to weigh the airship down, but hanging over tons of people would not be a safe idea. Overall, the idea of having an airship connected to the Empire State Building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock there @ CAPS1 was the actual design of the docking and the modifications that should be made to the building. Due to the wind pressure and the load of the airship, the building structure had to be reinforced. The mast would also have to support keeping the airship down with a single cable tie, which would put a lot of strain on the mast and the building. Another issue that manufacturers encountered was the fact that airships outside of the United States used most of the hydrogen, not helium, in the balloon, which made it more flammable and dangerous. If ever a fire caught fire over New York, it would be disastrous. Finally, there was already a law prohibiting airships from flying at low altitude over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to dock or even approach the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, most of them too great to overcome. When it came to trying to get airships to dock on the ship's spire.

There are a few hurdles that builders have encountered. face in this project. One of them was to build the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building. The architect-designed Chrysler building extended it by 46 feet. When this was done, the builder had to make the Empire State Building taller, but make it something "as mundane as a water tank" (@ NUM1 ¶ Al Smith) Another example was trying to make a stop for airships. These things could go up two @ NUM2 miles an hour. They were as long as 1,000 feet. It would take @ NUM3 blocks in New York. They didn't have a good landing zone. A third obstacle they faced was nature. The wind was still blowing. No matter what they need, hanging airships over a city of innocent people was very dangerous.

When planning this architectural masterpiece, the builders encountered many obstacles. This plan to have a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building certainly did not live up to expectations. The first big issue was the great stresses on the building frame when the zepplins would be docked at the top, the pulling force would impact the foundation as well. The second problem was the cost of modifying the skyscraper to meet the needs of not stressing the frame. Safety was also a major issue; most airships are filled with hydrogen which is a highly flammable gas, even if it exploded it would hover above one of the largest cities in the country. With the new geographical positioning @ CAPS1, the wind is very strong off the ocean, these violent air currents constantly change direction, which could cause the zepplin to crash into the building. The last obstacle was the law against airships, they could not fly low over crowded urban cities.       

<START>

 

four main obstacles prevented airships from docking with the Empire State Building. The first was that a much more complex mooring mast would have to be installed on top of the Empire State Building, a mast very different from the regular masts found in open-air mooring areas. When an airship docked on the mast, there was a lot of strain on the building's frame, a problem that could be addressed by increasing the strength of the steel frame. Another problem was that an airship was made of hydrogen and could easily catch fire and explode. Engineers saw that this would cause big problems in a densely populated area like New York City. Once the mast was built, a new problem arose, although the airship could dock, the intense winds could cause the stern of the airship to move violently, or prevent an airship from docking, like the innocent with the Los Angeles. They also could not use lead weights to weigh down the balloon as they would pose a danger to civilians. Finally, a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas could have prevented docking. These reasons made it impossible to dock a ship atop the Empire State Building, although two ships came very close.

Basically, this excerpt talks about the "Mooring mast". It's all about construction. One of the hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was security. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." This quote reveals that the airships they made are highly flammable and dangerous to people's lives. Imagine the airship is on fire as it flies high into the sky, it causes lives. The other obstacle that builders face is that it is against the law. "The other practical reason that airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was the current law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas." Even though the building is the tallest building in New York City. But it is still too low for the laws. The airship cannot fly that low over the urban area, it causes accidents. The Empire State Building is over 1,250 feet, which means that there are strong, high winds at the top of the building and similar airships could not stop and approach the top of the building. "In December 1930, the US Navy airship @ CAPS1 Angeles approached the mooring mast and was unable to get close enough to moor due to the strong wind."

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of these obstacles was the number of modifications that had to be made to the building frame, as indicated in paragraph @ NUM1. The other hurdle they faced was the fact that most countries outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, preventing airships from s 'stop in a densely populated area like downtown New York, as described in paragraph @ NUM2. A final hurdle they faced was the existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. These are the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles to allow airships to dock there. The wind caused a big problem in the mooring of the airships "The body of the airship could sway in the breeze" (paragraph 6). The rocking of the airship body would cause a pull on the building that the current building frame would not be able to withstand. " The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below " (para @ NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building now had to reinforce and modify the structure of the building to accommodate the constraints of the loads of airships. Another obstacle that the builders of the building faced was the frame of the mast. The roof had to be finished before the mast framing could take place. Workers had to work another two months after the building was already completed due to Al Smith's idea of allowing airships to dock at the Empire State Building. The builders worked hard to adapt the new building for mooring airships. Unfortunately, their work was wasted.          

<START>

 

Attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building created many obstacles for its builders. Some of them weren't even discovered until they finally tried to do so. The first of the builders' problems began by trying to prepare the vessel itself for the added stress that would be applied when airships tried to dock. They spent @ MONEY1 on modifications to strengthen the building frame. Then "Rather than building a utility mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a tower in shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel ..." This created a lot of unnecessary work for the workers, as well as obstacles. There was also a lot of danger associated with the mooring of airships that the builders had to deal with. The changing and violent air currents would force them to make the mast as strong as possible and allow for the movement of airships. Finally, builders discover the biggest hurdle, which is that it's legal for airships to fly this low over urban areas, so technically they weren't even allowed to do what they did. Thinking back, it is obvious to see that "The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined never to serve its purpose ..."

There were a few hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was the strong wind currents that caused the rear of the airships to rotate : “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong air currents. Even though the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship swiveled. " A second obstacle was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making the mast almost useless. A third obstacle was that the foreign airships used hydrogen which is highly flammable. After the destruction of the airship called "The Hindenburg", "the owners realized how much worse the accident could have been had it taken place in- above a densely populated area like New York. These are the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there.

From the excerpt The Mooring Mast from @ ORGANIZATION2, the @ CAPS1 that the Empire State Building builders faced while trying to allow airships to dock, there was fire, wind and laws prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas. airships dock there, they would risk airship fire @ CAPS2 because airships from outside the US used hydrogen instead of helium. and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another obstacle would be the wind, the winds were moving due to the strong air currents. The stern of the ship would swivel and if they put weights on the stern it would not be safe for pedestrians on the street. And the last hurdle would be the law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas, I would make it illegal for a ship to tie into the building. These were the @ CAPS1 they were up against.

The wait for airships docked at the Empire State Building was very high. The men who built the massive structure should have realized that these expectations were realistic. Al Smith had planned for the airships to refuel and drop / pick up passengers at the dock at @ ORGANIZATION1. These plans would never manifest because; because in airships were powered by hydrogen and it is highly flammable, which could lead to disaster, the winds atop the Empire State Building were far too strong, and there was a law allowing planes to fly though low above urban areas. In an incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. The owners of @ ORGANIZATION1 saw " how much worse this accident could have been [in New York]." “ The biggest obstacle to using the mooring mass was nature itself ” because the wind was so strong. Airships couldn't even get The airship altitude law wouldn't even allow airships to approach @ ORGANIZATION1. The plans for the Empire State Building were never realistic and could never be realized.        

<START>

 

Wind was a huge problem during the construction of the Empire State Building. The building was so high that the top was not so stable. If they used airships on the Empire State Building, it would be dangerous as the weights would be suspended high in the air above all the heads of pedestrians. This plan was neither smart nor secure. The point of building it higher was just so that it could be the tallest building, there really was no good reason for that.    

<START>

 

Empire State Building alumni faced many complications Safety was a major concern. Dealing with strong winds would also be a problem. When the idea of the mast was created, few people realized the reality of the concept. Putting an extremely heavy object and attaching it to a simple clip was not secure enough. The combination of combustible gases also suggested putting New York City at risk. Landing on such a small roof would be difficult due to the strong winds. Guiding the airship to such a tricky landing would prove dangerous in the strong winds. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while constructing the mooring mast.

In "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. First, the building had a flat roof and an airship moored at the top, held only by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's frame. The modifications to the building would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Other problems encountered by the building were related to security. Some airships used hydrogen which is highly flammable and if an accident were to happen in New York it would be disastrous. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly changing and even strapped to the mooring mast the vessel would not be secure. It was also very dangerous. The Empire State Building never achieved its goal.        

<START>

 

The main problem with the original mooring mast design was that "the architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single cable tie, would add stress to the building frame. The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. " Another obstacle encountered by builders during construction of the mast could be another example of the German airship "Hindenburg". With some airships using highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium, another "Hindenburg accident" could prove fatal in a "heavily populated area like downtown New York". @ CAPS1 maybe the biggest obstacle would be "nature itself". High winds atop the Empire State Building would cause the airship to rotate around the mooring mast. Although airships could be ballasted, weights would be suspended over pedestrians, which "was neither practical nor safe".

The obstacles encountered by the builder of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were many. They were having issues with the area where they were going to do their work. "The only obstacle in their used expansion to New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone." Another obstacle they had was with the mooring mast. “ The biggest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot and around the mooring mast. " Then there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. And s' if they did, it would become illegal for the passing vessel to tie up to the building or even approach the area.

The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for a reason that should have been apparent even before it was built. the main reason was safety: most airships from the outside, the @ CAPS1 uni used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.

In the 1930s, the idea of having a mooring mast mounted on top of the Empire State Building for docked airships was a very popular theory. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles, such as existing laws regarding airships, flammable, hydrogen-powered airships, strong winds, and the stress that a moored airship would add to the frame of buildings. . “ Existing air traffic laws would make it illegal for a ship to dock with the Empire State Building or even fly nearby, as airships could not fly too low over urban areas (paragraph @ NUM1) . The destruction of the Hindenburg, a hydrogen airship, helped the owners of the Empire State Building realize just how dangerous airships can be, especially if they burned over downtown New York (paragraph @ NUM2 ). Strong winds would also be dangerous for airships moored to the Empire State Building, as the planes could not be very low in the air (paragraph @ NUM3). The building's steel frame would also have to be altered to accommodate the stress added by a moored airship. All in all it was very unrealistic for more airships at the Empire State Building as it would be dangerous.   

<START>

 

Manufacturers faced many obstacles such as safety, nature, flammability, and the law when attempting to allow airships to tie up to the mast. The first problem is that "the Empire State Building's mooring mast was never meant to serve its purpose." Airships also use hydrogen, not helium, which is highly flammable. The Hindenburg, a German airship was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and " the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much [it] could have been worse if it [happened] over an area densely populated like New York. The strong air currents also played a role, the stern of the ship turned and turned. When the airships docked in the airstrips, they were ballasted with lead weights, which would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. In addition, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There was no way the airships could tie up to the mast

The builders of the Empire State Building in New York have faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock. One of the obstacles of the builders was to create the Empire State Building with the strength to hold the airship, swaying in the wind, without the building falling. The weight of the airship was to be transferred to the bottom of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The biggest obstacle, however, was holding the airship in place as it was docked at the top of the building. The winds "constantly changed due to strong air currents" and made the airship fly wildly around the top of the building (@ CAPS1 paragraph @ NUM1). The vessel would never be used for any transportation purposes due to the dangers and obstacles of the mooring mast and airships.     

<START>

 

During the design and construction of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, engineers seem to have ignored some apparently useful information. As with any air or sea vehicle, the wind is either your enemy or your friend. Engineers should have given more consideration to the fact that changes in wind speed and direction at 1,250 feet in the air are huge threats. Your airship will have a hard time getting close enough to the mast to tie up, let alone remain stable enough for passengers to exit and board safely. Plus, if the law itself prevented you from floating your airship at such low altitudes, then it's over. Why even bother if it's illegal? While this sounds like futuristic sci-fi, and not to mention an utterly cool way to land with an airship, a lot has kept the idea from prevailing.

The owner of the Empire State buildings faced many obstacles. One obstacle was not having enough room for the airship to land. To help solve this problem, the architect added a mooring mast to increase the height of the buildings. Another obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be enlarged so that there was more height added to the building. In total, it would cost more than @ MONEY1. The main reason and the obstacle was security. The owner had to make sure that the airship was not flammable, in which it was located. Wind and nature also played a big part in the decision to go ahead with the idea. Strong winds would rotate the airship and move it constantly. This would make the airship suspended above people on the streets of New York, which was unsure. The idea that landing airships on top of the Empire State Building was neither safe nor practical, and there was just too much struggle and obstacle for a plan like this to ever succeed.

The builders faced many obstacles while constructing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. One thing was just that the building wouldn't have been strong enough to support the weight of the airships. As a result, they had to reinforce the entire frame of the entire building. They must have made sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to its frame. Having the right equipment on airships was also a problem. The airships did not have the right mooring tools to dock on this newly built mooring mast. The stern of airships could also be swung back and forth when moored, which was also a problem with mooring. Another problem was that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen which was highly flammable and they didn't want something that could easily catch fire near the building like that.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow the airship to dock there. The main reason airships couldn't dock there was because airships charged. The load would cause stress. Wind pressure is also another reason airships could not dock there. "Wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." The airships were moored using an electric winch. The electric winch was fine but, it is also said that "the airship could sway in the breeze", that could also have been a safety issue.

In @ ORGANIZATION2's "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while attempting to allow airships to dock there. For example, one was security. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." (@ NUM1) This shows that mooring airships can be harmful, as some buildings and many people can be adversely affected. The large business district is too densely populated to allow such a thing. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." (@ NUM2) This hurdle that manufacturers have faced has alluded to the fact that lives are at risk again, not to mention the very costly damage that airship clearance can cause. Another obstacle encountered by manufacturers was "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas". (@ NUM3) All of these hurdles that the builders faced were very significant and paved the way for the disarmament of the idea of airships to be moored atop the Empire State Building. The dangers involved were too great and the top of the building was now much safer.         

<START>

 

There were a lot of issues with the design of the airship mooring system. The first of these problems comes from the practicality of the concept. The winds created by updrafts in cities are strong and make landing an airship too risky. Another obstacle encountered was the structural design. The Empire State Building was not originally designed for mooring airships, and modifying the building to do so was expensive, "no more @ NUM1 doolars of modifications." low over buildings, "... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." These practicalities turned out to be difficult obstacles

The builders of the Empire State Building planned to use the building to make New York City the leader in modern travel. They built a mooring mast that they planned to use to moor the airships. Unfortunately, there were unexpected difficulties and this goal was never achieved. When the architects first decided to add the mast to the Empire State Building, they realized they would have to rethink the supporting structure of the entire building because of the pressure a moored airship would put on the building. Even after this issue was resolved, there were many obstacles preventing the goal from being achieved. The architects had not seen many of the potential problems with the mast. It wasn't until after the mast was built that they realized that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium to stay afloat. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, was not a risk as the builders wanted to take over the densely populated city. The architects also realized that the unpredictable high winds at the top of the mast would be too dangerous to dock an airship. Once these obstacles appeared, it became evident that the Empire State Building would never dock an airship.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles during construction, according to Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast article. The biggest obstacle is allowing airships, or airships, to dock where the forces of nature, such as wind and gravity. As in the article, the "winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts." It was dangerous for the airship passengers and pedestrians below to be near the airship and the turbulent air. In addition, the flammability of hydrogen in the airship was a problem; it was very dangerous to have a fire hazard @ NUM1 feet long, floating near a densely populated place like New York. On top of that, laws that airships couldn't fly too close to urban areas prohibited airships from even approaching the mooring mast above the Empire State Building. A test with the US Navy airship Los Angeles proved it to be too dangerous and impractical; the airship couldn't even get close enough to dock. Overall, the mooring mast above the Empire State Building was a great idea, but too many obstacles stood in the way for it to be used.

Architects faced many challenges in trying to get airships to dock on the Empire State Building. The very first problem the architects faced was adding a mooring mast to the building as they couldn't just drop one, they had to go back and re-support the entire skeleton of the building. Another problem is that if the airship broke down like the Hindenburg, it would fly away in a fireball into a heavily populated town below. The biggest problem that architects had to face was nature itself. There were constant high winds if an airship was attached it would move violently and descend @ CAPS1 on pedestrians below which is too risky for architects.

When attempting to add a docking mask to the Empire State Building, the people who added it encountered several obstacles. From the outset, manufacturers took into account the size of an airship. If there was something this tall at the top of the building, the frame would be warped. To solve this problem, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars to change the original frame, to a more suitable one. Another obstacle the mast builders encountered was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a dredge attempting to moor. Also, they realized that the mast was over a large urban area, so if there was an accident bad situations would occur. There was also a law on planes traveling too low over a city. The mooring dock atop the Empire State Building wasn't meant to be.

The Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. The airships were moored using an electric winch. The biggest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature. The winds at the top of the building were swirling due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted at the rear with lead weights, which was neither practical nor safe. The only obstacle to their use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. An early morning mast added to the top of the building would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and lift passengers up and down.

There were many different obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. For example, an existing law ensured that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which meant that an airship could not tie up to the building or approach the area. Another problem was to make the mast strong enough to support an airship. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1, "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame." This shows that improvements had to be made to the mast. One of the biggest problems with the mast construction was the problem of filling airships with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. The owners of the building remembered the German airship Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in 1937, and how much worse the accident would have been if it had taken place in a densely populated area.

There were a few obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. An airship is an airship, giant steel balloons filled with hydrogen and helium. The airships lacked a suitable landing zone in New York. Al Smith was governor of New York for four terms. He came up with the idea that a mooring mast added to the Empire State Building would allow airships to dock there, refuel, and passengers could safely get on and off the airship. Architects and builders had to consult experts. So they took workers to @ ORGANIZATION2, mass tested and met with the president of a newly formed airship company. After all these obstacles, they could finally build the mooring mast.

Marcia Amidon Lüsted's Mooring Mast describes the construction of the Empire State Building mast. The mast was originally added to add height to the thousand foot building. However, Al Smith, one of the builders, wanted the mast to "serve the higher purpose" of providing a docking station for airships. This idea turned out to be very difficult. First, the builders had to modify the structure of the tower to make it strong enough to support the weight of the airship swaying in the wind. Lüsted writes: " The stress of the airship load ... should be transmitted to the foundation of the building ... " When the mast was finally built, builders were faced with the problem of having the airships " for quite a while. above pedestrians. on the street. ” If one ever fell, hundreds would be killed. Finally, there was a law that prevented“ airships from flying too low over urban areas. ” By docking with the Empire State Building, airships would break this law. Although this is a good idea, "The Mooring Mast" shows that it would not be possible for airships to dock atop the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles to allow airships to dock there. Safety was the biggest concern at every step. The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems in the docking of these planes. If an airship were to explode in downtown New York, it could be a disaster. Another obstacle he would face is nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind at the top of the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At that time, laws prohibiting low-level flying in urban areas were emerging. This would make mooring airships illegal. The idea of making the Empire State Building a berth was a technical feat, but its actual use was impractical.

The obstacles that builders face in attempting to allow airships to dock are that a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building would add stress to the building frame. The stress of the dirigibe load and the wind pressure should also be transmitted. It should be passed down to the foundations of the buildings, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame would have to be modified and reinforced, which would represent more than sixty thousand dollars.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building were really tough. The worker had to make sure that the building was not so high that it would tilt as well. Workers also faced competition. They needed the building to be the tallest and they didn't give up until the building was the tallest building in @ CAPS1.

Builders trying to allow airships to dock above the Empire State Building have encountered problems. The weight of the airships and the wind pressure would add stress to the vessel. With @ CAPS1 to be transmitted to more than @ NUM1 ft up to the foundation of the building. Construction was not the only problem. Most @ CAPS2-American airships are kept afloat by Hellium which is extremely flammable and if they were @ CAPS3 in the busy and crowded streets of New York, many people could have been killed. Nature added to the problems. Wind currents had the potential to push airships into buildings @ CAPS4, causing them to burst. The final problem was that @ CAPS5 was already in place which would not allow low flying planes. The builders were faced with issues with nature, @ CAPS5, safety and construction which led to the demise of the use of the mooring system.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered enormous obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. First, new friends should include more money. Anything done on top of such a tall building should be balanced by strengthening the foundation. According to paragraph @ NUM1, "more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the building". Another big hurdle that the builders should have faced was finding a way to neutralize the strong wind currents at the top of the building @ DATE1 ft. Even if the front of the airship was anchored to the mooring, the stern would sway in the wind. Any accident or damage to an airship over such a populated area as downtown New York would have devastating results. In conclusion, the risks of allowing airships to dock atop the Empire State Building outweighed the rewards. When airship travel became less convenient, the plan was scrapped altogether.

many hurdles were overcome while trying to get the Empire State Building to allow airships to dock there. It was a long, difficult and thoughtful process. Workers could not simply put a mooring mast on the roof of the building. A thousand foot airship moored at the top of the building. It was held together by a single tether cable, which added stress to the building frame. The architects also had to build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within, with a recessed design that mimicked the general shape of the building. They later realized the airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building. One of the reasons being a law banning airships flying low over urban areas. Architects went through many obstacles in the construction of masts.

The problems faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were delicate and potentially deadly ones. The first being as mentioned in paragraph @ NUM1. When he explains that if an airship tried to dock and something went wrong and caught fire, it would cause serious damage to people below on the streets. Another hurdle that builders faced was the "biggest hurdle" in paragraph @ NUM2. the fact that the wind at the top of the tower would whip the airship with just a cable holding it to the mooring mast. Do not make it safe for anyone around the building or in the airship. Another reason that the builders had to understand during the construction of the mast, was that no airship flying at low altitude could enter the area as mentioned in paragraph @ NUM3. These are some of the problems that builders had to face if they wanted to tie airships to the building.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the Empire State buildings after construction that led to it being the tallest building in the United States. Although builder Al Smith encountered many obstacles, they had to face the most difficult when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. One of the obstacles is allowing airships to anchor for several hours for refueling or service, and allowing passengers to get on and off. Another obstacle is letting airships dock as they need a place to attach to a mast. It is stated that " the airships were moored by means of an electric winch, which pulled in line from the bow of the ship, then tied it to a mast " (Lüsted @ NUM1) This can be a problem as the mast body could sway in a lot of breeze. Although there were many obstacles, Al Smith managed to get around them and finished the Empire State Building with courage to face all obstacles.

In this excerpt from "The Mooring Mast," @ ORGANIZATION2 describes the architectural, chemical, and legal challenges that have prevented the construction of a mooring dock for airships atop the Empire State Building. Despite the will of the then - @ CAPS1 Al Smith, who publicly announced the plan, and John Tauranac, who reported that the top of the Empire State Building "would serve a higher calling [than] to add a few desired feet. ", @ ORGANIZATION 2 maintains that the failure of the mast" should have been apparent before it was ever built ". According to the article, the mast and a moored airship " would add stress to the structure of the building ." Over sixty thousand dollars have been spent to deal with the pressure. Foreign airships also contained hydrogen, which was more flammable than helium used in the United States. An explosion above the Empire State Building would be devastating for the city. An existing law prevented airships from "even approaching" the building. @ ORGANIZATION2 uses these reasons to detail the unrealistic nature of the mooring mast.

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were difficult. One of the hurdles they faced was repairing the Empire State Building and the cost was high. For example, in the excerpt it says that " the steel framing of the Empire State Building would have to be altered and reinforced to suit the new situation, over sixty thousand dollars of alterations were to be made to the framing of the building ”. The plan was never fully implemented because safety was an issue. The fires and injured people on the streets were a big risk they couldn't take. It was also illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The obstacles that the manufacturers had to face made the idea impossible to realize.        

<START>

 

The architects had few problems. As noted in @ LOCATION1, the stress from the load on the airships was too great for the vessel. They would @ CAPS1 over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. Other then that they @ CAPS2 had to rethink and then do it.

In the short story, "The Mooring Mast", there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was the load of the airship and the wind pressure on the foundation of the building. “ The stress of the airship's load in the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The Empire State Building's steel frame would have to be altered and reinforced to accommodate this. new situation. " @ CAPS1, it was a big obstacle for the landing process airships. Another problem they had was that airships use hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. S ' it had caught fire, it wouldn't have been good for a populated city. "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was never intended to serve its purpose. Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. " If the airship caught fire in the building, the lives of many people would be in danger. . in conclusion, the mooring mast did not work for many reasons, but safety and airship load and wind pressure on the foundations of the building were two large obstacles to allow airships to dock.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were many, but the main obstacles were the danger posed by airships, nature, and an existing law prohibiting airships. airships flying too low over suburban areas. . According to the reading, the danger with airships was that "most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is considered highly flammable." This danger was highlighted by the German airship Hindenburg when it was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Nature was also a great obstacle because of the "winds at the top of the building" which "moved constantly due to the strong drafts". Because of these winds, it was almost impossible to moor an airship to the mooring mast without it moving madly. The final obstacle, the law, "would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area." Unless the law is repealed, the mooring mast could never function. However, the obstacle that the builders encountered when designing the mast itself was that " the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be altered and reinforced " because " the stress of the load of the airship and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building "which turned out to be" more than sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications ".

During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders had to deal with many @ CAPS1 in an attempt to allow the driggers to tie up to it. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's reading selection The Mooring Mast, he deals with most of the @ CAPS1s that have been encountered. For example, one obstacle they had to face was finding a landing pad because there was a huge lack of a suitable landing pad in New York City. The second @ CAPS1 they faced was how to make the airship global. The architects had meetings with the government about the airship mooring tracks at this mast. The builders used many @ CAPS1s to use the airships, but that ultimately wasn't enough to implement the plan.

One of the hurdles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there was how to do it safely. According to the reading, it is said that "most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable." Another obstacle was nature itself. This sentence, " the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts ," located at the beginning of the paragraph @ NUM1, proves that mooring airships to the mooring mast above the Empire State Building was dangerous. Last but not @ CAPS1, another reason the airships couldn't dock was because it was illegal. There was "an existing law against airships flying low over urban areas." Because of this law, it would even be illegal for airships to approach the area. It would therefore be impossible for a ship to land there.

The builders of the Empire States Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1, the author mentions that they must have considered the Hindenburg incident which took place on May 6, 1937, "The owners of the Empire State Building realized how badly the accident would have have been worse if it had occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York, "says the author. They realized that the safety of people should take precedence in all scenarios. in addition , another obstacle that Al Smith and the builders faced was the mooring of the airship when people are down. At paragraph @ NUM2, the author says: "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mast. mooring was nature itself. " Airships @ CAPS1 are often moored in open fields, the weights to hold the stern of the ship can be used safely. But over a heavily populated area it was out of the question, because the lead weights suspended above pedestrians constitute a security isolation. Builders have encountered many obstacles in the design of the use of the mooring mast.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The thousand-foot airship atop the Empire State Building could add stress to the building's structure. The stress on the airship was far too much to bear, and the building's frame would have had to be altered and reinforced to be able to support the airship. There were many risks involved in landing an airship on top of the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was that a thousand foot airship held by a single tether cable added stress to the frame. The obstacle they went through was to make the framework more solid. In paragraph @ NUM1, he indicates the obstacle they crossed to reinforce the building. “ The architects designed a tower in shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. " And" The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners. "Other obstacles they crossed were to ensure that the mooring mast was quite high, and paragraph @ NUM2 Smith said," people in Washington are looking for a safe way to tie airships to this mast. "       

<START>

 

The builders of this clip faced many challenges in trying to let the airships dock there. First of all, the entire structure of the Empire State Building should be changed. Having a mooring mast at the top of the building with an airship attached would put a lot of stress on the framing of the building. Stainless steel as part of the structure would need to be altered to make it stronger, but this is very expensive. The excerpt reads: "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether, would add stress to the structure of the building" (paragraph @ NUM1). Another challenge that builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that were already in place. The government did not want planes to fly too low over buildings. The excerpt read: "The other practical reason airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law against planes flying too low over urban areas." (paragraph @ NUM2). The excerpt also states that this law would make it illegal for a plane to tie up to or even approach a building.

There were three main obstacles to building an airship dock atop the Empire State Building. The first problem was security. Most airships from outside the United States were flammable because they "used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." When the Hindenburg was destroyed, they realized it would have been a lot worse for a heavily populated city. Another problem was nature. The winds "were constantly changing due to strong air currents" and the stern of the airship "swiveled around and around the mooring mast". The third problem was that there was a law in place. As Lüsted puts it, "[there] was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas."

Building a big chunk of work isn't easy. You have to fix the negatives and do everything right. Sometimes you never know you have to take things apart to get the hard work done right. When you are watching, you have done good things to prevent bad things from happening. You can deal with a whole lot of things when building. The Empire faced docking attempts when the construction of the airships to the wharf was not carried out or constructed properly. Even if it is said, swing to climb with increasing pressure. Although building things is difficult. You draw beauty and difficulties from it. It helps you remember that your wells are well done.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to dock the airships there. Some of the most apparent reasons were due to the makeup of airships, weather conditions, and existing laws regarding airships flying over urban areas. Airships weren't made from the safest materials, most were made with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. This would make the docking station unsafe if the airship caught fire. If the airship were to catch fire, the accident would be very serious, since the Station would be over a densely populated area. In paragraph @ NUM1 it says that "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". Due to the strong drafts at the top of the Empire State Building, the ship would pivot around the mooring mast, making mooring unsafe. If anything happened to the airship, it would be dangerous for the many pedestrians below. The last reason the docking station is not built is in paragraph @ NUM2 due to "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas". It would be illegal for an airship to tie up to the docking station because of this law. This law is due to the strong winds, fearing that they will blow the airship on other buildings. The docking station could not be built due to safety reasons and applicable laws.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a @ CAPS1 from @ CAPS2 as they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. The biggest problems faced by the builders were due to the safety and mooring of the airship itself. The hydrogen used in the airship was dangerous, as hydrogen is very flammable. If the hydrogen caught fire, especially in such a densely populated place as New York City, scores of people would be injured. In addition, the builders were faced with the task of mooring the airship. Airships were normally anchored with heavy lead weights. However, if these weights were used to anchor the airship above city streets, pedestrians below could potentially be injured. In fact, allowing the airship to dock raised another issue for builders to resolve : If the airship was attached to the mast atop the Empire State Building, the airship would swing around the mast to roll up. Ultimately, the builders weren't able to fix these issues and the Empire @ CAPS3 building is now primarily used as an observation deck and building.

Mooring an airship atop the Empire State Building is a feat that will likely never be accomplished. The main overall concern associated with this authorization is security. In @ CAPS1 @ NUM1, the author discusses the infamous destruction of the Hindenburg, and the architects realized that the crash would have been even more catastrophic if it had taken place over a city like New York. Nature has also played a role in this struggle to make this mast work. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2). The author then discusses how the airship would swing around the mast. And trying to weigh it down "was neither practical nor safe" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2). The final and most obvious reason why this mast could not work was that a law had been passed; a law that prohibited airships from flying too low into an urban area. This meant that an airship could not legally approach the mast. These architects had worked very little for them and almost everything worked against them.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's excerpt The Mooring @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building had a difficult task. They were building the tallest building in the world and when Al Smith, the building's construction manager, said to make it taller, things got even more difficult. Mainly because they wanted this new height to be used as a dock for airships. What they didn't know is that it's a bit more difficult than just attaching an airship to a building. They had many obstacles at hand. Architects would have to modify the building as a thousand foot airship moored on the building would add stress to the building. The airships used hydrogen which is extremely flammable, if it were to catch fire in downtown New York it would be disastrous. Nature is also a threat, the winds at the top of the building would cause the airship to rotate. The final hurdle is that there is a law that prohibits airships from flying at low altitudes in urban areas. Ultimately, the plan failed.

Al Smith and the engineers faced many obstacles while attempting to allow the airships to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle they faced was that most airships used hydrogen, hydrogen is a very flammable chemical, this could have led to the burning of the Empire State Building and the deaths of millions of people. people. Another obstacle they faced was mother nature. At a height of around 1,250 feet incredible winds blow, and even someone unexpected they can detonate the airship in the building, rendering it fatal. Finally, the law prohibits the airship from "flying too low over urban areas." therefore to do so would be illegal. the vessel faced many obstacles, it went through most of them, but in the end it would be extremely dangerous to continue with the mast.     

<START>

 

In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, from author @ ORGANIZATION1, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building @ CAPS1 faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were that architects couldn't just drop a Mooring mast atop Empire State flat roofed buildings. They were going to tie a single tether cable, but it would add stress to the framing of the buildings. They had to reinforce the building's frame, which made it possible to design a tower in shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel that would illuminate from the inside. When they tried it, the wind was too strong, moving constantly due to the strong air currents. The stern of the vessel would pivot around the mooring mast. They also couldn't take it into account because there was a law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas.

There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing airships to dock there. The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure must have been sent to the base of the building which was @ DATE1 foot below. Another problem that arose later was that other airships outside of the United States were made with hydrogen rather than helium, with hydrogen being highly flammable. Now that the German airship, the Hindenburg, has exploded in fire over @ CAPS1, New Jersey, architects now fear that it would be a bad idea to do this, because if it did happen over the city of @ LOCATION3, then many more lives would be at risk. Another obstacle also presented itself due to nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong wind currents. Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the aft end of the airship would be everywhere. This is why now the airships are moored to the ground and are held by weights on the sides @ NUM1. Another reason this is a problem is that docking an airship to the Empire State Building would be illegal because it flies too low to the ground. This law also makes it illegal to tie up the airship to the vessel.         

<START>

 

The builders had to overcome many obstacles. One of the hurdles was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be altered because the load of the airship and the pressure of the wind would have been transmitted to the foundation of the building. they had to pay over sixty thousand dollars for structural modifications.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles in order for the airships to land there. The builders had to find a way for the airships to attach to the Empire State Building, in order to "fill up with fuel or service, and let passengers get on and off" (¶ 6). Builders also had to find a way to securely attach the mooring mast to the top of the building. According to the text, with an airship attached by a single wire to the building, more stress would be added to the building frame so that they could not just drop the mooring mast above the building. In addition, the builders had to modify the foundation, so that it would not collapse if a durible was attached. Finally, the builders had to overcome the simple nature that they did not have, the winds at the top of the building were constantly rotating and they are in a densely populated city, so if things did go wrong, many people could be injured.

On the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" written by @ ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced were very difficult, in my opinion it didn't work out. Empire State Building architects and engineers consulted Empire State Building experts. Air station @ PERSON1, the head of the navy offered his airship to be used to test the mast. And to determine if it is acceptable to use the mast, architects could not simply drop a mooring mast, as this would put stress on the building frame. In addition, the Empire State Building's mooring mast was never intended to serve its purpose. It wasn't safe enough and because airships that come in from outside @ LOCATION2 don't always use helium, they use hydrogen which is highly flammable which is a bad idea. have in the @ CAPS1 of downtown New York.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast excerpt, builders faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. Although this idea was not successful, it took them a long time to understand the causes and effects of mooring airships. more than sixty thousand dall then were spent on modifications for the building. after repairing the structure of the building, the builders discovered that the weather had interfered. Due to the strong winds, the airships were constantly moving. There was no sure way to control the shifting. There was also a law against airships flying too low over populated cities. another reason was that airships were very dangerous and highly flammable. Trying to build a mooring mast was not a good idea.        

<START>

 

New York architects of the late 1920s and 1930s intended to revolutionize @ CAPS1 and put New York City at the forefront of modern travel. However, the crazy ideas did not come true. In an attempt to get ahead of the Chrysler Building, architect Al Smith added an unsecured pole to the top of the Empire State Building. The place where airships, or airships, could get passengers on and off and refuel, had more hype than study. The biggest hurdle that manufacturers faced was safety. Since most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, they were highly flammable. Had the German airship "Hindenburg" exploded over an area more densely populated than New Jersey, such as New York, the results would have been far more devastating. As indicated in paragraph @ NUM1, if the mast was successful, the weather would prove fatal. Even if the vessel was attached to the mast, it would continue to pivot. The US Navy tried to tie up next to the mast before a law was passed prohibiting planes from flying so low, but the wind can make their efforts in vain. The architects of the 1920s and 1930s thought big, but some obstacles were too great to overcome.          

<START>

 

When the idea of creating a command post for airships atop the Empire State Building, engineers failed to recognize several problems. The first was the problem of using highly flammable hydrogen to fill airships. The Hindenburg accident showed just how horrible one of these explosions is. The situation would have been much worse if there had been more @ NUM1 stories in the air. Second, strong gusts of wind would have made it impossible to dock the airship to the top of the building, especially when the use of usual lead weights would be both dangerous and impractical. Finally, a law was imposed before this project was ever considered, making it illegal to fly any airship this low into an urban area.       

<START>

 

Based on the excerpt "The Mooring Mast", it is clear that the architects were blind to the problems with the mast. Al Smith was becoming competitive to build the tallest building, which blinded him to potential risks. People eager to progress in the transport of their time had not fully analyzed the future complications. When designing the mast, paragraph nine quotes, "A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of a building ... would add stress to the frame of the building." Even as the mast progressed it was clear that this might not work. Two months later the building was reframed and the mast added. On May 6, 1937, the building owners realized that if an accident like the destruction of " Hindenburg " happened on top of the building, it would be devastation over densely populated downtown New York (paragraph @ NUM1) . Another obstacle, as said in paragraph @ NUM2, is nature itself. Winds at such high altitudes were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous to have a tethered airship to pivot around and around the mast. As a result, the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building never fulfilled its intended purpose, but is now a site tourists flock to. In the late 1930s, the idea of airships as a future means of transportation was replaced by airplanes.

The Builders - The designers of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles to allow airships to dock at the top. The first, and most apparent, was the frame of the building. The article says that "architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on top of the flat roof of @ ORGANIZATION1" (@ NUM1). The thousand foot tower would add additional stress to the building frame. Then comes the issue of security. Most of the international airships were filled with hydrogen, a very dangerous gas, and if set on fire they would cause a huge explosion, such as the German airship Hindenburg. If this same accident were to take place over New York City, many pedestrians would be injured or killed. Also, the wind played a huge obstacle. The winds were "constantly moving due to strong air currents" (@ NUM2) and therefore the stern of the vessel "rotated around and around the mooring mast" which would be extremely dangerous. Finally, and more simply, the law did not allow an airship to fly so low over urban areas. All these obstacles put together thwarted the idea of using the building as a mooring tower.

There would have been many obstacles that the builders of the @ ORGANIZATION1 would have faced if they had decided to allow airships to dock there. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." On @ DATE1, the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire at @ LOCATION3, New Jersey. the owners realized how much worse it would have been in a place like New York. Another big obstacle would have been nature itself. "The winds at the top of @ ORGANIZATION1 were constantly shifting due to strong air currents." If the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would shift, making it difficult for pedestrians to get on and off. If they had weighed it down with a lead weight, then there would be a heavy lump of lead hanging over the pedestrians in New York City. The last hurdle the builders of the state @ ORGANIZATION1 empire would have had to face “was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.” This law would not allow airships to dock above @ ORGANIZATION1 . They are not even allowed to approach @ Organization1.

The Empire State Building is one of the tallest buildings ever to be built. Thus it was impossible for an airship to moor on the mooring mast. The @ ORGANIZATION1 article titled "The Mooring Mast" describes the problem that airships may have encountered. “ The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The gains at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast. " That's right, if an airship tried to moor to it, it would just hover around the mooring mast. Mooring mast. It could crash into other buildings as well. It could rip open the mooring mast. There was so much that the builders hadn't looked at.        

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered a few obstacles when they tried to allow the airships to dock at the top of the very tall building. The first obstacle achieved was the security concerns. Most airships used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flammable. Another obstacle that was difficult to avoid was nature in general, as the author mentioned. Wind currents at the top of the building were sporadic, and this could be a huge problem for airships trying to dock. However, the biggest obstacle that the builders never realized was that it was even illegal. The height of the Empire State Building was too low for a plane of some sort to land on it. It could be a danger to the urban areas below. These are the main obstacles that caused the breakage of the mooring mast.        

<START>

 

The builders did not have a suitable landing zone for the airship, and if the airship landed on the flat roof of the Empire State Building, it would add stress to the building. Money was one of the big issues that manufacturers faced. In paragraph @ NUM1, it is said that the biggest obstacle was nature, the strong winds at the top of the building were moving due to the strong draft. because the airship itself would pivot around the mooring mast, and for the safety of people as well. Another obstacle was the law, which prohibited flying too low over urban areas.    

<START>

 

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were to build a structure with a top stable enough to hold an airship. However, once the Chrysler Building got taller than the Empire State Building, the idea of airships slowly faded, unnoticed. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1, Al Smith said he would put a top or hat on the building to make it taller. The only problem is that instead of docking the airships there, they would just be sitting next to the tip of the building. If Smith weren't so competitive, airships would have a nice platform to dock on.    

<START>

 

During the construction and construction of the Empire State Building to allow the mooring of airships, it took a lot of thought on the part of the builders. They first had to see what the building could withstand and try to calculate what was in it so that it did not fall. Then they had to figure out the safety of passengers and pedestrians, a way to get in and out as safe and easy as possible. Despite all the work the builders put into crafting Al Smith's idea, the odds just weren't realistic for the public and the plan had to be stopped. Although that makes a good story and is a crucial learning block for builders.

According to the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the first problems they encountered was not being able to land. "The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone." (@ CAPS1 6). This was a major problem as they had nowhere to land this object; it cannot modernize their movements. Another issue that manufacturers faced was safety. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) This caused a problem as how airships from other countries would visit us if they posed a threat to human safety. They weren't going to take that risk. A third problem was nature and the weather. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2) The airships had a very unstable landing. The winds beat them. It was very dangerous @ CAPS5, that's why it became an obstacle for the builders.

The hurdles that the builders faced with the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock are there. The possible dangers of having something fall on them.

Obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock. When the Empire State Building was designed, it was planned like the one of the world.

Before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to get ahead. that airship or zeppelin and the @ ORGANIZATION2 was going to have a mooring mast on its top for mooring.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock. One of those hurdles was the lack of proper landing zones in New York City. Another obstacle was that architects could not drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. An airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame. However, the biggest obstacle was nature. The wind at the top of the building is constantly moving due to strong drafts. The stern of the ship pivoted around the mooring mast while it was moored.

Throughout the construction of the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock with the building: One obstacle that builders encountered was the fact that when an airship was attached to the building by a single cable, it added a lot of stress to the building framing due to a combination of the load from the airships and the wind pressure at the top of the massive foot structure @ DATE1. To solve this problem, construction had to make more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building's frame. Another obstacle encountered was the security of the mooring of the airship. One problem is that many airships from the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made owners realize how much worse an accident was, but what happened to the Hindenburg, could be in such a densely populated area. Another safety issue was the high wind speed. even when an airship was moored to the mooring mast, the stern of the vessel would sway violently due to the strong winds at @ DATE1 feet. In addition, airships could usually be ballasted in a field with lead weights to prevent movement, but "using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe ". @ CAPS1 with these two reasons there was already a law against airship height in urban areas and speaking with an airship to the building it would break it. As this paragraph shows, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there.

In the extract "Le Mât d'Amarrage", by @ PERSON1, the builders of @ ORGANIZATION1 oppose by trying to allow airships, or airships, to dock there. First of all, they needed a suitable landing zone, which was a mooring mast. But before building the mast, "the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation." Workers framed the building up to the 85th floor, but before the mast framing could take place, the roof had to be completed. Before moving on to the next stage of the project, the architects suddenly realized how dangerous and disastrous the result could be. The “Hindenburgs” set a good example of why they couldn't do it. The area around the building was too densely populated. The airship had a high chance of causing a disaster over New York City, given the strong drafts. The project was just too risky, but it was a great idea involving future transportation.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles to allow the airships to dock there. The main issue was security. When the bow was masted to the building, the stern moved. Another big problem was that the airships were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Additionally, it was illegal for airships to fly this low over urban areas. Another obstacle was that the airship could not get close enough to the building because of the wind.     

<START>

 

In attempting to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered major obstacles. The first riddle posed to the builders concerned the structure. They realized that " the stress of airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted ... to the foundation of the building ." This reality has caused builders to spend more than @ MONEY1 to modify the building. Although the builders were able to rectify the frame of the building, subsequent obstacles could not be overcome. After the Hindenburg crash in 1937, "the owners of the Empire @ CAPS1 Building realized how much worse this accident could have been" if the airship had exploded over New York City. The safety of the city has become a concern. Until airships were less flammable, it was not plausible to risk housing them in densely populated areas. The last obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was "nature itself". The strong winds that lashed the 101st and 102nd floors would spin the airships around the mooring mast. It was "neither practical nor safe". Overall, the obstacles encountered by the builders proved fatal to the success of the mooring mast.             

<START>

 

Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the roof of the Empire State Building, as that would add strain to the building's frames. They therefore had to modify the framework of the building to strengthen them. In addition, most airships instead use hydrogen which is highly flammable and destroys a population of New York. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting and the stern of the airship circled around the mooring mast, making it unsafe for pedestrians below. Finally, another reason that airships could not dock with the building was that there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas.     

<START>

 

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the @ CAPS1 faces huge obstacles when trying to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building. First of all "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself" The reason is that "the winds at the top of the building were always changing due to the purple drafts" " Even if the airship was attached it would whirl around "" Also it would be hanging over pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe "It would be really dangerous if they did the docking at the top of the building. These are the obstacles encountered by manufacturers.    

<START>

 

In the clip, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in order for the airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was that the building with a mooring mast at the top attached by a cable to an airship " would add stress to the structure of the building ". Another obstacle was fixing the structure of the building so that it could support the mast.    

<START>

 

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2, the author described the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. An architect named Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York who spearheaded efforts to build the Empire State Building after his years in power. He imagined that the top of the building was a “ higher call ”. He imagined it being equipped for an era of transportation that was then the only dream of the pioneers of aviation. It seemed possible to him, until the obstacles presented themselves. The first obstacle that struck was the lack of a suitable zone in New York. They should clean up about four blocks in the busy city! Empire State Building architects and engineers consulted with experts, but it didn't plan too well. More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the framework of the buildings. The building would now have 102 floors, with a glazed observation area on the 101st floor. In the end, the biggest obstacle was just nature itself.            

<START>

 

An idea @ CAPS1- @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 to moor an airship at the top of the Empire State Building didn't seem so @ CAPS1- @ CAPS2 in 1929. Realizing the idea of placing a mooring mast at the top of the building thousand feet, the problems quickly arose. The first problem encountered by the architects was the construction of the building itself. The Empire State Building was never built to hold a thousand foot airship. The additional weight would accentuate the frame of the building. To solve this problem, Al Smith, the governor of New York with four terms, has put in place a "quick fix". Smith invested sixty thousand dollars in building support for the buildings. Even with the strengthened framework, security was still a main conflict that put the idea aside. Along with the structural hazard, hydrogen was a primary source of weight reduction for airships. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable. Was the idea worth putting thousands of lives on the line because of the blimp explosion? The people of New York were unwilling to relive the Hindenburg fiasco right above their heads. The last major conflict in Smith's idea was nature itself. Air currents are an uncontrollable force of nature, especially a thousand feet above the ground. Even if strapped, an airship would rotate too @ CAPS1 to be considered safe. The idea presented itself as inconceivable. A pole has been placed on top of the Empire State Building, and the 102nd floor does exist. Both features of these buildings are out of use, which is dangerous for the public.

In the attempt to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles. Often times, something is predicted to work much easier than it actually does, which is exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt " The stress of the airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below." The Empire State Building's steel frame would need to be altered and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. " For the builders, it was quite a project and it took a tremendous amount of time and effort. Plus, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. "Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. It was a huge obstacle that got in the way of their plan. “The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.” Changing winds due to strong drafts were also a huge problem. All of these things contributed to the mooring mast never being successful.      

<START>

 

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to build a mast to moor the airships. One of the main reasons the mast was never built was for safety. Most foreign airships ran on hydrogen, and the builders didn't want to risk another Hindenburg crash in heavily populated New York City. Nature has also restricted the construction of a dock. The winds atop the Empire State Building were constantly changing due to strong drafts, another threat the builders didn't want to risk. Finally, there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. There were many reasons the mast was never built, including safety concerns, nature, and an existing law that prohibited air travel over the city. Ultimately however, building an airship mast was neither practical nor safe, and the project was eventually scrapped.       

<START>

 

Docking airships wouldn't be good at all if they were docked atop the Empire State Building. One of the reasons to dock an airship at the top of the building is that most airships that would come to this dock from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and after the explosion of the Hindenburg it would be too dangerous to have airships filled with hydrogen in a densely populated area like New York. Another obstacle encountered was a climate problem. It was the biggest problem. " The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents " (paragraph @ NUM1). If the winds were this fast, the stern of the airship would sway freely. This could potentially cause danger if the rear strikes a nearby building or starts to get out of control and pull away from the building. The last problem in history is that mooring an airship would be against the law. The existing law stipulated that an airship could not fly low over urban areas. If the airship could dock at the Empire State Building, it would be too low above an urban area. This made it impossible for the Empire State Building to have a dock for airships.           

<START>

 

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were difficult because they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, which passed down to the foundation of the building. Which was almost eleven hundred feet lower. The Empire State Building's metal frame would also have to be modified and reinforced to accommodate this new situation. And more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications must be made to the frame of the building. Building itself the rocket-shaped capital mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm.

In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. According to the excerpt, the author states that " the biggest reason was security ." The airship was using highly flammable hydrogen and they couldn't risk it in such a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the wind and nature itself. In the excerpt it was written "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts." This created another security problem. The wind would sway the airship back and forth, and if they used weights to weigh down the back, it would be dangerous to hang over pedestrians. The author explained how "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was never intended to serve its purpose." This being because it was simply not practical or secure.         

<START>

 

The problems that the builders encountered while trying to build the Empire State Building were, first of all, the airship would have to be attached to the mast and the single cable tie "would constrain the frame of the building ." In paragraph @ NUM1, the author says that the wind pressure and the weight of the airship could not be supported by the current foundation and therefore the frame would have to be strengthened and changed. The last problem was when "Columbia" delivered the newspaper to the Empire State Building. Mooring equipment was not installed due to previous issues with the design, laws and common sense used in the construction of this vessel. The rest of the issues had to do with forgetting about reality due to the real efficiency of the building.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles. One of the hurdles that the builders faced was safety, as they were trying to build a mooring mast at the top of the building for airships to stop and refuel, etc. If the builders did this, it would have been a safety concern. Marcia Lüsted writes that "most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." It could be a huge problem if it exploded in New York, many lives would be in danger. Another obstacle that the builders encountered was strength, because since the mooring mast was going to be used for airships, "a single tether cable would add stress to the structure of the building." This stress from the load of the airships would add stress to the building framing, so the steel framing of the Empire State Building had to be altered and reinforced.      

<START>

 

The @ CAPS1 who made the mooring mast faced many obstacles while trying to moor the airships. Some were sure, nature itself and pre-existing laws. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." The biggest obstacle was nature. The winds at the top were always changeable and could cause airships to crash against the mast. An existing law prevented airships from flying too low in urban cities. Despite all the work that the @ CAPS1 put in the mast, it was never able to reach its potential.      

<START>

 

The Empire State Building was not a good place to tie up an airship. One of the reasons it never worked was security concerns. In all countries except @ PERSON1, airships used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and should not be transported over a densely populated area. Another obstacle that architects should face is the wind speed at this height. The constantly changing winds would force the airship to be strapped in front and back. Then they had to make sure the mooring mast was high enough to surpass the law prohibiting low-level flying over urban areas. The biggest problem was how they never finished their plans. Even after @ NUM1 dollars in modifications, the building was not finished.        

<START>

 

The @ CAPS1 that the Empire State Building builders faced when trying to dock all the airships is that they @ CAPS2 cannot go through an upper part of the building, they have to put it room by room, or the building will become stressed to the point where he might collapse.

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the airships to dock on the mast. For example, when the builder decided to build the mast, he knew that it couldn't just be placed on the roof. It had to be attached somehow to the foundation of the building, as the airship would " add stress to the frame of the building ." In addition, after the Hindenburg disaster, manufacturers realized that the hydrogen inside the airship "is highly flammable". If an airship were to explode over New York City, it would kill not only the people in the airship, but also on the ground. Finally, the biggest obstacle of the mooring mast "was nature itself". The winds at the top of the building are very strong and would have swirled around the mast. The many obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building never allowed any airship to land there.         

<START>

 

When building a large task, there are many obstacles that must be faced. For the builders of the Empire State Building, it was about mooring airships, or airships. One was security. The builders had to make sure it was safe to moor on and off the airship, and it was safe to fly. "Most airships outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." People would not be safe on an airship that could explode at any time. Another obstacle that the builders had to face was the construction of the mooring mast itself for the mooring. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." The airship could not hold onto the mast properly and it would move too much. It wasn't safe or practical for anyone. These are obstacles that many builders face, but the Empire State Building overcame them well.          

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, but overlooked potential problems with their design. A very big issue they faced was security. After the Hindenburg, a German airship, exploded in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a bigger problem if it had exploded in New York. Nature was also a problem. The air currents could cause the airship to sway violently at the top of the building. And finally, they couldn't attempt this because it was illegal. Ships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to an existing law. All of this made it much more difficult to put up a pole on the Empire State Building.       

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced construction, safety, and nature barriers that prevented airships from docking there. These airships or airships were large balloons capable of carrying passengers but required a large landing area. In order for airships to be used as a form of transportation, architects had to design a suitable mooring mast. However, the weight and pressure of an airship on a mast would put a great strain on the frame of the building. The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with producing " over sixty thousand dollars in modifications " to the building's frame. Not only was attempting to moor airships there to be labor intensive and very costly, the builders also faced safety concerns. As the German airship "Hindenburg" experienced, airships that use hydrogen are "highly flammable". If an incident were to occur above the Empire State Building in New York City involving an airship, it would affect the huge population of the area killing so many lives. Flying too low over the city was another security challenge that a law would make illegal and unsuccessful for the use of airships. Finally, nature was an obstacle encountered by builders to moor airships. At the moment of the mast, the "strong winds" would cause the stern of the ship to pivot, which could cause it to strike sharp arrows and be punctured. Lead weights were also not secure when hung over pedestrians. These obstacles made it difficult to create equipment that would allow airships to dock on the vessel.

According to @ ORGANIZATION1's The Mooring Mast excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges as they had high hopes of creating the tallest building in the world. They added hundreds of feet for airships to dock there. Competing with the Chrysler Building, Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building will reach 1,250 feet, beating the Chrysler Building by @ NUM1 feet. Al Smith was desperate to do whatever he could to build the tallest building in the world, even to create a landing point for airships. The idea for @ ORGANIZATION2 did not work as expected. Instead, the @ CAPS1 assigned to airship passengers has been transformed into the tallest soda fountain and tea garden in the world.     

<START>

 

@ ORGANIZATION2's "The Mooring Mast" is a story that guides the reader through the obstacles and attempts that builders face when attempting to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. Al Smith, governor of New York for four terms, planned to build the Empire State Building after his tenure. Smith was competitive and realized that the building was on the verge of winning the title of tallest building in the world. So in 1929 he announced that the building would measure 1,250 feet and he would do so by adding a top or hat to the building that would be distinctive. The idea was to add a mooring mass and observation decks at the top and to be able to moor airships or airships. The architects later realized that a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building held by a cable tie would add stress to the building's framing. The stress of loading an airship with the pressure of the wind would go all the way to the foundation of the building. The plans that made the builders work so hard on the frames and observation decks failed. It was not practical to moor an airship, it would not be safe. In the late 1930s the idea was scrapped, but the Empire State Building is still open to one of the viewing platforms and is a very popular attraction in New York City.

In the days of the Empire State Building and its fame at height, it was @ CAPS1 Al Smith who faced more than one obstacle to complete the mooring mast. From the start of its construction, the mooring mast was not properly thought out and did not have the right design. Al Smith realized this even before finalizing the construction process. Once he finally finished the mooring mast, he encountered some obstacles. The airships had problems mooring, due to the wind and the elements, the airships had difficulty staying stationary when moored. Another hurdle was fuel, due to the recent Hindenburg crash, airships had to be powered by helium rather than the more flammable hydrogen. Finally, existing laws prohibiting airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas caused the mooring mast to fail. Eventually, the planes took the position of the airships and the mooring mast was removed. Due to these obstacles, Al Smith gave up the mooring mast but still helped the tallest building record.        

<START>

 

One obstacle that the builders had to face was the amount of wind that was blowing this high in the air. The airships were so big that the wind had a lot of resistance on them and caused them to sway from behind. Another obstacle was that the airships were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable being filled with a gas so flammable that it could easily turn into a disaster. Especially with all the people who were so close to her on the pitch.

While building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered a few obstacles. One obstacle they faced was that they couldn't just "leave a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building." @ CAPS1, they had to do work on the building, so that it could take care of it. As @ CAPS2 said, "The Empire State Building's steel frame should be altered and reinforced to accommodate the new situation." Another obstacle that the builders faced was that if there was an accident, like the Hindenburg, it would be much more dangerous, as there would be many more people nearby, who could be injured by the fire. “The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,” @ CAPS2 said. Wind currents above the building shifted due to " strong air currents ". Also, airships must have weights attached to the back of them, but at the Empire State Building those weights would be suspended above pedestrians ... neither practical nor safe. ”The other hurdle was that the airships couldn't get close enough. to the mast, because of the wind, like the Los Angeles. Due to all these obstacles, the mooring mast has not been used since.

The Empire State Building workers attempted to build an airship pier atop the tallest building in the world, but many issues arose in the process. In order to have an airship dock on top of the building, the building would have to support its weight. "The Empire State Building's steel framing would have to be altered and reinforced to accommodate this situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of alterations had to be made to the building framing." (@ CAPS2 @ NUM1) "The 102-story building was to be a success and become the new era of aviation travel. Another hurdle workers faced was realizing that the airships outside the @ CAPS1 were highly flammable because they contain hydrogen “ The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. ” (@ CAPS2 @ NUM2). ” There are very strong and violent winds at the top of the building the airship could become a danger if it got out of control An airship hovering over hundreds of pedestrians in New York City is a definite danger. There is also a law prohibiting aircraft from flying at low altitudes above populated areas Having a mooring dock was a good idea but it was never really practical or safe, a lot of bad things could have happened if it actually worked.

There were many obstacles that the builders had to face in attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building, but there were a few major ones. The first major obstacle was that a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame. So with that, they still couldn't put the mooring mast on top of the building until they made some major adjustments. With this big deal, the builders' next hurdle was to design and build a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a recessed design that mimicked the general shape of the building itself. -same. The last small hurdle the builders faced was that the mast also had a steel skeleton and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows that needed to be built and put in place. These were some of the obstacles that builders faced when trying to put a mooring mast on the Empire State Building.     

<START>

 

The hurdles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were the docking itself, the nature and overall construction of those airships. So there was a law against these air vessels. Docking the airships atop the Empire State Building would add a great deal of stress to the building. Builders are expected to spend sixty thousand dollars on modifications to the entire building. The biggest safety issue was building these balloons from outside the United States. They were using hydrogen which was highly flammable, there was an incident on May 6, 1937 where German airships caught fire. This is called the Hindenburg accident. The builders knew this could endanger the densely populated area of New York. But the biggest obstacle was nature itself. When the airships docked, strong air currents would rotate the stern of the airship around the mooring mast. The law against airships was that they were not allowed to fly at low altitudes around urban areas.         

<START>

 

When constructing the Empire State Building, the @ CAPS1 wanted it to remain the tallest in New York. They modified the buildings so that it was not replaced by the chrystler building. Its original property was not to be a mooring mast. The Empire State Building had to be cropped, then the government banned planes that were too low, then commercial airliners took over the aviation industry. It was too dangerous for the airships to moor because the strong currents can displace them and cause accidents similar to those in the Hindinburg.

In the clip, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, builders face many obstacles when constructing an airship dock atop the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the height of the building. This lies more frame, more material, more safety risks, all because of the height of the buildings. Another obstacle was the security of @ ORGANIZATION3. Having already built a safer building, workers realized that " a densely populated area like downtown New York " would not be the best place to be in the event of an accident, " the biggest obstacle. to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. " Nature played a big role in an obstacle as it would always be unpredictable. The winds also wiped the stern of the airship, making it dangerous and unstable for the passengers These are some of the obstacles that the builders had to face in the construction of the famous mooring mast.

When building the Empire State Building, people had to overcome certain obstacles to have it the way they wanted. They wanted airships to be able to land / border on the Empire State Building. One of those obstacles was the use in New York and the lack of a suitable landing zone. The other obstacle was good. The use of airships for the mooring mast has been successful.    

<START>

 

Based on The Mooring Mast article, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in trying to allow airships to dock there, such as lack of a landing pad, practicality and safety. The lack of a landing zone was one of the challenges. "The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone." Since no airship could land on the Empire State Building without a bit of fish and landing space, this was a challenge that the builders of the building faced. Another challenge was to make the dock practical, "a group of engineers here in New York are trying to boost a practical and workable arrangement ...". This shows that a practical arrangement of the conversation was made yet again, and so this was another challenge that the builders faced. Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with safety concerns, ".... are looking for a safe way to moor airships to this mast" - this indicates that mooring airship safety does has not yet been uncertain, that it was still a challenge that builders faced Overall, Empire State Building builders faced challenges such as lack of landing zones, practicality and security.

While allowing airships to dock atop the Empire State Building seems like a good idea, it wasn't. There are many obstacles preventing it from happening. With " an airship @ DATE1 ft moored to the top of the building held by a single tether cable, this would add constraints to the building's frame " (paragraph @ NUM1). Also one of the biggest obstacles like high winds which change constantly due to strong air currents. In addition, the airship would be suspended above pedestrians on the street, which is not certain. The biggest hurdle was the fact that it is illegal for airships to fly low over urban areas, which would also make it illegal for the airship to attach to the building or even approach it. It sounds like a great idea and a great way to attract more tourists, but there are too many obstacles for it to be realistic.        

<START>

 

According to "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced three main obstacles in attempting to allow the airships to dock. The first obstacle was concern for public safety. Airships coming from outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable element. An accident in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic. The second obstacle was the strong winds at the top of the building. Using lead weights to tie up the airships was impractical, as they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street. One incident would send these heavyweights flying away and causing destruction. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made the idea of allowing airships to dock at the Empire State Building illegal and out of the question.

According to the excerpt, builders encountered many obstacles to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building. As in paragraph @ NUM1 "the biggest reason was security". The biggest problem was that the airships used hydrogen which was very flamibal. An accident would have been tragic due to the busy downtown @ CAPS1. Nature also proposed a big obstacle "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts." @ CAPS2 there was a law prohibiting airships from flying at low altitude over urban areas.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" by @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle that prevented airships from docking to the Empire State Building was the use of hydrogen rather than helium in airships coming from the United States. This was a problem because hydrogen is very flammable. When the German airship was destroyed in New Jersey, the architects of the Empire State Building realized how dangerous it was. Another obstacle encountered by manufacturers was the weather. The weather conditions affected the use of the mooring mast as " the winds at the top of the vessel were constantly shifting due to strong air currents ". One practical reason the mooring mast couldn't moor airships to the Empire State Building was the Airship Law. The law stated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a ship to tie up to a building. These are just a few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building that prevented the use of the mooring mast.

In theory, the idea of creating a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was a great idea. However, in reality, it did not go so well. There are many reasons why an airship couldn't be docked to the Empire State Building. For example : " Most airships coming from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium " (paragraph @ NUM1) It was dangerous because hydrogen is extremely flammable, and if for a Reason for any accident to happen, it could be catastrophic on a densely populated city like New York. Perhaps the most dangerous obstacle was the climate around the Empire State Building. There is a strong, constant wind that moves a lot due to all of the different drafts created by the building. If an airship docked there, it would blow all over the place, if it could even dock there. Most of the airships moored in open fields were weighted down at the stern, but it would be too dangerous to attempt above a bustling city. Finally, there was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas ... that would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area." (paragraph @ NUM2).

The Empire State Building's mooring mast was never intended to serve its purpose. In the short clip from "The Mooring Mast by @ ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles made clear as to why the mast was not a good idea. Construction of the mast was rushed. Al Smith had realized he was on the point of losing the title of the tallest building in the world and quickly thought of the mast. Problems soon arose. The first problem that arose was the lack of a suitable landing pad. Al Smith has stated that passengers could safely sway in the breeze. This problem was ignored and soon other problems arose as the mast was being built. The biggest problem that should have been thought of before building the mast was nature itself. The winds were horrible at the height of the building and the architects soon realized that the landing would be a major problem. The mast was still questioned and the architects and engineers were doing whatever they could to make it work until something was forced upon them, a law. It is illegal for airships to fly too low over an urban area. The law that was re alized marked the end of Al Smith's idea and by the end of the 1930s the idea of using the mooring mast for airships and their passengers quietly faded away.

The Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. Airships are airships. The first obstacle for the Empire State Building with just the size. The Empire State Building was very competitive with the Chrysler Building. Some opinions were "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was built. There was also the obstacle to their expanded use in New York City. was the lack of a proper landing area. They added a mooring mast. There was a lot of trials and tribulations making the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented airships from docking there. One obstacle was the original design of the Empire State Building. It was to be completely modified to accommodate the landing airships: "The stress of the airship's load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. steel of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation "(@ NUM1). Over sixty thousand dollars was spent on renovations to the redesigned chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. Another obstacle that manufacturers faced was the level of safety. Thousands of lives could have been lost if an airship accident had occurred in New York: “When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how this accident could have happened if it had taken place over a densely populated area like downtown New York "(@ NUM2). By far the biggest obstacle was the . elements airships easily swayed by bad weather : " the winds atop the building were constantly changing because of the violent air currents While the blimp was attached to the mooring mast, aft pivoterait around. and around the mast mooring "(@ NUM3). It was very dangerous due to the density of the population in New York. If an airship circled too far around the mooring mast, it could strike another building or crash. The people behind the construction of the Empire State Building encountered many difficulties, which is why the mooring mast was never used.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was to rebuild the frame of the buildings. This had to be done so that the building could withstand large amounts of wind pressure and stress from the airship. The next problem encountered by the workers was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building that if an airship was moored to the mooring mast it would rotate around it according to the wind currents. The last problem the architects faced was a law against the height of an airship. There was already a law that stated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were just a few of the many obstacles faced by the Empire State Building construction crew.

In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The builders didn't think about what would happen to airships if something went wrong. Also on the height of the Empire State Building. The first hurdle the builder faced when building the Empire State Building was whether anything was happening to the airships. For example, what if airships are highly flammable like the Hindenburg. The second obstacle that the builders faced was the height they achieved due to its height, the wind current was very strong. In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. They tried to defeat them but there were too many.

Obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock have had consequences. One of the barriers to increased use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Also, architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roofs of Empire State buildings, as a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add constraints to the structure of the building. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents. The last obstacle that airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. The US Navy Los Angeles airship approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to moor due to high winds

The architects and builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Some of their issues included the structure of the building, wind and weather conditions, and the safety of their passengers. The Empire State Building's metal frame would have to be modified and reinforced to accommodate the new situation. The building now had 102 floors and contained a stainless steel frame. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. The stern of the ship would pivot and would need lead weights to hold it in place. It was clearly seen as dangerous. Finally, the safety of the passengers was at stake because the complete mooring equipment of the airship was never installed. In addition, there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the reasons the airships never docked on the Empire State Building due to the many obstacles.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems with their idea of mooring airships atop the Empire State Building. A major obstacle was the aircraft-based laws. a law @ CAPS1 prohibits aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Another issue that manufacturers faced was the safety risks of mooring airships. The airships were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flammable gas, and after the accident with the explosion of the German airship Hindenburg, the builders realized the risk of accidents. Mother Nature @ CAPS2 the biggest obstacle across, the height of the Empire State Building causes high speed winds that would throw the end of any airship around the mooring like a rag doll. The manufacturers then realized all the risks associated with mooring airships and abandoned the idea.

The Empire State Building was the building designed to be the tallest building in the world. With that, Governor Al Smith wanted the building to be more than decorative, as he says in his comments in paragraph 3. Al Smith wanted the Empire State Building to be outfitted for an era of transportation. He wanted to create the last attraction for airships. This should allow airships to dock there. yet, allowing this, they did not know that the builders would face obstacles. With the idea of airships, Al Smith saw a great opportunity. When asked about the mooring mast idea, AL Smith said, "It's on level, okay. No kidding. We were working on the thing now." Although the Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, as explained in paragraph three.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author describes the many challenges that architects faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The architects had new challenges that seemed almost impossible to avoid at times. The height of the building, the weight of the airship against the building, and the fact that airships are highly flammable all add to the many obstacles that architects faced. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. Unpredictable winds meant airships could be blown into a building at any time. There was even a law against it which "would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the building or even approach the area" (para @ NUM1). Another problem encountered by architects was the high flammability of airships. Airships made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another airship caught fire, people realized how "this accident could have been worse if it had happened over a densely populated area like downtown New York" ( para @ NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the airships on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that " the stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundations of the buildings " (para @ NUM3). They knew it was very dangerous for the unloading passengers and for the people in the building. Overall, the issues and challenges that the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome.

The engineers and builders of the Empire State Building certainly faced significant and overwhelming complications when they tried to build it to allow the mooring of airships or airships. First of all, from their original plan, they had to modify the building from the get-go, as they discovered that another building's actual height was higher. so they had to find something quickly to solve this problem. Second, after the Hindenburg disaster, @ LOCATION1 realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against that, so the whole idea was thrown out. To make matters worse, the strong gusts of air and updrafts would not make docking at the Empire State Building very safe for passengers.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The excerpt "The Mooring @ CAPS1" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains some of the problems that architect Al Smith encountered during the construction of the tallest building in the world in the 1920s. For example, " The most important problem was that of security ”. Safety was a major obstacle because most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If an airship were to explode over this densely populated area, scores of people would be killed or seriously injured. Another obstacle encountered in this attempt was "nature itself". Nature was one of the many major issues for an airship to dock. For example, " the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents ." The winds would move the vessel and it would be very difficult to land on the mooring mast. The other practical problem encountered by the manufacturers was "a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas". The whole idea was finally abandoned in the late 1930s. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when creating the " Mooring Mast ".

When building a mooring mast, @ CAPS1 encountered many problems. Security was the main issue / concern they encountered. Since most of the airships outside @ LOCATION1 were hydrogen and not helium, they were highly flammable. After the Hindenburg airship was destroyed by fire, the residents of @ CAPS1 feared it could happen through the Empire State Building. Another problem they encountered was the law. At that time, it was against the law to fly an airship this low over urban areas. During the tests, some airships could not get close enough because of the strong winds. It made it impossible to tie up airships and let people go. It also made people fear that the wind would blow the airship on sharp parts of another building, which would cause a hole in the airship. It was a good idea, but there were just too many. obstacles they had to bypass to get the airship docking station and mooring mast.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was the strong drafts that were at the top of the building. Even if the airships docked successfully at the top of the building, the rear of the building would struggle with the wind. If this were to happen and the airship got out of control, it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the New @ CAPS1s in downtown are walking. Putting weights on the end of the airship would help this situation, but as @ CAPS2 says, "airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire. State Building, where they would hang high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. " Another problem that manufacturers faced was the fact that airships were highly flammable. They learned their lesson and got it into their heads that their idea might not be so good after the destruction of the German airship, the Hindenburg.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. The author tells us readers that airships were in fact huge steel-framed balloons. with cotton cloth envelopes filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. While the builders tried to knock a mooring mast over the flat roof of the Empire State Building. In the excerpt tells us the reader that "a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building. The stress of the airship load and the pressure of the airship. wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Although the airship is as light as air, it could spoil the frame of the building. Another obstacle that builders have had to deal with. had to face was when the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire at @ LOCATION1, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The owner of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident would have been in New Jersey. York, as a populated city like downtown. "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."

The builders faced many obstacles when trying to get the Airships to dock with the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles was nature. The winds atop the Empire State Building were still swirling due to the strong drafts. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot. Another obstacle faced by manufacturers was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a "ship to tie up to or even approach a vessel.

From the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' from @ ORGANIZATION2, we see that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. Their first hurdle was figuring out how to transfer " the stress of airship load and pressure winds " to building foundations. Another was to modify the steel frame of the building and reinforce it to accommodate the situation of adding the mooring mast. So the builders changed the building and assigned it a mooring mast, but when the construction was completed, the builder encountered another obstacle. " Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a hazard if there is one igniting above from New York. The biggest obstacle with the winds. They were constantly moving which made it difficult for any airship to even get close to the mast, even if they could reach the mast, the rear of airships would pivot around the mast where in open fields the airships would be ballasted with weight lead. it was neither practical nor safe. Due to all the obstacles the mooring mast would never be used

The main obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were from the wrong location. The airships moored 1,250 feet above one of the busiest cities in the world. This would create three problems for mooring airships. The first problem is that hydrogen is used in airships and is extremely flammable. If an airship were to explode over downtown New York City, scores of people would be killed. This means that not many people will want airships to dock there. If the Empire State Building hadn't been on top of such a densely populated area, they might not have had this problem. The next difficulty would be the fact that at this altitude in New York there are strong wind currents that are constantly changing. This makes it difficult for the drivers to tie up the airship and it could also cause the airship to hit something and burst. Once again, the airship falls in downtown New York and kills many people. This is another reason it was a bad location. It must have been in a place where there were more stable wind currents. The final hurdle was that there was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This meant that even if the other factor went away, there was a law builders should have known about that banned their plans. As the author said, the Empire State Building was never destined to serve its purpose.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow airships to dock there. If they were to succeed, they would have become a major aeronautical fixture for transatlantic routes and new routes to come. In order to allow airships to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast had to be constructed and placed at the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was not an easy task. The framework of the Empire State Building had to be modified to be able to withstand the stresses of the airship mounted on the mooring mast. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framing. With the framing adjusted, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from within. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed. After the roof was built, the mooring mast was added with its own steel skeleton. After the entire project was completed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that mooring the airships would be far too dangerous. After all of the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. For example, one of the hurdles they faced was that "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." This is important because it would be dangerous for foreign airships to dock on the Empire State Building, especially in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle they faced was nature. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts." This suggests that an airship would rotate and could be ballasted with lead weights, using them at the Empire State Building, high above pedestrians on the street, would be impractical and dangerous. Then there was also “an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas”. This is important as it is another obstacle that would ultimately make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Further, "in December 1930, the United States Navy airship Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to moor because of the high winds." This shows that another obstacle they may have faced was loss of confidence and the direct observation that their plan would not work. The various obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there show that it would have been a difficult task to accomplish.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles to allow airships to dock there. One of the main obstacles was the lack of a good landing zone. The airships were big enough and there wasn't a good place for them. "Some were up to a thousand feet long, the same length as blocks of flour in New York" - paragraph 6. therefore caused problems for builders to know where to put them.

According to the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many factors prevented the airships from docking at the mooring mast. When the German airship "Hindenburg" caught fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized, citing how much worse the crash could have been had it occurred in a densely populated area like the downtown core. -City of New York. "(paragraph @ NUM1). Another obstacle was the existing law against low-flying airships in urban areas. This law makes it" illegal for a ship to dock to the building or even to approach the area "(paragraph @ NUM2) The biggest obstacle of all, however, was nature. The winds so high in the sky were" constantly shifted due to strong drafts " All of these factors contributed to the project never happening in New York.

In a competition with the architect building the Chrysler Building, Al Smith wanted to build a taller building with a purpose. This purpose would be to moor the airships on a mooring mast. It seemed like a good idea, to take a very popular and new mode of transport and allow it to go around New York City. Then their problems arose, at first the architects knew that "a thousand foot airship moored at the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building". So with the time they had they assumed they had fixed the problem, but when it was finished the architects knew that "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was meant to serve its purpose. .. "Most problems do not have. It doesn't stem from the building, but the practicality of having an airship pitch in a large, crowded city, like the highly flammable hydrogen that fills most airships or the proximity of other buildings to airships, could cause them to burn. All in all, the idea was good in theory, but could never be carried out. Only two airships have been moored there and it has never been used since

Although the builders struggled to make their dream come true, a few obstacles stood in the way. The main obstacles encountered by manufacturers were the weather, the law and safety concerns. The weather at the top of the building was very windy and strong winds would pose major problems for the airships to land. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, no airship would even be allowed to fly near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was security concerns. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, has been used in many foreign airships. It could cause disaster if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where "the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 ..." These obstacles weren't just the ones that builders could ignore, and they ultimately completely prevented the intended use.

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were. one was the existing law against airships flying low over urban areas. Stated in @ CAPS1 @ NUM1. Another obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. With the airship moored to the top of the building held by a tether cable, it would have put a strain on the building, so they would have had to reinforce the structure of the building.

The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building were that they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This is because it would have added a lot of stress to the Empire State Building's frame, which could have caused the collapse over a period of time. Thus, the metal frame of the Empire State Building had to be "modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation", as the extract says. Once the builders finished building the Empire State Building up to the eighty-fifth floor, it was now time to frame the roof to create an area where the mooring mast would be placed. Once the workers finished the roof frame, they built the mooring mast there, now the builders had to face the challenge of framing the mooring mass. The builders framed the mooring mast with a steel skeleton. Builders faced these challenges by attempting to allow derilibles to dock on the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. The first hurdle they had to overcome was that if an airship, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was docked at the top of the building, it would add stress to the structure of the building. This meant that the steel frame of the building had to be reinforced and modified to cope with the additional stresses. The cost of the modifications amounted to over sixty thousand dollars. The following challenge was discovered after the building was completed. It was the fact that having airships docked at the Empire State Building was dangerous. This first reason it is dangerous is that most airships, not the United States, use hydrogen in helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant that an accident like the one in the Hindenburg could happen over the densely populated downtown New York. Another issue that arose after construction was that the changing winds at the top of the building were too strong for the airship, which swiveled around the mooring mast. All of these challenges, along with an existing law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, were obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and that is why only one airship was docked there. .

Challenges can be met when radical ideas are implemented. Faced with the task of mooring airships, or zeppelins, to the top of the Empire State Building, builders have encountered challenges that are natural to come with new ideas. One challenge included was the fact that the wind from such an altitude as the Empire State Building made situations perilous for airships and people on the ground. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). Another obstacle faced by builders was difficulties with United States government laws. "The other practical reason why airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas."

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempted to allow the airships to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that airships were dangerous when not handled properly. If it did, many people could die because it was in a densely populated area. In paragraph @ NUM1, the author states, “Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. @ CAPS1 was also a problem to allow airships to dock there; the wind at this height was very strong and would become a problem. In paragraph @ NUM2, the author states regarding the wind : “ Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast. " Another obstacle was laws banning too low airships flying over urban areas. The paragraph @ NUM3 states: "This law would make it illegal for a ship to moor at the building or even at a production area ..." @ CAPS2, all these obstacles ultimately made it impossible to moor airships to the Empire State building.

The builders of the mooring mast plan the construction well, but did not consider the potential risks of the mast. One of the reasons the mast's fate was sealed was security concerns. Most airships, or airships, used hydrogen rather than helium. If any of these airships fell from the sky, many people below would be killed. New York has a lot of people walking all over the place. Builders also had to take into account the strong winds at such a high altitude. These winds could carry the airships, making it difficult to keep them in one place for passengers to board and refuel. The winds are constantly changing. They could detonate the airships on the arrows of the Empire State Building, causing them to explode and fall to the ground below. Unfortunately, there is a law that prevents airships from flying too low over urban areas. "It would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the building or even approach the area." I think Al Smith was more focused on keeping his height record than on the potential dangers of the mast.

In "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State Building is familiar to many people around the world, but few know that the mast's original purpose was to serve as a landing point for airships, too. known as airships. . Facing the hurdles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there, they ultimately gave up on the idea. One of the obstacles that the builders realized was that if a foreign airship were to dock and crash with heat or a spark, they would explode and fall to the ground, killing many men, women and children, due to the chemicals. which are used on foreign airships. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." @ CAPS1, another obstacle they faced with high winds, which would knock over the airships. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts."

In history, construction workers faced a problem. The idea of having an airship dock above the Empire State Building was drawing to a close. Thinking about the idea of architecture Never put the thought into legal persasures as in airplanes cannot fly low over urban areas. In addition, the strong wind that rises from the building makes the aircraft difficult to control. Another was the dangers they could inflict on civilians. If not @ CAPS1 correctly, the aircraft may detach and move in urban areas or as the German airship catch fire and explode. Even though they had a working prototype, they cut the project off by giving planes the best way to travel through the air.

There is more than one hurdle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The biggest obstacle was nature.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when attempting to allow airships (airships) to dock there. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. With high winds and a changeable climate, it was extremely difficult to tie the airships to the mooring mast. The other main reason airships could not dock at the Empire State Building was the current law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. Airships will never be moored to the moor as this will break the law. Safety was also one of the main reasons airships could not be tethered to the moor. The airships outside of @ LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to fill their airships. Since hydrogen is highly flammable, people feared that if it caught fire above a busy city like New York City, hell would break loose. These are just a few examples of the struggles facing the builders of the Empire State Building.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's article The Mooring Mast, the architects of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. First there was the obvious concern, safety, an airship hanging over New York City doesn't seem very safe. And it wasn't a reasonable thing to build @ CAPS1, the Empire State Building was big enough already, why build a mast that probably won't get much use anyway.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The builders wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building, to allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling, or service, they couldn't do that because "a thousand foot airship moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tie would add stress to the structure of the building. ” Al Smith did not allow airships to land on the building due to the thin roof.   

<START>

 

In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people travel, the idea of mooring has not been thought through as well as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles grew more and more with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast on top of the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was that when an airship was attached to the building it would add stress, "the stress of the load of the airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." Another obstacle encountered by the mooring mast was that of safety. Airships not originating from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Another obstacle to construction was nature itself, with strong and changeable winds due to strong drafts, an airship attached to the mast would rotate around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this. would be to tie the lead weights to the rear, but massive dangling weights, suspended over a thousand feet above the audience, were not the safest idea. A final hurdle that was faced with the fact that there was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These are all hurdles that should have been thought through and realized before construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast began.       

<START>

 

In @ PERSON1's "Mooring Mast", there are many reasons why a suitable and functional mast was not possible. there were natural reasons and there were mechanical reasons. As well as time and safety. Nature played a key role in this project. The winds around the building were "constantly moving" due to the location of the building. When the airships to tried to approach to test it, one was too unstable to moor and the other through paper along a rope "after this stunt, the idea of the mooring mast has been abandoned ". @ CAPS1 has replaced airships over time and airships when they are flammable and dangerous. In addition, flying at this height is illegal.       

<START>

 

When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast above the Empire State Building, they encountered big problems, which led to complications when mooring airships. One of the factors was that, by law, airships could not be so low above the city because they could accidentally crash into a building and fall into the crowd below. Another factor was the drafts around tall buildings, especially the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the winds would shake it violently and could crash into the building and fall into the streets below. A recent factor arose when the Hindenburg airship caught fire from the hydrogen it contained when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. No one wanted to risk this happening over the air either. New York City. So, due to the flammable hydrogen, strong drafts, and the law, builders had complications when constructing the mooring mast to allow airships to land there.       

<START>

 

Some obstacles were that there were many sharp rods on the surrounding buildings and so if it hit one it could burst. Another is that if the wind is blowing it was difficult / dangerous for the airships to be tied to the building.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. One obstacle being the construction of a frame strong enough for the building so that a derigible of a thousand feet can be held by the single tether cable. Another obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the safety of how most derigibles outside the United States at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which made it very dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. This forced the builders to find a way to create an airstrip where the airship wouldn't hit any of the sharp arrows above the Empire State Building. These were @ NUM1 of the many obstacles that the builders of the Imperial State faced.    

<START>

 

The @ ORGANIZATION2 article The Mooring Mast, "explains the many problems with using the top of the Empire State Building to dock airships. First, airships that were traveling overseas were full of airships. hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. Having another Hindenburg-style disaster over New York City would be very dangerous. Additionally, the winds at the top of the spire change rapidly and are unpredictable, making the approach dangerous. It would be very dangerous. Normally normal for an airship to land in a windy area, as lead weights could be tied to ropes holding the airship down. Without landing on the ground, like just tying to the boom, there was no way weighing down the airship to stabilize it. Finally, a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas, making docking with the Empire State illegal. Many practical reasons have overturned the dreams of docking airships at the Empire State. "

Many of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were that the architect couldn't just drop a docking above the building's flat roof. Like it @ CAPS2 in @ CAPS1 @ NUM1. Also "rather than building a utility mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel that would be stripped from the interior. With a setback to mimic the general shape of the building itself. same." It @ CAPS2 in @ CAPS1 @ NUM2.

According to the excerpt "The @ CAPS1 Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, There were many obstacles to the builders of the @ ORGANIZATION1. To allow airships to moor their. One of their biggest hurdles, the builders @ ORGANIZATION1 was the frame. They had to design it so that the building could withstand the stress of the airship. " The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building ." In order to make it work, they would use a different steel. Another obstacle of the @ ORGANIZATION1 builder would be security. Winds and hydrogen were central concerns. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen, the hydrogen is highly flammable. The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts." They would also watch out for pedestrians "they would swing over pedestrians in the street". These are just two examples of what the builders of the Empire State Building @ ORGANIZATION1.            

<START>

 

The idea of mooring airships on the Empire State Building created a handful of problems. This idea was hardly practical, mainly for security reasons. If an airship were moored there on a cable, extreme stress would be exerted on the vessel. Moreover, if an international airship landed full of highly flammable hydrogen and caught fire, the results would be catastrophic. The task of mooring would also be a problem. With such a high altitude, the winds were very strong. Nothing could stop the airships from swinging around the building. In other situations, the airships would be weighted with weights. However, if these were to fall, they would land on the busy streets of New York City. Finally, there was a law against low-flying air craft, completely rejecting the idea of docking airships on the Empire State Building.                       

<START>

 

While trying to build a dock on top of the Empire State Building for airships, workers encountered many obstacles. One of the reasons is that " the architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building " (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) because it would only be held by " a single cable of attach ”(@ CAPS1. @ NUM1) which would add stress to the building. And the only way to fix it would be to spend "over sixty thousand dollars in modifications" to make it stronger. Another obstacle was "nature itself" (@ CAPS1. @ NUM3). This is because the winds "would constantly change due to strong drafts" (@ CAPS1. @ NUM3). And the only way to solve it would be to put on lead weights to weigh down the back, but that is not "practical or safe". (@ CAPS1. @ NUM3) The last reason is because of the "law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas", so it would make "illegal for a ship to attach to the vessel".

In an attempt to allow airships, also known as zeppelins or airships, to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles along the way. Al Smith said "... the engineers here in New York [are trying] to boost a practical and workable arrangement" (paragraph @ NUM1). First, they wouldn't drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the building. This would add too many constraints to the chassis and would have to be modified to adapt to this new situation "(paragraph @ NUM2). Another obstacle was that most airships apart from @ LOCATION2 use hydrogen, which is very flammable. When the "Hindenburg" was destroyed by fire, "the owners ... realized how much worse it could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area like the city center of New York "(paragraph @ NUM3). The biggest obstacle was" nature itself "(paragraph @ NUM4). Due to the strong drafts," the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving " (paragraph @ NUM4) In open areas, airships could be weighed down by lead weights, but this poses a threat to pedestrians in the street, as the weights would be suspended above them. Finally, there was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas nes ”(paragraph @ NUM6). This law makes docking with the Empire State Building illegal. of the Empire State Building in front of my no obstacle to try to allow the airships to moor there.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced four main issues when trying to allow airships to dock there. One of these issues has been resolved, the other three have not. The first obstacle was that since each airship would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stresses would be exerted on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the framework of the Empire State Building, but the modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars. The second hurdle was not so easily resolved. Airships in other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg airship that caught fire alerted owners and builders of the Empire State Building to the dangerousness of such an accident, especially in the densely populated city of New York. . The third hurdle also proved impossible to solve - due to the high wind speed at the top of the building, there would be no way for an airship to get to @ CAPS1 safely. In the single test, the Los Angeles Navy airship was unable to get close enough to @ CAPS1 due to the high winds. It would have been too easy for the airship to get out of control and hit an arrow on a nearby building. Finally, there was already a law that prevented airships from flying too close to urban areas, which would make @ CAPS1 or piloting a ship in New York illegal.

In @ ORGANIZATION2's The Mooring Mast excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. First, the wind was too fast for the builders at this altitude. This shows that they didn't want airships to fall on the stores below. Second, they didn't complete the building because the building couldn't support all the weight they wanted to put on it. Third, hydrogen is highly flammable and can easily ignite. In short, there were a number of issues that made the Empire State Building a bad idea for mooring an airship.     

<START>

 

During @ DATE1 and the 1930s fierce competition erupted for the construction of the taller building. To differentiate the Empire State Building from the @ ORGANIZATION1 decided to put on a mooring mask for airships. This would both make sense and make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the world. The docking mask was sure to fail for several reasons. On the one hand, foreign airships used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and would cause a huge fire @ CAPS1. Another reason is that above the Empire State Building there are strong winds and currents that are constantly changing. This would make it very difficult to control the airship. Pilots unable to control the airship would have great difficulty @ CAPS2 their airship. Finally the mooring quay failed because of the law. This law stated that it was illegal to fly planes at low altitudes over urban areas. In 1931 @ CAPS3 Clavan @ CAPS4 the @ CAPS5 of the mooring mask. By the end of the 1930s, the Idea was dead.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was the lack of suitable landing zones. They usually land in open fields, where they are ballasted with lead weights. In New York, they would be hung over pedestrians on the street. Another obstacle was security. Most airships use hydrogen, which is highly flammable. They feared an accident like the one in the Hindenburg would happen, but this time it would be over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. The last obstacle was the strong winds. They could detonate the airship on Sharp arrows from other buildings and pierce the shell, the captain could not remove his hands from the control levers. Overall the mooring mast was not a very well thought out idea and it would not have been safe at all.          

<START>

 

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were mainly due to structural and safety issues. According to paragraph @ NUM1, "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame." This problem required over sixty thousand dollars of structural modifications. While structural issues were a problem, pedestrian safety created an even bigger barrier for builders. Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area, such as the downtown area. of New York "(paragraph @ NUM2). Even though the existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas prevented airships from docking with the Empire State Building, the biggest obstacle of all was nature. itself. the shells of airships could be punctured by winds that constantly moving because of strong drafts.     

<START>

 

Builders have faced many obstacles, from laws to future disasters. There were several issues with the design and location of the mooring mast. One of the issues was that “ the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving ”. Even though the architects adjusted the mast design, it was still too dangerous to land with an airship. Another major problem was the airships themselves. They were filled with combustible hydrogen. If an airship caught fire, like the Hindenburg, debris would fall on pedestrians below. The last problem was a law that prevented "airships from flying too low over urban areas." In conclusion, due to laws, airships and nature, the mooring mast was not used.      

<START>

 

The first hurdle is being able to get on and off passengers due to the height they are already at. As also noted in paragraph @ NUM1, "The US Navy Los Angeles airship approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to moor due to high winds." @ CAPS1 so the power of the wind is a huge obstacle. Another obstacle stated in paragraph @ NUM1 "The other practical reason that airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting aerial vessels from flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area. " @ CAPS1 the law was another obstacle they had to face.    

<START>

 

The architects who built the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building had many problems mooring the airships there. When they @ CAPS1 were building, the idea of being able to tie airships to the top of a building was revolutionary and ideal. But they had many issues with security, weather, and the law. A safety concern was that the gas inside airships, hydrogen, is highly flammable. An accident could injure hundreds of people on the streets of New York. The wind at the top of the building was also very strong. It is therefore difficult for any airship to get close enough. the last difficulty the builders had was the laws. Some laws did not allow hovercraft to fly too low over densely populated urban areas. While their mooring mast seemed like a good idea to start with, it was unfortunately never very useful.

Based on the information provided in the excerpt, the obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced were critical to the use of the dock. Not only is it a challenge to construct a 102-story building, but taking into account the wind and other weather conditions, it is not an easy task: for the builders of the Empire State Building to create and hoist the dock the top they needed to first strengthen the skeleton of the building itself. “Architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether, would add stress to the frame. of the building." (paragraph @ NUM1) @ CAPS1 building the mooring mast the builders had to think about the violent wind speeds and the structure of the building to support themselves. There were many hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in order to complete their project.

THE OBSTACLE IS “ TO THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE MORNING MAST WAS NATURE ITSELF. THE WINDS AT THE TOP OF THE BUILDING ARE CONSTANTLY CHANGING DUE TO STRONG AIR CURRENTS ”.

Obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The obstacle was not successful using the mooring mast and nature itself. But after the celebration, they were disappointed because the airships could not dock there. After that, another airship, the Airship of the Year @ CAPS1 Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would fly away and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. When the stunt is unsuccessful, the airship could be used for transport in the future.

The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in trying to allow the airships to dock. There was no way for the architects to lay a mooring mast on the smooth roof of the building. If a thousand foot airship eclipsed the top of the building with just one tether cable, the building frame would be added instantly. The stress of the airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle for the builder was that the steel frame of the building would have to be reinforced to accommodate this new design. The biggest obstacle to launching this new design was nature. The architects had to take into account the constant change of winds due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would be unstable. The fact that this design would sway above pedestrians in the street, would worry people-conscious architects. Architects have also had to contend with the law banning airships traveling too low over urban areas. This law would set out the prohibited right to tie a large vessel to a vessel, or even to approach the area. Although there were attempts for airships to reach a building, the entire idea was scrapped, despite the architects.           

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that airships contain highly flammable gases. If the airship was docked over a large city like New York, it would be very dangerous for an airship to catch fire. Another obstacle was that the mooring system would not work as well as expected, nor would it be secure. These airships are at the mercy of winds and bad weather. In normal cases of mooring airships on open airstrips, they are ballasted at the front and rear. If the airships were to stay put on the Empire State Building, they would need to have weight in the back as well as in the front, which would eventually swing over the city. Without the weight on its back, the airship would rotate around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which the airships should be would not be certain. If the airship were blown by the wind, the airship would crash into the sharp tops of neighboring buildings. These are the obstacles that the builders faced when they tried to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building.          

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. The first obstacle encountered by the builders was that the building itself had to be modified. The architects responsible for adding the mooring mast realized that if they added the mast as is and started mooring airships to it, the structure of the empire state buildings would be strained too much. For this reason, they first had to make modifications of a value of @ MONEY1 to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen its framework (paragraph @ NUM1). The second hurdle that builders faced when trying to make more airships possible to a mast on the Empire State Building was just general safety. After the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like this would have been if it happened in a place as populated as @ CAPS1 (paragraph @ NUM2 ). It was not just the possibility of catastrophic disaster that added to the security concerns. Considering the constant strong gusts of wind that occur at the height of the mast, the architects realized that any airship moored there would constantly and rapidly oscillate around the mast. The way this problem is solved when docking airships to the ground is to hang weights on its back, but this would present another safety issue as the weight had to fall on people below, it could easily kill someone. one (paragraph @ NUM3). The last hurdle the architects faced was a law banning an airship flying so low near urban areas in the first place. In the end, the fact that there were so many obstacles kept the idea of docking airships there from becoming a reality.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock on the mast. One of the obstacles they faced was nature itself. It is said in the excerpt that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong air currents. Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot." It could have led to major accidents if the airships had been allowed to dock here. Another obstacle they faced was that these airships couldn't fly too low over urban cities. It says in the excerpt that "this was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the vessel or even to dock in approach the area. " But before the idea was even given up, two airships attempted to reach the building. The first could not reach the building because of the strong winds. The second airship attempted a stunt to drop a bundle of newspapers. They didn't have the right equipment, so they had to ask a worker to grab the bundle of papers that was tied with a rope. These obstacles were very important for the construction of the mast as it probably saved the lives of not only the aviators but also the people who lived in the urban towns below.

In @ DATE1, airships were known as the transport of the future. After the construction of the Empire State Building, the builder attempted to allow airships to dock there. There were three main reasons that prevented builders from attempting to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. "The only obstacle to expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone." Al Smith believed that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would allow airships to anchor there for hours. But it was not easy for architects to lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the Moorin mast was nature itself." The strong drafts due to the wind would rotate the stern of the ship around the mast of the moorin. "The other practical reason why airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas." Eventually two airships attempted it, but it didn't work.

Builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. The first issue they encountered was security. Many airships, especially those outside of the United States, used hydrogen which is highly @ CAPS1. So it wasn't safe in a place with a large population like downtown New York to have an airship that flies that low. This is not sure because in the event of an accident there could be a large number of fatalities. The second obstacle that the builders faced was that the winds were constantly blowing at the top and could not allow the airship to stabilize in one place. Instead, it would just go around the mast. The third and final hurdle that builders faced was the law. There was a law that prohibited air naval personnel from flying too low over urban areas. It was therefore illegal for a ship to be tied to the Empire State Building.

On December 11, 1929, Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would reach the height of 1,250 feet; taller than the tallest previous building, the Chrysler Building. Smith enlarged the building by adding a top or hat. John @ CAPS1 described it as "[The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than an ornament ... The Empire State Building would be outfitted for an era of transportation that was then only a few pioneers' dream. of aviation "(page 1). This dream was to have a mooring mass at the top of the building to moor airships, or airships. However, there were a lot of hurdles that arose as they started to plan for this, such as the amount of stress it would add to the framing of buildings, the use of hydrogen as opposed to helium and just nature. herself. "A thousand foot forklift held by a single tether cable would add stress to the building framing ... The Empire State Building should ... [have] more than @ MONEY1 worth of modifications (pg @ NUM1) . "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen ... and hydrogen is highly flammable (pg @ NUM1)" ... it was neither safe nor practical "

The hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there, as the airships had a top speed of eighty miles per hour. The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. The airships were moored with an electric winch, which ascended in line from the bow of the ship, then tied it to a sledgehammer. So the bodies of airships could sway in the breeze, yet passengers could get on and off safely.   

<START>

 

Builders faced many obstacles when building an airship mast on the Empire State Building. One of them was that they had to reinforce the foundation so that all the stress on the building structure did not tear it up. Also, the fact that it was impractical for an airship mast as the changing currents and winds would make it impossible to land or circle the airship and hit buildings. The workers faced these obstacles and finally realized that they could not do it.

@ ORGANIZATION2's mooring mast describes the problems architects encountered when attempting to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. The idea was impractical, mainly for security reasons. Most airships used hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. If an accident were to happen, the airship would crash into thousands of pedestrians in New York City. Nature was another reason why this idea was impractical. In New York City, there were constantly changing winds that knocked the airship out of control, even when docked. Some airships used lead weights to keep the backs from rotating, but in New York, "they would be hung over pedestrians on the street ... neither practical nor safe." @ CAPS1, air laws have prevented airship docks from becoming a reality. It was even illegal for airships to approach the area due to the height at which they had to fly. The moorings were impractical and "never served their purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever built."         

<START>

 

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" from Marcia Starch @ CAPS1, there were some obstacles when trying to build a dock for the Empire State Building. The first obstacle was how little room they had for a landing spot. New York has a lot of people and a lot of buildings. "The only obstacle to expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone." They were very big and therefore needed enough space to not touch anything else. Second, security. They had to think of everyone and the proximity of the building. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." If the wind was blowing too hard, it could pull it back into the building. Finally, the danger of the weights getting on a whole bunch of people's heads is pretty serious. "... using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be hung over pedestrians on the street ..." If ever one were to fail, it would probably kill someone. No one would ever get over what happened.

Some obstacles that Empire State builders faced when attempting to allow airships to dock there was that a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single cable of fastener, added stress to the building structure. The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and reinforced to adapt it to the new situation, the cost of which would exceed sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle to authorizing airships was the mast; one obstacle of the mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly changing due to strong air currents. When the airships landed, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mace, making it dangerous.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of them was unable to simply drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. An airship attached to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would emphasize the building's frame. Its weight and the pressure of the air would weaken the foundations of the Empire State Building. They had to make changes worth sixty thousand dollars to the frame to make it strong enough to support the weight of the airships. Another problem, the mooring mast not fulfilling its function, which should have been thought through before its construction; security. Many countries outside of the United States have used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an incident where an airship was destroyed in a fire because of the hydrogen in their balloon. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly changing from the strong air currents. If the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern would rotate on the mooring mast. The airships used weights to land in open fields, but could not fly over the building, as the weights suspended above pedestrians were not secure. The builders struggled to try to allow airships to dock there.

During the attempt to build an airship docking station on top of the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that made this idea less and less possible. A huge problem was due to the foundations of the building. A pivoting airship, which can be up to a thousand feet long, above the building would add a tremendous amount of stress. This meant that additional money would have to be invested in strengthening the foundation and frame, in order to support a huge zeppelin on the mooring mast. Since the building rises to 1250 feet above sea level, strong air currents flow through the top of the building. This caused impossible mooring conditions as the airship could strike the building and burst. Due to the flammability of hydrogen, this dangerous eruption could wreak havoc in the densely populated city below. Referring to the Hindenburg explosion at Lakehurst, @ CAPS1 1937, "The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely packed area. populated. " For mainly safety reasons, the airship docking station was never built.        

<START>

 

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. A big problem they faced was the wind. The way the docking station was constructed meant that the wind could catch the tail of the airship, causing it to spin around the building. In addition, when the docking station was completed, the wind made it dangerous for the airships to approach near the vessel. Another problem they faced was the stability and support of the building. "Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the structure of the building." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) It was so that an airship would not remove the docking station from the building. A final issue they faced was the safety of people. Most @ CAPS2 airships are said to use flammable gases to fly. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg on the busy streets of New York, it would be terrible. The Empire State Building construction crew encountered many problems, wind, stability, and security are just a few.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the very big hurdles they had to face was the thousand foot airship which added stress to the framing of the buildings. Therefore, "... must be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation." (@ NUM1) @ CAPS1, manufacturers face the security hurdle. The airships used hydrogen, "... rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." (@ NUM2. Line @ NUM3) The biggest obstacle encountered by builders was nature. As the winds shifted to the top of the building, the stern of the airships swiveled around the mast. Previous solutions ; "airships moored in open airstrips could be weighed down aft with lead weights ..." (@ NUM4. line @ NUM3-5) were not safe with the mooring mast of The empire state building. Finally, an obstacle they faced was that there was a "law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas". (@ NUM6. Line @ NUM7), the airships could not even approach this area.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles during its construction, some of those hurdles being safety, the technology they had, and the planning they put in place to build the mast. mooring. The mooring mast safety issues were that airships from countries other than @ LOCATION1 use hydrogen instead of helium. The hydrogen being very flammable, the risk of fire in the airship was very great. Another safety issue that builders faced was that the winds at the top of the building would be far too strong to successfully land an airship. The issues that builders ran into with the technology were that they didn't have the technology to successfully land an airship @ DATE1ft on top of a tower using just one cable, as that would add stresses on the framework of buildings and the stress of wind pressure would be dangerous for the framework of buildings. The hurdles that the builders faced when planning the mooring mast were that they had not planned well enough and should have seen that the mast would be a failure from the start.

Based on the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered some obstacles in trying to ban airships from docking. The top three hurdles that manufacturers faced were concern over safety, nature itself, and existing airship laws. Safety is a major factor during construction. Manufacturers have had the option of using hydrogen instead of helium. Risk that hydrogen is highly flammable. Realizing later how bad it could have been if what had happened to the German airship "Hindenburg" on May 6, 1937. It could have happened to them over a "densely populated" area like New York City. Nature itself was also an obstacle, as the winds at the top were constantly changing. This could potentially " pivot " the rear of the airship, as well as around the mooring mast. The last obatoce was that of “existing laws against aircraft flying too low over urban areas”. They were concerned that the winds would blow the airships into the sharp arrows of other structures and puncture the hull of the airship. In two unsuccessful attempts, they decided to cancel the construction of the "Mooring mast" due to "unresolved problems with mooring the airships on a fixed mast at such a height that it was desirable to postpone to a date. subsequent final installation of the landing gear. "

The builders encountered many problems in their attempts to allow an airship to land at the Empire State Building. One of the main reasons was safety, "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." I would have been too risky to allow such an airship over New York. Another problem was the drafts, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts. Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the ship. mooring mast. " A final issue was a law" against airships flying too low over urban areas. " This law would forever prohibit any airship from docking at the mast, or even from approaching the city in an attempt to dock.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The obstacles were security, nature and the laws. Most foreign airships used hydrogen which is highly flammable instead of helium. If an airship caught fire over a densely populated city, the result would be bad. The winds this high were very strong. There was no way to keep an airship still, even though the front was hooked to the building, the rear was swaying. It wasn't sure. There was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. It was illegal to fly near or tie up to the building. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there.

The construction of the Empire State Building was a project that encountered many obstacles. Due to the additional plan of building a mooring mast at the top of the building, a series of challenges and possibilities had to be considered. First, adding a mooring mast at the top of the building would significantly weigh down the building, adding stress to its frame. For this reason, modifications of a value greater than @ MONEY1 should be made to strengthen the frame of the building and stabilize it as a whole. Laws and regulations on how airships could fly over urban areas also limited the use of the mast as the building was located in the middle of a city, a densely populated area with thousands of pedestrians below, it was clearly neither practical nor safe. . In addition, nature itself was the biggest obstacle to the mast's success because, since many foreign airships used hydrogen instead of helium, it posed a risk of fire. Finally, strong winds and violent air currents generally prevented the construction of the mast, as using the top of the building as a dock for airships can be a bit of a stretch.

There were many obstacles that workers had to overcome in order to pass the mast process. They had to figure out how they were going to land the big plane on the small frame building. Additionally, workers had to find a way to safely get passengers on and off the plane while the tail was spinning in the air. They needed to talk and consult with the United States Naval Air Station because they were leaders in finding airships. Another obstacle that workers had to overcome was the low-flying planes law in @ ORGANIZATION3. So these are some of the obstacles that the mast builders had to overcome to build the mast on the Empire State Building at @ LOCATION1

Being an architect and construction worker is one of the toughest jobs in the world, especially at an elevation of @ NUM1 feet. The construction of the Empire State Building was not an easy task. An even more difficult task was to build a mooring mast, a mooring area for airships, on top of the Empire State Building. Since the building had a flat roof, "the architects could not just put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building." The architects had to build a rocket-shaped extension protruding from the flat roof. The architects also realized that having a single cable at the top of the extension to hook onto the airship would add enormous strain to the building. They had to find a way to relieve the stress on the foundation of the building. Although the architects faced challenges, they overcame them and planned to put their ideas into practice.

In attempting to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. One obstacle is putting too much strain on the framework of buildings. The airship should somehow be connected to the frame, which was NUM1 feet below. Another problem encountered by manufacturers was safety. Workers wanted to use hydrogen to keep airships afloat, but realized that hydrogen is flammable. Other problems where nature and the law. The winds of nature would prevent airships from standing still. Law said the airships would fly too low for urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges that led to the failure of a plan.

Many years ago, people were looking for a new, more convenient mode of transportation. After being introduced to the airship (or airship), it was thought that this small plane could be the transport of the future. Plans were made for a mast to be built on top of the Empire State Building in New York City. The project was soon launched, but not without obstacles along the way. The dangers of nature, the construction of the Empire State Building, and the differences between the American airships and @ CAPS1 hampered the success of the mooring mast. It is a well-known fact that nature can be unpredictable and incredibly harsh. This makes any transport, especially air transport, difficult and dangerous. During the construction of the mooring mast, strong wind currents were observed. It would be nearly impossible to allow an airship to dock atop the Empire State Building on a very windy day, as only the front portion of the plane would be secured. This puts pedestrians at risk. Second, it was noted that the roof of the Empire State Building needed upgrades for airships to dock there. When secured with a cable tie, the weight of the airship would press against the building. This could potentially be dangerous and cost around @ MONEY1 to repair. Finally, airships from other countries could not fly to the United States. American airships are filled with helium, which makes them very light and easy to fly. The @ CAPS1 models used hydrogen, which happens to be incredibly flammable. After a German airship was irreparably damaged by fire, it was determined that these models could not be used. Ultimately, the dangers associated with using airships for travel outweighed the benefits. It was determined that too many accidents could be caused by airships, so the Empire State Building had to be used in another way.

The obstacles that the manufacturers had to overcome to allow the airships to moor there were by an electric winch. By attaching it to the mast, Wind pressure. Need to be in an open field and weighed down in the back with lead weights. Try to tie up the building but it was illogical so they couldn't do it. Due to the strong winds, they could not tie it to the building either. The dirilage mooring equipment was never blocked either. The directors and their passengers had quietly disappeared and did not become means of transport but were handed over to planes.

Some of the problems that the designers faced were the strong air currents that form in urban areas, this would be a problem as the airship would be shaken due to its light weight. Another problem is the fact that it would be too dangerous to land with an airship over a densely populated area like New York.

The obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock were very difficult. The builders had to modify and strengthen the building. The modifications were very expensive. "Over sixty thousand dollars". Another obstacle that the builders faced was the winds at the top of the building. The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot. In addition, they faced security. The manufacturers were afraid that a @ CAPS1 would occur because the hydrogen refill of airships is very flammable. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." @ CAPS2, Another reason was that the law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law made it clear that the wharf would never take place. Even though they were quite tall, it was still effective. They couldn't even tie it up and secure it so it wouldn't fall off because it was still illegal. This law prohibited a vessel from mooring to the vessel or even approaching the area.

In the short story of "The Mooring Mast". by Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes three obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. Two reasons were certain. The first "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." A flammable vessel over a "densely populated area such as downtown New York could result in a disclaimer. The second safety reason was that" the winds at the top of the building were constantly turning from the currents. violent air ". in the street, was neither practical nor safe." The last obstacle the Empire State Building faced was the law. "An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas . to buildings or even approach the area. ”The law and the security obstacles facing the builders of the Empire State Building did not allow any attempt to dock the airships.

According to the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow the airships to dock there. When Al Smith was first planning the structure and use of mace, he seems to be too ambitious. In paragraph @ NUM1, the reader gets an idea of Smith's competitiveness, a quality that can detract from the practicality. Smith's determination for the Empire State Building to be the tallest was a hindrance because that is what initiated the idea of the mooring mast. Although it was clearly stated in the “ Mast Design ” section that a large part of the planning went into the construction of the mast, the extra effort required for this was also an obstacle. The mast delayed the completion of the whole building and as @ PERSON1 says in paragraph @ NUM2, the mast caused unresolved issues and postponements. A major reason for the mast failure was the issue of safety as the airships were highly flammable. As it also says in paragraph @ NUM3, "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". These both show the impracticality of installing an airship dock, revealing the biggest hurdles that builders have faced. Because ambition was more important than practicality in the construction of the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles and failed.

The @ CAPS1 that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there was the lack of suitable land. Another obstacle they faced was that the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong drafts. They also had to make sure that no sharp objects would punk the airships. These are the @ CAPS1 that the builders of the Empire State Building faced.

From what seemed like a very possible way to make the Empire State Building famous to realize how difficult it was going to be for the builders of the Empire State Building to cope with multiple obstacles by allowing airships to fly. moor. These problems included the added stress to the framing of the buildings. Therefore, the foundations should be motivated and strengthened to adapt to this added stress. The builders not only had to worry about the structure, but also the winds. of the obsticlas the builders finally realized that this "dream" was impossible to overcome

The builders of the Empire State Building had many problems trying to allow airships to dock there. Their first problem was that they couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Mainly because it is only held by a single tie and because that would add stress to the structure of the building. Another @ CAPS1 is that the wind speed was so much higher at the top of the building that it pushed the airships away from the docking station. Additionally, most of the airships outside @ LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to stay in the air, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. To the creators of the building, the idea seemed simply unrealistic, an airship would be too difficult to keep in one place suspended NUM1 feet in the air above New York City.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow the airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was that American airships used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If the airship were destroyed by fire over a densely populated area like downtown New York, the crash could be very dangerous. One of the main obstacles to using the mooring mast was nature itself. The author says that “ the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast, she describes the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building when trying to allow airships to dock there. In paragraph four, it says: "The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone." That would mean there wasn't much room for airships when it wasn't in the year. In paragraph sixteen, it says: " The US Navy Los Angeles airship is approaching the mooring mast but could not get close enough to moor because of the high winds ." This means that the weather conditions could make travel airships very dangerous.      

<START>

 

In attempting to allow the airships to dock with the Empire State Building, some of the obstacles they encountered were difficult. A name they called the airships of @ DATE1 was "Transport of the Future". There was also a law banning airships flying low over open areas. The builders had to make a lot of changes to make it perfect and get it the way they want it. Safety was most important, most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Although hydrogen is highly flammable, they still used it. In addition, “ The highest open observation platform, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public ”. And to this day, it is not open to the public.         

<START>

 

The three insurmountable obstacles that builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building were all a matter of public safety. They should have realized that "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen" and therefore were susceptible to explosion. In an urban city like New York, a thousand-foot airship that covered four city blocks would cause immense loss. Second, the strong drafts cause the winds at the top of the Empire State Building to constantly change. The mooring mast would not work in this environment unless the rear of the airship was ballasted with lead weights. Lead weights “ hanging over pedestrians in the street [would] neither be practical nor safe ”. Third, the importance of the public safety of aircraft had already been taken into account in the form of a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area." Mooring in an urban setting turned out to be too dangerous to be risky.

Although the purpose of the mooring mast was to help dock passengers safely from the airship, there were many difficulties that could have endangered many. “When the German airship '@ CAPS1' was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been had it been held above a densely populated area like downtown New York. " (paragraph @ NUM1) This shows that if an accident like an airship ignited over New York, there would be many serious injuries. "In December 1930, the American airship Los Angeles approached the mooring mass which was unable to get close enough to moor because of the high winds." (paragraph @ NUM2) The most difficult obstacle was to moor the airship while the wind was blowing extremely over it. The idea of using the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building was then abandoned.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the hurdles faced by builders was finding a way to dock an airship atop the Empire State Building without adding stress to the building's frame. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame" (Lüsted). Another obstacle he faced was money. they needed to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. “More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the building” (Lüsted). The biggest obstacle that the builders had to face was nature, the winds would move the airship a lot. "The biggest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself" (Lüsted). As you can see, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow the airships to dock there.        

<START>

 

Although they made a valiant effort to bring a seemingly ingenious idea to fruition, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in creating a dock for airships proved insurmountable. One of the challenges faced by the builders was the tumultuous winds atop the Empire State Building. These strong winds made it practically impossible to maneuver an airship at this altitude, let alone moor it to a vessel. Another obstacle the architects faced was the fact that there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too close to the ground over urban areas. This meant that it would even be illegal for any airship to even approach the Empire State Building. Finally, the creators of the Empire State Building took on the security challenge : @ CAPS1 are filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and an airship explosion over a densely populated urban area would have horrific results.

The builders encountered many problems while attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. First of all, attaching an airship with a single cable would add tremendous weight to the frame of the building. For this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be reinforced, which would add an additional cost of @ MONEY1. After the mast was built, the Empire State Building also faced new challenges. Most airships used hydrogen which was highly flammable. After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area like New York. Another problem was that it was too risky to have a large airship suspended above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air. The law also hampered Al Smith's idea. The law stipulated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas. When the Los Angeles airship attempted a test, the builders found that the wind was blowing too hard for the airship and they were concerned that it would fly into nearby buildings. The idea of airships was quickly forgotten and gave way to airplanes.

In the clip 'The Mooring Mast' I Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to create a mooring place on such a large building. Obstacles a law against airships flying at low altitude and nature itself made it difficult to create such a place in paragraph @ NUM1, it says' The other practical reason why airships couldn't over the Empire State Building was an existing law against low-flying airships over urban areas. "There was already a strong argument over the construction of the mast but Al Smith ignored it. This law banned ships from s 'Moor to the building. In paragraph @ NUM2 the author explains why nature was a problem, she says "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts" Already the @ CAPS1 is showing signs of danger to come if he pursued the idea any further. However, using them in the Empire State Building where they would be suspended in the air was neither practical nor safe. All of these reasons contribute to why the docking was not allowed . 

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. The biggest being the strong winds so high. The rear of the zeppelin would pivot around the mooring mast. There was also the fear that it would blow into the sharp arrows of nearby buildings, causing it to shatter. They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, as it wouldn't be safe to hang them over the streets. There was, at the time, a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas, for similar reasons. It would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast.

In the non-fiction clip "The Mooring Mast" by @ PERSON1, the architects encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The first hurdle the architects faced was the lack of a suitable landing zone. There was nowhere to land the airships. "A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and allow passengers to get on and off." This quote says that they needed to build a mooring mass to overcome the obstacle. The second hurdle they faced was that the architects couldn't just drop a mooring mass on top of the building. "A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." This quote says that the stress of the load and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted and that the immobile frame of the building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to the new situation. The third obstacle which was the biggest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." This quote says that the nature of the mooring mass itself was dangerous as the stern of the vessel would pivot around the mooring mass. This made the mass dangerous. These three obstacles were what the architects faced in constructing the mooring mass, in which to compete with the tallest building in the world.            

<START>

 

There were several obstacles to the success of the construction. Perhaps the main obstacle, the obstacle that nothing could be done against, was the wind itself. In paragraph @ NUM1, he mentions how the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts. These giant balloon-like devices constantly pivoted around the mooring mast even though they were moored. The Hindenburg disaster of May 6, 1937 also proved how dangerous it would be to have airships filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas over a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. The project was also hampered by existing laws on theft in urban areas. "It was illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area" - says the author in paragraph @ NUM2. Incoming airships would simply fly too low against the law for it to work.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered various obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. The builders first had to find out about the moorings. They "consulted experts, making tours of equipment and mooring operations" to find out more about them firsthand. The builders also had to worry about the frame of the Empire State Building. The framework "should be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation". This meant that the builders had to go back and work on the frame again. Attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building has caused builders to face a number of obstacles.

In @ ORGANIZATION2's The Mooring Mast excerpt, the architects encountered many obstacles to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building. Engineers had to go through various expirations and consult with experts, and make tours of the equipment that would be used on the project. The architects must have realized that they couldn't @ CAPS1 drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, they had to be aware of the consequences and the danger, like wind pressure. Additionally, if a fireworks display were to occur, many people would be injured or killed due to the people of New York City. The architects faced many obstacles, but then taught them about the danger and the result of the construction of the mooring mast.

The architects working on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The first was the fact that derigibles were not becoming the next transportation craze. Without derigibles to use the mast, it would be pointless. Another obstacle was the laws in place that prevented tanks from flying over low-lying urban areas. In any case, no airship could legally have been moored to the mast. A final obstacle was nature. High winds at the top of the building could cause the airships to spin, making mooring unsafe and impractical.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders had to face many obstacles in order for the airships to dock with it. From Marcia Amidon Lüsted's reading The Mooring Mast excerpt said airships measured up to a thousand feet, or four blocks in New York City. That raised the first hurdle, which is that they have nowhere to land this thing. They couldn't put it over New York because of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The architects also had to find a way to redesign the building to support the weight of the airship. The biggest obstacle they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and although it was attached to the building the back of it would still swirl, they had no way to fix this, as airships were usually weighed down by cylinder blocks. in an open field and it would be too risky to do so in a populated area.

In the excerpt, @ ORGANIZATION1's "The Mooring Mast" wanted to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building for supplies and services and to let passengers on and off. However, the builders of the Empire State Building went through many hurdles to allow this to happen. “Empire State Building architects and engineers consulted with experts, making tours of equipment and docking operations at @ ORGANIZATION3 in Lakehurst, New Jersey” (¶ @ NUM1). They had to meet with experts and analyze if this was going to be a successful idea. "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was built ... the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself "(¶ 's @ NUM2 & @ NUM3). Another obstacle that the builders had to face was nature. the winds there were very strong, so the idea of mooring airships on the Empire State Building was unsuccessful.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles during construction. When designing the mast, the architects realized that they couldn't just drop the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, as this would add stress to the building structure. The building should therefore be modified and reinforced in order not to meet these conditions. Then the builders ran into a safety issue, the winds at the top of the building were strong and constantly changing. This would rotate the airship around the mast. They decided to add lead weights to make the airship heavier, but hanging them over pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Lastley, existing laws against airships flying low over urban areas have made it illegal to achieve their purpose. Overall, the planning for the Empire State Building encountered many challenges.

While constructing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building, architects faced many obstacles, such as spontaneous combustion, nature, and airship laws. The first problem encountered by manufacturers was spontaneous combustion. Due to the accidental fire on the Hindenburg, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that if an airship were to light up on their building, the results would be even worse, as debris would fall on the busy streets of New York. A second problem encountered by builders was nature itself. Due to the strong drafts, the winds above the building were constantly changing. This would mean that even if it was moored and tied up, the stern of the ship would still turn. Normally the lead weights would hold the airships in the fields, but over New York it would be dangerous to break them and fall on pedestrians below. Finally, laws regulating the theft of airships were put in place and put the brakes on construction. These laws set a height limit above urban areas, making it illegal to dock for the Empire State Building, or even just approach it. The Empire State Building mast builders faced many obstacles during construction, such as fire, nature, and the law.

The builders of the State Building @ CAPS1 encountered many problems while attempting to allow airships to dock there. Their first problem was that it would add a lot of stress to the building. This means that if they had an airship attached to the building in the wind, it would weigh on the building or pull it. “Nature was their biggest obstacle” and it was very dangerous to have something like that hanging above the crowded streets of New York. In an attempt to strengthen the building, the builders had to spend more than " sixty thousand dollars " for the improvement of the skeleton or the frame. There were also laws in place that did not allow large planes to fly low over a crowded city. This tells us that even if they built the mast, it would be illegal for airships to land on it. There were a lot of issues, and the landing of an airship on the Empire State Building never happened.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered countless problems while attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the main issues is security. Even though the airships were going to be hung from the top of the building, the wind could potentially whip the airship into crashing into the building. Also after the crash of the Hindenburg, the builders realized how much damage could be done if this were to happen in New York. Laws are another issue they face. The law prohibited any aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. These problems made that idea disappear.

From the idea of building the Empire State Building to attempting to allow airships to dock with it, builders have faced various obstacles while attempting to allow airships to dock with it. Al Smith thought it was a good idea to add a mooring mast so that airships could dock there for several hours. However, in order to allow airships to dock there, builders had to transmit all the stress of airship load and wind pressure to the building's foundation, as a thousand-foot airship moored at the top of the building could add additional stress. constraints to the building frame. One of the greatest constructors of obstacles encountered was wind or nature. The force of the wind was constantly changing due to the strong air currents. For safety reasons, most airships were not safe as they mainly used hydrogen and hydrogen is flammable. Another obstacle they faced was an existing law that did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. Irving Clavan said: “ The still unresolved problems of securing aerial vessels to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone the final installation of the landing gear to a later date. " Because of the obstacles faced by manufacturers, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles disappeared.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, Lüsted addresses many of the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. They had to make a lot of adjustments to the frame of the building, the safety of airships was dangerous, and nature itself was a huge obstacle for builders. State Building because of the stress it would add to the building frame. As Lüsted states, “ The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. " The architects then had to make an accommodation that would strengthen the building to allow mooring airships. These improvements have cost architects @ MONEY1! The second obstacle encountered by manufacturers was the safety of airships. Back then, most airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The architects saw how dangerous it could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German airship Hindenburg. If the same thing happened in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage. Another obstacle that builders faced when trying to dock the airships to the Empire State Building was nature. The winds atop the Empire State Building were constantly shifting, making the airship very unstable. The airship is usually ballasted with lead weights, but in New York it wouldn't be safe as they would be suspended over pedestrians. The many obstacles encountered by the architects caused the mooring of the airships to fail.

According to the excerpt "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and allowed airships to dock there. Some of these obstacles included the fact that there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it impossible to tie a vessel to the vessel as it would be illegal. In addition, in the third line of paragraph thirteen, it is stated that this would have been dangerous because many airships in other countries used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen, being very flammable, would put people not only inside airships, but also near and around them, in great danger. Another obstacle mentioned in the excerpt, perhaps the most important, was the violent drafts that caused the wind at the top of the building to be always changing, making it almost impossible and dangerous for them to land there. Overall, the snippet made it clear that the only reasonable way for airships to land would be in an open field.     

<START>

 

Allowing airships to dock at the Empire State Building was difficult. For example, the mast was really difficult to build. Engineers and architects had to think about how to do it. And ensured the safety of passengers. First of all, airships are heavy. Hydrogen could make it broken. No one knows what will happen when the airships fly in the sky. The body of the airship could sway in the wind. Maybe out of control. Which floor can we put the mast on is also very important. I think no one likes to work under huge heavy airships.         

<START>

 

Right now, I'm going to tell us about some of the hurdles the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. First, in paragraph @ NUM1, the architects were blind to potential mast problems because most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Second, in paragraph @ NUM2, the biggest obstacle to this successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. Third, in paragraph @ NUM3, the other practical reason airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. That is why the mooring mast (airship) was never completed for this serious obstacle to put this in the Empire State Building.     

<START>

 

Manufacturers had to face many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. During @ DATE1, airships were a big thing in transportation. The problem was, there weren't a lot of landing zones for the airships to land because they were so big. So Al Smith had the idea of making a landing dock at the top of the Empire State Building for airships. The government had to review Al Smith's plan to make sure it was safe and would work. Al Smith's plan was to hook the airships to the building with a single tether cable. This would not be allowed as airships hanging from the wire would cause a lot of stress to the vessel. It was also not possible to have airships to land on the Empire State Building as the hydrogen and airships would pose a safety hazard. Hydrogen in airships could catch fire and burn down the Empire State Building.        

<START>

 

The owners of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the airships to tie up to the mooring mast. One of the first obstacles they encountered was having to modify and strengthen the steel frame. This was essential so that the vessel could support the mooring mast where the airships were supposed to dock. Another big concern was safety, they feared an accident similar to the Hindenburg one and thought "how much worse the accident could have been (paragraph @ NUM1) if it had happened in a city like New York. The biggest obstacle they encountered, however, was nature The strong air currents constantly caused the wind to move, causing moored planes to "rotate around and around the mooring mast" (paragraph @ NUM2). preventing airships from flying too low also made this dream a great fear for It not only prohibited them from mooring there, but even from approaching the area. Although this dream may have seemed possible at first, builders should have been aware of the many obstacles making their dreams utterly impossible.  

<START>

 

The obstacle builders encountered during the construction of the Empire State Building to allow the attempted mooring of an airship were blind. The pulling force of the unforeseen wind made the wharf unsafe for passengers and the foundations of buildings. However, making such attempts was a prerequisite for airships to fly over urban areas, if they were unsuccessful. The arrows also made it impossible for them to fall so they would come close in the event of a puncher as well. Spend sixty thousand for modifying the mooring mast on @ ORGANIZATION2 for the secure airship dock. The idea was lost with the creation of the new modern aircraft.     

<START>

 

According to the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building to allow airships to dock there were. The use of hydrogen rather than helium because hydrogen is highly flammable. The obstacles were nature itself. There are always strong and dangerous winds at the top of the building. It therefore allows the airship to pivot, which is dangerous. Airships moored in open airstrips could be weighed down, but their use at the Empire State Building may hang over pedestrians, which is unsure. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If the airship blows, the building's sharp arrows can pierce the airship's hull. These are the reasons and the obstacles that make it difficult to attempt the airship dock.

The builders of the Empire State Building face many challenges in trying to create a dock for airships. Builders couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. They had to think about how the airship @ LOCATION2 fair, they had to reinforce the building foundation and a landing zone for the airship. The airships were able to moor it using an electric winch. The problem was, they were in downtown New York, and New York City was a densely populated area. An airship floating in the middle of a heavily populated area would be very dangerous. Also an airship is made of hydrogen and helium and hydrogen is very flammable. So if an accident happened and an airship was destroyed, the people below would have died. Another obstacle was the law, airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. The biggest obstacle of all was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. This idea seemed good at first, but too much could go wrong.

When building the Empire State Building, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for airships (airships) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before building the mast, they had to stabilize the building with a steel frame and other modifications, as noted in paragraph nine. Airships are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support them with the strong winds blowing. Safety was also an issue with the addition of the mooring mast. Airships outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen and the airship caught fire, it could threaten the safety of civilians. After the mast was built, high speed winds were an obstacle again, and they did not even allow airships to approach the building. Despite the uniqueness of the idea of letting airships dock on the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that stood in the way of the idea being successful.

During the process of building @ ORGANIZATION1 encountered many obstacles. His first hurdle was the title threat for the tallest building in the world to be swept away by the Chrysler Building. When the architect added a 185 foot spiral to the top of the building. Al Smith had to find an innovative way to add height to the building. It was then that the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the building was formulated and the real problems arose. During the construction of this mooring mast, the mooring of airships would add intense stress to the structure of the building. “The Empire State Building's steel frame should be modified and reinforced to accommodate this new situation. (Paragraph @ NUM1)” Architects would add @ NUM2 dollers modifications to the frame to make it stable. Once the building could accommodate airships, security concerns would be encountered. First of all, airships are filled with hydrogen which is extremely flammable. After the New Jersey disaster, they didn't want to take any chances. Then, with the wind above the building, the drafts would cause the airships to move violently. Adding weights, used in other situations, was out of the question as they would be suspended high above pedestrians. Finally, it is obvious that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. What that would clearly violate. With all these obstacles to overcome, the idea of mooring airships on this mast was quickly abandoned.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of problems trying to allow airships to dock there. First of all, the frame of the building had to be reinforced. The weight of "the load of the airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." This meant the framing of the building had to be altered which cost @ NUM1 dollars. Then, it turned out to be dangerous to moor airships at the sumptuous skyscraper. After the Hindenburg fire, "the owners of @ ORGANIZATION2 realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area". In keeping with this danger, there were many at the time that prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. Finally, the biggest obstacle that engineers tried to overcome was quite simply nature itself. The winds at the top of the building made the airships almost impossible to land. Both the Columbia and the Los Angeles attempted to tie up to the mast but were unable to fight the wind. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building could not in turn dock an airship.

The obstacles encountered by the builder of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were difficult. The manufacturer met with experts to better understand how airships work. He was also told that architects could not put a mooring mast at the top because of the buildings' flat roofs. Paragraph nine states that a thousand foot airship held by a single cable tie would add stress to the framing of buildings. thousands of dollars of changes in the building. After all this time and money, he was told the plan should fail. The biggest obstacle with airships was the wind, if it moved through the air it could be a problem. Although this plan did not work, it is still 1,250 feet and taller than the Chrysler building.

In "The Mooring Mast," a landmark article by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it is clear that there were at least three obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. . These issues were the building's pre-existing frame, fire safety, and nature itself. The plans for the Empire State Building did not include a mooring mast being dropped on the building's roof. As a result, the architects had to modify their entire plan : " The steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation " (par. @ NUM1). It was a significant difficulty. Another concern for foreign airships was that the gas used provided fire safety and produced: " .... @ NUM2). It would be impossible to circumvent the risk of fire. Finally, as stated in the article, nature was the mast's biggest obstacle. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast" (par. @ NUM3). The strong winds prevented much from happening with the mast. With the three aforementioned obstacles, the fate of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was grim. He would never do what Al Smith had planned for him.

In the extract "The Mooring Mast", the builders encountered many obstacles. The main problem that was not noticed until the end ; was that it was a huge security issue. The builders wanted to make the mooring mast a mooring point for airships, airships and zeppelins from the country and other countries, but other countries used hydrogen rather than helium ; and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A fire in a metropolis like New York would be catastrophic! In addition, airships used large lead weights to weigh them down.

The invention of the Mace above the Empire State Building was an undeveloped idea that created a new form of transportation but has many flaws. One obstacle the engineers faced was getting a thousand-foot airship to rest above a twelve-hundred-and-fifty-foot building, because with the combined pressure of the wind, that would put pressure on the building's structure and allow it to collapse. This transport was also extremely dangerous for the public because many foreign airships “used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @ NUM1). Not only that, if the builders ever allowed airships to dock on the building, the rear of the airship would rotate around the mooring mast due to the displacement of strong air currents, as noted in paragraph @ NUM2. In paragraph @ NUM3, it says that an existing law would ban airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to dock airships atop the Empire State Building because the airships would be above people, which was against the law. All these obstacles made transports a failure and consequently the use of the mast was gone.

Another hurdle they faced was the cost, as it would take over sixty thousand dollars to make the appropriate modifications to the building's framing. In addition, safety was another major obstacle, they had to make sure that people were safe, as most airships in other countries used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. . The area was densely populated, an accident over the city would be much worse. The biggest obstacle was nature itself, but the winds on the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts, even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern would pivot. Airships moored in open airstrips could be weighed down, but their use would be dangerous to swing so high above pedestrians. Many obstacles were practical reasons they couldn't dock with the Empire State Building. There was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas and prohibiting ships from mooring to the building. For so long, these obstacles were encountered when trying to allow mooring.

Based on this snippet, the builders encountered some issues while constructing the Empire State Building. One of the problems was actually docking the Zeppelins or the airships. The wind was vicious at @ NUM1 ft in the air. Another issue that manufacturers face with safety. Since most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, this was a fire safety concern.

The Empire State Building's mooring mast was intentionally built for mooring airships. While the issue of allowing this to happen was not questioned when the mast was built, safety concerns were a major concern. Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen gas, which is extremely flammable. The news of the burning down of the German airship Hindenburg greatly worried the owners of the Empire State Building. They imagined how much worse it would be if an airship burned on the building and in a dense population of downtown New York. This led the builders of the Empire State Building to reconsider allowing airships to dock at its mooring mast.

Throughout history, workers in the Empire State Building have faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. The first obstacles they encountered were trying to tie up a thousand foot mooring to the top of the building. This was held together by a single tether cable and would add stress to the framing of the buildings. All the load of the airship and the pressure of the wind had to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, but it was eleven hundred feet lower. Another obstacle is that the hydrogen in the airship was highly flammable. If an airship were destroyed it would kill a lot of people because the Empire State Building is in downtown New York. The biggest obstacle was that the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing, so it would be very difficult to land.

In @ ORGANIZATION2's "The Mooring Mast", he explains how the budding idea of landing an airship on the Empire State Building was ultimately rejected due to numerous obstacles. The first design flaw the engineers @ CAPS2 was the stress the airship would add to the building's frame. A mass of this size attached to the building by a single cable tie would be @ CAPS1 in the building foundation. The biggest obstacle that engineers @ CAPS2 allowed to dock the airships was safety. With the use of hydrogen, airships are highly flammable. This would have created a dangerous situation in a "densely populated area like downtown New York". The last obstacle of the builders @ CAPS2 was the wind. The winds at this height were extremely strong. The @ NUM1 chapter states : "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast." This would create a dangerous situation for the passengers of the ship.

The Mooring Mast, written by @ PERSON1, presents two main hurdles that Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock. The first problem was the uncontrollable factor of mother nature. With high speed air currents, "the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast". If the airship failed to dock properly, the dangers would be that it "hung over pedestrians in the street, (which) was neither practical nor safe". Another problem the builders faced was the already existing law that ensured that airships did not fly too low over cities. The author notes: "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the building or even to approach the area." Due to nature and the pre-existing legislature, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome enigmatic problems.

The second hurdle was that in order to have a thousand foot airship docked at the top of the building, they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars just to accommodate the new station. Another obstacle being airships could not dock or dock at the Empire State Building due to the law in force prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. There are three obstacles that have made it difficult to support airships in the future. That's why we now have planes.

There were many obstacles faced by builders attempting to allow airships to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that attaching a huge airship to the top of the building would add excessive tension to it. Lusted explains, "A thousand foot airship moored at the top of the building ... would add stress to the framing of the building." @ CAPS1, a major revision of the framework of the structure was necessary. Another obstacle was nature. Wind currents would push the airship and that would be very dangerous. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast." This would make it unsafe for passengers to get on or off the airship. There was also a law in place that prevented "airships from flying too low over urban areas." These obstacles have prevented builders from safely designing a way to moor airships.         

<START>

 

Allowing the stockpile of airships to the Empire State Building was never possible due to obstacles encountered by architects. First, nature was against the builders. The strong winds at the top of the building were constantly moving, posing a hazard to the airships. It was out of the question to moor airships that would carry weights because they represented a danger to pedestrians. Another obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal to dock an airship at the Empire State Building. The last obstacle was that an airship could accidentally ignite and fall on New York. The destruction of the Hindenburg made it clear that it was not possible to have an airship dock at the Empire State Building.

The architects of the Empire State Building encountered many problems while trying to install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were many safety issues around getting around an airship or airship landing on the building. Residents of a populated area like New York City are not the safest place to land an airship, “ When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the owners of the airship Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident was. could have been if it had occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York. " They could not take that risk. Thus, competition for the landing gear has been canceled. A Another main cause was the wind current at the top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to maintain an airship at high altitude, " The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong air currents. . Even though the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship pivoted and around the mooring mast. " This could potentially cause the airship to detach and collide with other buildings. This is why landing airships on the Empire State Building would be dangerous and difficult.

In this excerpt "Le Mât d'Amarrage", by @ ORGANIZATION1, workers and builders try to make a mooring area for Airships. In doing so, they @ CAPS1 many obstacles. First of all, the obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing zone. They really should have thought about making it bigger in the first place. The workers worked but were not sufficient. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. If they were good builders and knew what they were doing, then they would know the liquidation is higher. Bacicaly should have thought a little more; Finally, the law prohibited airships from flying at low altitude over urban areas. I should have checked if there were any laws there were; Besides, it all works for nothing. All of these obstacles that workers and builders @ CAPS2 could have been avoided, so that money and time were not wasted.

In the excerpt " The Mooring Mast " from @ ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building while trying to allow airships to dock here. An example of this is "The barrier to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone." This shows that the mooring mast is going to be a problem as it lacks a proper landing zone meaning it is too difficult for landing, not for mooring. Another example is " A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building held by a single tether wire would add stress to the building frame." " This shows that the building is not stable enough to land one last example. “ The biggest obstacle to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself. " This shows that the weather can change, and it will affect its landing. These examples show how in the excerpt 'The docking mast' from @ ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders were confronted with.

The use of the mast on the Empire State Building for airships encountered many obstacles. High winds, the amount of structural support, and anti-low-flying aircraft laws made it impossible to use. High winds would turn the rear of the plane and therefore the entire airship around the boom, and its structural support was extremely risky. However, the main point of interference was an "existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area." These things inevitably lead to the non-use of the mast.

The obstacle the builders encountered in attempting to allow airships or "airships" to dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself. The reason nature is the obstacle to mooring airships to the building is because wind currents move the end of the airship. If the airship is moving in the wind while the passengers are leaving or entering, it would be very easy to fall. Another obstacle encountered by builders when docking airships is the lead weights that hung from the ends of the airships. These weights were used to prevent the airship from changing direction due to wind currents, but it was a concern for the safety of pedestrians on the street. On @ CAPS1 @ NUM1 of "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, he quotes that "... that using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be hung above pedestrians in the street, was neither practical or safe ". This quote proves that putting weights in the back of the airship would be dangerous. If they fall, someone could be seriously injured on the street.

Building docks for airships to land on the Empire State Building was a real challenge for Al Smith. The Empire State Building's steel frame had to be reinforced because the load from the airship and the wind pressure would put too much pressure on the building's frame. The airships were highly flammable and this posed a huge risk to the safety of building workers and people on the street. The airship's movements could not be monitored due to strong drafts at the top of the building. The main reason the airship docks did not work was because of the airship law. The law did not allow airships to fly low over urban areas. The invention of airship docks on the Empire State Building was unrealistic and dangerous.

In "The @ CAPS1 Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. What made the realization of this project very difficult. Workers faced safety issues from chemicals and some gases.

Some obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building while creating the Empire State Building have to face all the fast winds. This reason is that the giant needle that was built on top of the building wiggled back and forth. which made it more difficult to keep it in place. Another obstacle would be @ CAPS1 bringing the airship or airships to the giant needle. It would make the airship jump. There was only a cotton fabric.

According to the excerpt, there were numerous obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles faced by manufacturers was that airships were too big and could be dangerous. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." This shows that it will be more difficult to build the mast than expected. Another obstacle encountered by builders was that the building had to be modified. "The Empire State Building's steel frame should be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation." The biggest hurdle the builders faced was that he wasn't sure. "Most of the airships outside @ LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" @ CAPS1 some of the hurdles faced by builders

In @ ORGANIZATION2's short story "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. For example, they needed a suitable landing zone, which they couldn't do very easily. They needed to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, but the architects couldn't do it without a problem. It took a lot of work. The @ CAPS1 says "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." @ CAPS2 they had an idea to add to make it work, would add stress to the building and take it down. Wind pressure is also a big factor. The winds made it difficult for the airships to remain stable. They wanted to add weights to keep it going, but that wouldn't be good for the people below. The @ CAPS1 says, “Can be ballasted in the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. faced many problems.

This dream of the aviation pioneers was to travel by airship was an elusive dream. Architects and engineers who attempted to establish a mooring mast had high hopes, including a meeting with the president. "Held by a single tether cable" would not be stable enough to mount the airship because the building frame would be too stressed. And if they did that, the Empire State Building would have to be altered and strengthened to accommodate the new placement of the airship. But instead, the architects awarded a "shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower," and then designed the mooring mast. However, before the mooring mast could be finished the roof had to be finished before the mooring mast could adjust to its fullest position, the main problem with the mooring mast was nature. Nature could easily spoil the mooring mast, due to the winds, causing the airship to move. In addition, due to a "law against airships flying too low", the airship would also violate this law. The whole attempt to make a mooring mast slowly deteriorated due to all the obstacles.

The builders of the Empire State Building struggled to attempt to allow airships to dock there. First, they had to consult experts to see if the equipment was safe enough. They made tours of the equipment and mooring operations at @ ORGANIZATION2 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Then they struggled to drop the mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building. They would have to us @ MONEY1 value of modifications to reinforce the framework of the building. They were never going to see this happen in the first place, due to the safety issue, the hydrogen gas in the airship is highly flammable. The biggest problem, however, was nature. The winds at the top of the building made the work very difficult and it became very violent.

The builders encountered many obstacles to realize their idea of mooring airships. One of the main issues was that most of the airships around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable, which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude. The biggest obstacle to his success was nature itself. The winds where the mooring would occur were constantly changing and this would make the stability of the airship very difficult with the aft end extending so far from the tower. Another reason it wouldn't work was because of an already existing law prohibiting air ships from flying so low over urban areas.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all due to the addition of the mooring mast. First, the architects had to modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building. The architects knew that the large mooring mass could not simply be placed on the flat roof of the building. Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains that "a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building". (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). Because the building had to adapt to the situation, they spent more than @ MONEY1 to modify the frame. Another obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were the safety concerns of the new mooring mast. These safety concerns arose from an incident when the Hindenburg, a German airship was destroyed by fir in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Because the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, the risks were higher. Helium is more flammable. Lüsted writes that "Empire State owners realized how much worse the crash could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area like downtown New York." (Lüsted @ NUM2). The Empire State Building was just an inconvenient location for an airship dock. Finally, by the end of the 1930s, it was certain that the mooring mass would not fulfill its role as airships had now given way to airplanes.

The builders who built the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. More importantly, they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the building and hope for the best. The mast would add a large amount of stress to the frame, also take into account the stress of airship load and wind pressure, and the frame would need to be modified and reinforced. Safety was also a key issue faced by manufacturers. Most airships were highly flammable, and flying them over a city as populated as New York would be impractical. In addition to their flammable characteristic, there was also a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. It was therefore illegal to tie up or even approach the building. The last obstacle encountered by the builders was the wind. The winds at this height were constantly changing due to the strong currents. There was also the fear that the wind would push ships into the sharp arrows of another building. Taking into account the obstacles and the loss of interest in airships resulted in the project being stopped.

New technologies, especially aeronautics, require implementation work, which entails many obstacles to overcome. In order to make this mooring mast on the Empire State Building successful, builders had to know how to keep the airship hooked to the building and able to get on and off passengers. A supporting quote from the text would be "A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and allow passengers to get on and off." (6). But passengers weren't the only hurdle manufacturers had to overcome. The stress that an airship would place on the building would be too great, meaning they also had to remodel the building itself. The text backs this up with, "the steel frame of the Empire State Building should be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation." (@ NUM1). Even with all of these modifications, however, the mooring mast was doomed for reasons the builders could not fix.

Based on the clip, The Mooring Mast, obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building were presented as airships had to dock there. The first hurdle was safety as most of the airships outside @ LOCATION3 were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable compared to helium. The builders were concerned because on May 6, 1937 the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, since it was filled with hydrogen, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The second obstacle was nature: “The winds ... were constantly moving because of the strong air currents. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast ”(paragraph @ NUM1). This meant passengers couldn't get off safely, and the airship could hit anything nearby if it got turned bad. The final hurdle was an existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, meaning it was illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or approach the area. As a result, the builders of the Empire State Building who attempted to allow airships to dock there were presented with many obstacles as shown in the excerpt, The Mooring Mast.      

<START>

 

Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing airships to dock there were, the building's framing and height of the building, and where passengers would land and dock. The framing of the building was important because if a thousand foot airship were to dock at the top of the building, it could add stress to the structure and framing of the building and transfer everything to the foundation of the building. The wind pressure and the change of direction would also push the airship up adding more stress *** to the building. space and more height The building needed an observation room and a boarding room. When the building was redesigned, the building reached 102 floors and on the 101st floor it was an observation room doubled as a boarding area. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many design obstacles in the attempt to allow airships to dock on the roof, including adding height to the building. The main problem, however, was the frame of the building. It needed to be reinforced and in doing so it would allow an airship to dock at the top without any problems for the structure of the building.

Competing architect Al Smith wanted the Empire State Building to be the tallest and most unique building. “ Their summit, they said, would serve a higher calling ” (@ NUM1). The building supported the era of airship transportation. Al Smith commented "It's level, okay. No kidding. We're working on it now" (@ NUM2). In reality, the architects were blind to the potential problems with the mast. There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the main reasons was security. If airships from outside the United States were used to the mast, they could be highly flammable due to the use of hydrogen rather than helium. Another reason was nature itself. The changing winds due to the strong air currents made her dangerous as the stern of the ship twisted around the mooring mast. Most importantly, an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would then make it illegal for a vessel to be tied to a vessel. In the late 1930s, airships, instead of becoming the means of transportation of the future, gave way to airplanes.

According to the excerpt, builders had to cope with many difficult tasks. The builders had to make sure that the mooring mast was stable enough to dock there. They also had to add more floors to the Empire State Building, as the original Chrysler building added an additional 46 feet to still be the tallest building. Now the architects were to have the 85th floor plus the mooring mast, which brought the Empire State Building to a total of 1,250 feet. The reason a mooring mast failed was because the airship was highly flammable and in a densely populated area like New York City it would be tragic. Also nature itself with the wind was a violent draft. This would cause the stern of the airship to move around the mooring mast.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow the airships to dock there. One obstacle being the safety of people below in the streets. In the excerpt from paragraph @ NUM1, it is clearly stated that it was dangerous because of the airship which caught fire, it would be "Much worse if it had taken place over a densely populated area". Another obstacle would be that there is a law which is stated in paragraph @ NUM2 which says that there is "an existing law against aerial vessels flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to fly too low over urban areas. 'Moor to the building or even approach the area. The biggest obstacle however was nature itself, as shown in paragraph @ NUM3. around the mooring mast. An idea came up in the plan that said "Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted in the back with lead weights "@ CAPS1 why not at the Empire State Building? Safety is the reason because the weight on the Building would be suspended above people in the street, which would be dangerous, and then travelers approaching the building would fear that the wind would blow the airship at the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area, which would be dangerous.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there are that airships use different gases to stay aloft. As noted in paragraph 6, the first hurdle the builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building is " For their extended use in New York City was the lack of an area of airship . proper landing. ” From paragraph @ NUM1, it is stated that if a mooring mast were to be lowered to the roof of the building and only one tether cable would add stresses to the building and the pressure would force them to modify the building and the frame, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words, most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also from paragraph @ NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause the air current to move constantly. “The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was built.

According to the excerpt " The Mooring Mast " by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face many difficulties in trying to allow airships to dock there. In every building or project, there must be the certainty that it is safe for everyone and that there is no risk of harm. "The main reason was safety. Most airships coming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." Airships, or airships, were not generally safe at the time. If a fire were to burn in the middle of the country, the death toll and the cost of repairing what was damaged would not be as high as if it were to burn in downtown New York. One of the challenges, if not the biggest, for Empire State builders was that landing flammable airships in the middle of a city was a safety hazard that could potentially kill many people as well as destroy parts. from the city.

When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to moor the airships, the builders encountered a few obstacles. An airship is an airship filled with hydrogen and / or helium to keep it slightly in the air. What manufacturers haven't realized in advance is that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked at the top of a building around a movement, it could easily catch fire and detonate the entire building itself. Another obstacle that the builders noticed was the high winds. With an airship pier so high in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off. Strong winds would cause the stern of the airship to pivot around the mooring mast as only the bow would be heavier. The last obstacle encountered when docking an airship was that it would be too low for an urban area. The airship would be too close to pedestrians, creating a dangerous environment if anything went wrong. Without taking this risk, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of mooring an airship atop the Empire State Building was scrapped.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast," the builders faced obstacles of safety, nature, and the law while attempting to dock airships to the top of the Empire State Building. First, it wouldn't be safe. In the excerpt, he said, "Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." In a densely populated area like New York City, they couldn't risk seeing an airship catch on fire and cause massive chaos. Second, nature would not agree. In the excerpt, it is written: “The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. Because of the winds in New York, the airship would not be properly secured and many airships would be destroyed instead of being held in place. Finally, there was the reason for the law. The excerpt explained that "The other practical reason airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas." This was the most important reason of all. They could have taken risks on the other theories, but on this one they had no choice. They wouldn't be able to fight the law to allow airships to fly that low. In conclusion, the obstacles encountered by the builders of security, nature and the law could not be overcome to put the mast in place and operate.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with docking airships, one of the most obvious reasons was the danger of docking at such high altitudes. If an accident were to unfold like a fire, the whole area would be in danger. The changes to the building itself were significant enough, without requiring additional work.

Allowing airships to dock with the Empire State Building came with a lot of hurdles to make it work. One obstacle is their extensive use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Some airships were up to a thousand feet long, which equates to four city blocks in New York City. Another obstacle is that they couldn't drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. This would add stress to the framing of buildings and moored airships.

The Empire @ CAPS1 construction workers encountered many obstacles to allow the airships to moor there. Workers encountered major problems with the safety of the mooring over a large city. In addition, the reality of the construction and the location was a future problem for the workers. The process was an unsettling challenge overall. He wasn't sure if he had a big plane with passengers hanging over a big city. Of great concern was that other airships used hydrogen, "and hydrogen is highly flammable." The possibility of having a fire over a city was a risk they couldn't face. Airships weren't even allowed by law to come close enough to the Empire State Building to dock. The workers had to face the realities of construction and location. The mast was so high that the airships could not dock due to the "strong air currents". Some airships did not even have the correct "mooring equipment installed". The whole project was unrealistic, so it was a big challenge for workers mooring airships.

The builders had a tough hurdle as they in @ CAPS1 tried to @ CAPS2 A global building @ CAPS3. And tried to compete. Airships were part of @ CAPS3 in the construction of the Empire State Building as they faced tough obstacles like @ CAPS5, @ CAPS6, Height and ext. These are the @ CAPS7. On airships at @ CAPS8 There was Airships weren't heavy @ CAPS9 They @ CAPS10't @ CAPS8 too And it was made with lightweight materials. These are the reasons why this is happening.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were nature and safety. Security played a big part in the construction of the Empire State Building. Two main safety concerns were getting passengers safely on and off airships and the substances that filled them. " Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable " (paragraph @ NUM1). The next hurdle that builders faced was nature. The wind speed would change due to the strong air currents, causing the airships to pivot. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast" (paragraph @ NUM2). Due to nature and safety concerns, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles allowing airships to dock with it.         

<START>

 

When attempting to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles. One obstacle they encountered was the strong wind current. As stated in paragraph @ NUM1, "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts". This would rotate the stern of the ship around the mast. Another obstacle was the added stress that would be placed on the foundation of the building. "The steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to accommodate ..." as indicated in paragraph @ NUM2. A third hurdle that builders faced in this case was the danger of fire, as well as the risk of endangering those below, which is discussed in paragraph @ NUM3. A final obstacle encountered by manufacturers was "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas" (paragraph @ NUM4). These are just a few of the many major hurdles faced by builders trying to dock airships atop the tallest building in the world at the time.

The builders of the Empire State Building are trying to allow airships to dock there. However, this task was not so easy. The builders of the Empire State Building couldn't just drop a mooring mast onto its flat roof, because they had to consider how the size of airships was affected. “ Architects couldn't compare a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building ”(paragraph @ NUM1). In addition, it would be difficult to transmit the stress of the airship load and wind pressure. The Empire State Building's steel framing would need to be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation. "(Paragraph @ NUM1). The cost of upgrading the building's framing was also a hindrance. " Over sixty thousand dollars modifications had to be made to the structure of the building ”(paragraph @ NUM1).        

<START>

 

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were that they had to expand the Empire State Building. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow airships to anchor for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow passengers to get on or off the airship. The airships were moored, which meant the electric winch, in which was hoisted in line from the bow of the ship, and then attached to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within. The roof had to be completed before the mooring mast framing could take place. Everything went as planned, as the manufacturers wanted.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. As there was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. In addition, they could not anchor in the back of the airship, and due to the changing winds so high, it would not be safe for passengers to get on and off. The building also had to be rebuilt to be able to come close to remaining stable with the airship attached. And finally, the differences in the gases used to keep airships afloat. most airships outside @ LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen is very flammable, which makes it very dangerous. Here are some of the obstacles that the Empire State Building builders encountered in allowing airships to dock there.       

<START>

 

They were faced with challenges such as how to anchor the airships to the building. There really was no safe way to do it. They also said the gas that keeps it floating is highly flammable. So it was like a big security issue. In fact, they eventually realized that it was too dangerous for them. If they took a chance and something went wrong, innocent people could die.    

<START>

 

The airships had @ NUM1 obstacles to contend with, they had the potential for fire, burst, and law trouble. They were concerned that the airship could catch fire because it contains hydrogen, which is rather highly flammable. They don't want to relate to the accident that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. Also with the fear of pops they are more concerned. because the wind could carry it away from chores in another building with a sharp top that could possibly puncture the balloon. There were concerns that this could happen in downtown New York City, where it is heavily populated. Another major issue was that the Empire State Building wanted a law for low-flying planes over urban areas, so there was no way they could do what they planned to do. To do.     

<START>

 

The biggest hurdle the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow airships to dock. It was " the winds at the top of the building were moving with satisfaction because of the strong air currents ." Due to the wind currents, the airships could not stand still to allow passengers to get off the airship. They have already tried this. "In December 1930, the airship @ ORGANIZATION2 Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to block the base from strong winds." If the blue winds are strong, it could @ CAPS1 the airship in a sharp object. After this attempt there was one; "The building was an existing low against airships flying too low over urban areas." "It would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building." @ CAPS2 no airship could ever tie up the building because of this new law. The biggest obstacle was the wind. The winds were because it put tremondous stress on the building.             

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced more problems than expected. One of the first problems they encountered was that the building's frame could not support a huge airship. "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building ... over sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the building" (@ NUM1). The builders were forced to modify the frame, which was very expensive and turned out to be a major obstacle. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the wind caused by nature. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." (@ NUM1). These winds could potentially cause the stern of airships to rotate around the mooring mast, making it incredibly difficult or dangerous to get on or off airships. Finally, manufacturers have faced the problem of laws prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. “This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area” (@ NUM3). If the ships couldn't even legally approach the building, the builders found the obstacles were too great for the mooring mast to work. After realizing all the problems and dangers associated with this idea, they decided that the mooring mast would never succeed.           

<START>

 

Airships were hailed as the means of transportation of the future. They were much better than the balloons. In New York City, there was a lack of suitable landing zones for airships. It would be a good idea for the Empire State Building. Landing on the building would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or other services. Architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on top of the building. The airship is a thousand feet long. This would add stress to the structure of the building. Engineers quickly designed a tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. The mast had four wings at its corners. The building now has 102 floors. The @ NUM1 and 102 floors were intended for the observation area to serve as a boarding area for the passengers of the airship. The workers celebrate the framing of the entire building after two months. Now people have given up hope. This is because the Empire State Building's mooring mast never served its purpose. It has never been safe or practical. Builders face so many obstacles.                

<START>

 

Turning the mast of the Empire State Building into a dock for airships presented many obstacles. There were obstacles like flammable gas in airships, dangerous near a densely populated area, the wind was constantly changing due to drafts, and it swayed above pedestrians. These obstacles were very difficult to resolve. In airships, there is hydrogen, and hydrogen is very flammable if airships catch fire. It is also dangerous to be above a very densely populated area because if the airship breaks down it will come across innocent bystanders. It is also dangerous because the winds change a lot, and it can be shattered by other objects or buildings around the airship. So, why it is difficult to transform the mast into a loading dock for airships. Turning the mast of the Empire State Building into a loading dock for airships is very difficult to do because it is not safe.                     

<START>

 

In trying to allow airships to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. Security was a huge issue. Foreign carts often used hydrogen gas to stay in the air, which is highly flammable. A fire posed a dangerous threat in an area as densely populated as New York. Another big obstacle was the turbulent wind at the elevation of the mooring mast, which would have prevented the airship from staying in one spot. This would make it extremely difficult for passengers to board or exit the zeppelin safely. One way to solve this problem would be to weigh down the airship with lead weights, but it was also a dangerous practice, as the weights could fall to the ground and crush passers-by. Although a mooring mast was in theory a useful idea, it was neither safe nor practical.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's frame. As noted, modifications had to be made to the building frame to strengthen and adapt to the new situation. Another big obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. "The winds at the top of the building were causing the consulate to move due to strong drafts." This would let the airships rotate the air over the pedestrians, which was neither practical nor safe. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles during the project, which unfortunately led to the known fact that the Empire State Building was never going to fulfill its purpose.       

<START>

 

Some of the hurdles the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there was that architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. They would also have modified and reinforced the steel frame of the Empire State building and it was all going to be worth sixty thousand dollars of modifications. These engineers had to try to find a practical arrangement, and the Washington government was looking for a safe way to tie the airships to the mast. This idea of doing this was neither practical nor safe as all of these things would be hanging over pedestrians on the street. This could never have happened either as there was a law banning airships flying low over urban areas. These are some of the hurdles that builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock above the Empire State Building.     

<START>

 

Builders and architects faced several different obstacles and dilemmas that hampered the construction of the Empire State Building. One of them being the funds needed to produce such a large structure. They found themselves building and rebuilding the frame of the structure time and time again, all in a feeble attempt to achieve the desired perfection. Another hurdle came when their whole concept was shattered by the fact that not all airships intended to land on the mast were powered by helium. The text reads : "Most digesters outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). It shows the severity of the idea, where such risks just couldn't be taken, so they ditched the mooring mast idea.      

<START>

 

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast", he shows that it was not easy to make airships a safe docking station. One struggle that was encountered during this time was that airships from other countries were made with hydrogen which is highly flammable. This meant that if exposed to fire, it would instantly catch fire above the world's most populous city. Another issue facing the amount of wind at the top of the Empire building. With all this wind, it was difficult for the airship pilots to navigate. The wind blew them down, the pilots could not let go of the geers. These were just two of the many struggles pilots and architects faced when mooring an airship to a mast.   

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building @ CAPS1 threw up many obstacles. They consulted with experts making equipment tours and docking operations at the US Naval Air Base. The builders also had to meet with the president of an incorporated airship transport company.  

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when they had airships to dock there. One obstacle, for example, was the landing. New York lacked a suitable landing zone for an airship. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. Also, security was an issue. A German airship was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the crash could have been, especially in New York City. Even nature was an obstacle. The winds were constantly swirling at the top of the building. Lead weights were therefore used for the airship which was unsure as they were hanging over pedestrians. There was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas.          

<START>

 

According to the article "The Mooring Mast" written by @ ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building has encountered many obstacles. There are three main reasons for the @ CAPS1. The SB was not used for the purpose for which it was built. The goal of @ CAPS1.SB was for airships to be able to stop and refuel. Airships is an old word for airships. The obstacle that the @ CAPS1.SB had to overcome were the modifications, the nature and the law. They had to pay @ MONEY1 in modifications on the @ CAPS1.SB for the framework. The second was nature, the winds moved the backs of airships, they wanted to put weights in the back but it wasn't safe. Last but not least, by law, airships cannot be as low as the @ CAPS1.SB because it is too low and they cannot fly low over urban areas.        

<START>

 

Based on the article " The Mooring Mast " by @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there, including the overall structure of the building affected by airship stress, safety concerns, and the impact of nature. For starters, the weight of the airship and the wind pressure around the building put too much stress on the building's frame. The metal frame of the building would have to be reinforced and modified to allow the airship to be moored there. This modification and strengthening of the construction process would require an investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Then the safety issue arose after being overlooked before the start of the building process. Most airships used outside the United States contained hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, as opposed to the use of helium. This was a serious problem for a German airship named Hindenburg, when it was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. @ ORGANIZATION2 writes " the owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad the accident could have been worse if it had taken place over a densely populated area like downtown New York "(@ ORGANIZATION2 @ NUM1). It was a major obstacle with the wind factor. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting and no lead weight could be placed on the airship to prevent movement because it represented a serious threat to pedestrians below. Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building have faced many obstacles that the prevented it from becoming a great landing point for airships.

When designing an airship moored atop the Empire State Building, architects and engineers encountered many obstacles. Being such a huge project, these obstacles came naturally. The first obstacle was purely architectural. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building ... would add stress to the structure of the building." Architects would have to redesign the frame of the building to make the building last. The other two obstacles should have been clear from the start; the first being nature. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." Now the wharf would not only be difficult to reach, but extremely dangerous. The last hurdle could not have been overcome by architects or engineers if they had tried, not legally anyway. "... the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas" would also restrict the project, and in fact stop it altogether. Obviously, some major deciding factors had been overlooked in the design of the moor. @ ORGANIZATION2's competitive attitude made it that way, but "The mooring mast ... was never meant to serve its purpose."            

<START>

 

In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ ORGANIZATION1 the vessel encountered obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to moor there. One obstacle was that it would add stress to the frame of the building. To cope with stress, $ 60,000 of modifications and strengthening should be done. Another obstacle was that airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable. if something like the burnt-out German Hindenburg happened in New York, the consequences would be much worse. In addition, the wind would also be an obstacle. This would rotate the stern of the vessel all the way around the mooring mast. One of the most overlooked hurdles was the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas, and it was even illegal for the ship to tie up to the building. Clearly there are many obstacles to put in place in attempts to allow the airship to land on the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One hurdle was overcoming the added stress that a dock airship would add. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, author Marcia Amidon Lüsted states that "the stress of the load of airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundations of buildings ...". of the building. Lüsted said: "Even if the airships were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot and break the mooring mast." This was a problem because it would make it dangerous for passengers to get out of airships and descend a gangway connected to the Empire State Building. The wind also made it difficult for an airship to navigate to the mooring mast without being blown into other vessels in the area. One of the biggest obstacles was securing the mooring mast. Lünden states that "most airships outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." If an airship caught fire over a densely populated area like New York City, the casualties would be significant. These are some of the many obstacles that builders encountered when attempting to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of trouble and confusion in attempting to allow airships to dock there. This had never been done before @ CAPS1, they had no idea what to expect except for a mooring mast. At first Al Smith and his builders thought it was an amazing idea, a technology of the future, but things weren't that easy. They faced complications with @ ORGANIZATION1 with their airship research. It was a complicated process as it was @ CAPS1 high in the air, and there was a lot of practice involved. Next are the changes to the building, the building was not strong enough to hold the airship @ CAPS1 they are making @ MONEY1 in changes. They finally realized it was a dangerous idea, and it wouldn't be good with the highly flammable hielium, @ CAPS1 they were back to square 1. Then the government gave them a law that banned airships from flying. at low altitudes or over urban areas, which would make it illegal for airships to attach to the Empire State Building. And the upper floors have been turned into a soda fountain.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. Most of the problems encountered when designing the mast. They found they couldn't just drop a mooring mast from the top of the building a thousand feet away. The building was not strong enough, so they had to reinforce the building with a new steel frame. Then the builders were also faced with safety issues. At a thousand feet, the air currents were extremely violent. When construction was completed, it was quickly noticed that airships could not land on the Empire State Building.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of issues that prevented airships from landing there. It was too dangerous to tie airships to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that an airship moored to the mast of the building "would add stress to the frame of the building". However, this problem was quickly resolved, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to withstand the additional stress. Another reason the airships could not be attached to the Empire State Building is that airships are highly flammable when using hydrogen gas. It became evident that if an airship caught fire in downtown New York, it would be too terrible to risk. The airships could also not be attached to the mast as the winds at the top of the building would cause the stern of the ship to pivot around and around the mooring mast, which would not be safe. Finally, the airships could not be docked at the Empire State Building because "sharp arrows from other buildings in the area [could] pierce the hull of the airship." Airships couldn't fly that low without endangering people. The airships could not land at the Empire State Building because there were too many dangers.

Obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in constructing a proper mooring mast for zepplins and relating to the safety of the townspeople. They also had to take into account the weather and its impact on airships. The builders had to add more floors to the building and strengthen its base so that the mast could function properly and remain stable. then they ruled out using weights to anchor the airships in place because people on the street below. In addition, the chemicals in the airship were very flammable and put people at risk. Sometimes the winds were too strong for the airships to come close enough without being punctured. Builders faced obstacles that were impossible to overcome           

<START>

 

According to the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow the airships to dock there were a huge challenge for them. For example, Mother Nature herself was one of their huge challenges that they would mostly face. Atop the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to the strong air currents. As soon as an airship connected to the building, workers would have to find a way to prevent their airship from crashing into the building due to the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if an airship crashed anywhere on the ground, it would burst into hell because the interior of an airship is filled with hydrogen and helium. as he crashes to the ground.    

<START>

 

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were the lack of a suitable landing zone. They "will allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling, or service, and to get passengers on and off." Also, "the airships were tied up with a winch, @ CAPS1 that's what they did and had to tie up there.  

<START>

 

In @ ORGANIZATION1 there were many issues encountered during build. The way it all @ CAPS1 was when architect Al Smith wanted to make a building like no other, one taller than the new chrysler building and futuristic. The first problem they encountered was what was a building of this size used for? Where a lot of different ideas, but the one that came to Al @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 was transportation. This building could be used for a new type of transportation where people could board an airship "also known as an airship" at the very top of the building. the next issue was whether it could be done safely as they couldn't have a big problem in the middle of New York. The idea went to Washington for investigation and ended up not being sure enough. Al Smith didn't care, his building was the tallest.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced several hurdles in their attempts to allow airships to dock there. The first issue they encountered was the issue of security. Most airships were powered by hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This danger was demonstrated by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, and the owners of the building did not want to face a similar accident in a place as densely populated as New York. Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the strong wind at such an altitude would cause the stern of the ship to sway back and forth. This would not only be a technical issue, as it would also make it almost impossible for passengers to get in and out of the airship, and also make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship. In addition, ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to hang them over pedestrians. A final implication was that if airships docked at the Empire State Building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. For this reason, mooring a ship there would be illegal, which obviously would not help the project. In the end, these obstacles were the main reasons the company failed.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of those hurdles was that they had to modify the steel frame of the entire building so that it could withstand the added stresses and pressure of having an airship docked atop it. "The Empire State Building's steel framing would need to be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of alterations had to be made to the building's framing." Another obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was that airships were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen. The owners realized that this could be a bad idea when the Hindenburg caught fire. If this had happened at the Empire State Building, it would have had extremely drastic results. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire ... The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area. like downtown New York. " The biggest obstacle, however, was nature itself; "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents ... The stern of the ship swiveled around the mooring mast." @ CAPS1 were just three of the obstacles the Empire State Building builders faced in trying to allow airships to dock there.

When building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the builders @ CAPS1 have many challenges. If they had just put an arrow on top of the building. the weight of an airship could destroy it. The construction team needed to go back and reinforce the whole building frame. other obstacles in their path included low-flying aircraft laws, harsh weather conditions, and safety (should the derigible crash over New York). For all these reasons, the mooring mast was condemned from the start.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's "The Mooring Mast", she spoke of the obstacles encountered when trying to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. The three main obstacles were security, nature and existing laws. One of the biggest obstacles was security. Lüsted says: "... Never achieved his goal ... The biggest reason was for safety: most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. " Because hydrogen is highly flammable, there would be no way that would be safe. The building could catch fire and pose a danger to everyone. Second, nature itself would have an effect on airships. Lüsted says: “The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. Strong air currents could not allow airships to be on the Empire State Building because you cannot have airships with strong air currents. It's not sure. Finally, laws were a hurdle that builders had to face : Lüsted's knowledge is : " The other practical lesson that airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law against flying airships. too low above urban areas. " The law was a huge obstacle for builders who built airships. Because you can't build something against the law. Because of safety, nature, and the law, this is what keeps builders from building airships.                 

<START>

 

The @ CAPS1 that the builders of the Empire State Building faced while attempting to allow the airships to dock there were the high winds and the building struggled to stand. The builders struggled to get the building the way they wanted it. They continued to expand the building and make it bigger. The airships needed it to be bigger to be able to see it. The problem was that it kept breaking or something was wrong. They kept working on the building to try and get it right, but kept failing. They had to make their plans realistic and that was a major problem.      

<START>

 

According to the excerpt, some of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in leaving things docked were the law against air ships, safety and nature. There was a law that said planes were not allowed to fly that low. "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel." It was also dangerous because of the hydrogen in the airships. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." Nature was a factor because of the strong winds. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." Due to obstacles that engineers never thought of, the Empire Wtate building never became an airship landing.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles to allow the drigibles to moor there. One of the obstacles was the safety of New Yorkers. They could have used hydrogen and the airship could have caught fire and landed in the wrong place. As stated in paragraph @ NUM1, "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. Even if they were attached to the mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mast. Another was that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. The idea of using the mooring mast had quietly disappeared.

The builders faced many obstacles when trying to add a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building. As noted in paragraph fourteen, nature was the biggest obstacle faced by builders. The "strong drafts" would cause airships to rotate around the mooring mast, even if it was moored. Another obstacle encountered was that the architects could not simply add a mooring mast to the top of the building; more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications were made to the frame of the building. Finally, as noted in paragraph thirteen, most airships outside @ LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, even though it was flammable. When the German airship Hindenburg caught fire, the owners of the building realized the dangers of the situation.      

<START>

 

Manufacturers have encountered many obstacles. They couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat surface of the Empire State Building, it took a lot of stress and hard work. The airship was held by a single tether cable, and the airship was about a thousand feet in length. This made the builders very stressed and caused them to think clearly and carefully about the wind pressure and the load of the airships.   

<START>

 

There were some issues with the airships docked on the Empire State Building. One problem would be the foundation. If airships were to land on the building, it would put stress on the building's foundation, @ CAPS1 crushing it. The architects should have made adjustments to the Foundation for an airship to land. Another problem was the way the ship would be moored. when the vessel was moored it would be a danger as it would oscillate back and forth around the mast. Either causing damage or injury to the people of New York.

 There were many obstacles encountered while attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building. One of those obstacles was the wind currents at the top of the building. They were uncontrollable, powerful and unexpected. In @ CAPS1 @ NUM1, he explains how a US Navy airship attempted to dock but failed due to the winds, "The US Navy Los Angeles airship approached the mast. mooring but could not get close enough to moor due to high winds "(Lüsted) @ CAPS2 winds were a problem. Another problem was a law against airships that flew too close to the ground in urban areas. Not only was the idea dangerous, it was also illegal. On May 6, 1937, a German airship called the Hindenburg exploded in Lakehurst, New Jersey. This was due to the flammable hydrogen used to lift the airship. Since all airships of the time got hydrogen, another threat was introduced. It was luck that he exploded while trying to dock on the Empire State Building. If it exploded over many citizens, many lives would be in @ CAPS3. The idea of the mooring mast was now nonsense.

Airships, airships, were hailed as the means of transportation of the future in the 1920s. They had a top speed of eighty miles an hour and they could sail at seventy miles an hour over thousands. miles without needing to refuel. One of the hurdles that manufacturers faced was the lack of a proper landing zone. Al Smith spotted the opportunity for his Empire State Building. He was to add a mooring mast to the top of the building, allowing airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. Also, it let people come and go. The problem with this was that builders couldn't just place the mooring mast above the flat roof of the Empire State Building if a thousand-foot airship was moored to the top of the structure, held by a single tether. cable, it would add stress to the building frame.    

<START>

 

At @ DATE1, the Empire State Building was constructed and would be used to house a new form of travel. The mooring mast, built at the top of the building would be used to moor airships of a thousand feet; the future of travel. In theory, the airship would be moored to the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality there was no safe way to do it at such a high altitude. Another challenge encountered was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used. A single lit match could cause the steel frame to collapse to the ground. The soft fabric that covered the steel frame could easily be pierced, which was not suitable for an urban area. The men who built the airship either watched or forgot the elements of nature that limited this project. At the top of the building, the winds were reaching high speeds and rapidly changing direction, which would have struck the airship around the mast. The biggest obstacle was the law, preventing airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the story of the Empire State Building, one airship attempted to simulate a dock and another performed a press stunt. Any sane man would see that this project was doomed before it even got started.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. They consulted with experts, making tours of equipment and mooring operations in New Jersey. Architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast over the building, otherwise it would add stress to the building's framing. The stress of the load and would have been transmitted to the foundation of the building. The steel frame had to be modified and reinforced. The biggest obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would rotate around and around the mooring mast. You could weigh it down, but it would be suspended above pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe. There was also a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. And when they tried to deliver newspapers, they noticed it wasn't going to work

The builders had to deal with a lot of things. They had to rebuild the whole roof so the airships could dock there. Architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on top of the Empire State. An airship at the top of a building held by a single tether cable would add a lot of stress to the structure of the building. The Empire State Building's steel frame should be improved and reinforced. In addition, all these modifications would cost more than sixty thousand dollars to improve the structure of the buildings.

Having a building constructed over NUM1 feet tall and expecting airships / beacons to moor in it is dangerous and has many obstacles around. First, the weather is not always pleasant. If you have a windy day, the airship will swing over thousands of pedestrians in New York City. Putting lead blocks in the back would be very dangerous. you have lead in your back swinging with thousands of people below you. Second, most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and could destroy an entire building if the fire spread ... Finally, airships could not dock with the Empire State Building if it is illegal for an airship to hover too low towards urban areas. These are many reasons why airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems while attempting to allow airships to dock there. An airship of @ NUM1 feet would add stress to the structure of the building. Most airships in the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The Hindenburg accident also sounded the alarm. Hindenburg set Lakehurst, New Jersey, on fire. It showed the builders just how much worse the accident could have been if it had happened in a densely populated area like New York. Another factor was the wind currents. They were constantly @ CAPS1. This would make the back of the airship sway and move. There was also a pre-existing law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These are some of the reasons the builders have removed the obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. The first obstacle is described in paragraph @ NUM1, "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would exert pressure on the building frame." This means that they would need to reinforce the whole building. If they didn't, the building might fall. The following obstacle is described in paragraph @ NUM2, "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." This means the wind is so strong up there that it would take a while to land safely. Also, that the wind could blow the airship away. The @ CAPS1 obstacle is described in paragraph @ NUM3, "The other practical reason airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. . "That means they could be a target to destroy the building. Another thing is that if it ever fell it would kill a lot of people. These hurdles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were not overcome and the project was canceled.

Builders faced many obstacles to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. One obstacle was security. Foreign countries used highly flammable gases to fill their airships. According to the passage " When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place. above a densely populated area. like downtown New York. ” Another hurdle was whether. The winds at the top of the building were still turning due to the strong air currents. For example, the US Navy airship, Los Angeles, n was unable to dock to the mast because of the wind, which could lead to perforation of the hull of the airship. another obstacle was the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. According to the passage "This law would make it illegal to attach to the building or even to approach the area" ... Due to the many obstacles that the builders faced, the Empire State Building was unable to fulfill its original purpose , but is still considered a world landmark today.

In the article "The Mooring Mast" by @ ORGANIZATION2, @ CAPS1 describes several problems encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building when trying to allow airships there. For example, most airships (airships) outside the United States used hydrogen. , rather than helium. Since hydrogen is highly flammable and downtown New York City is heavily populated, if something were to go wrong it could impact the people of New York City, resulting in injury as well as death. Another reason is an existing law prohibiting the theft of airships too low over urban areas. This law even prohibits ships from approaching the area. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that might have been noticed before construction.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, the workers encountered some problems. One was how to do it @ CAPS1, because the architect who built the chrysler building had increased the overall height, making it the tallest building in the world. Former New York governor Al Smith said they would beat him by putting up a mooring mast for the airships. Another obstacle was @ CAPS2 the mast at the top of the frame. It couldn't be put on it, so sixty thousand dollars of maintenance had to be done on the frame. A third problem they had was attaching the airships, high winds could spin the airship, possibly puncture it. After the Hindenburg atrocity, officials did not allow airships to dock at the Building, for fear of endangering the public. Thus, the mast was never used.       

<START>

 

Those involved in the design and construction of the Empire State Building faced some major hurdles in trying to turn the idea of mooring airships into reality. One of the biggest complications was that if a massive airship were attached to the building by a “tether cable,” then stress would be placed on the building's frame. Builders and architects had to find a way to allow stress to move along the foundation of the building. They spent more than @ MONEY1 to modify the frame (From paragraph @ NUM1). In paragraph @ NUM2, we read that architects and builders overcame the storage hurdle by placing winches and control machines in the base of the "conical roof" shaft.

Although the dream of the builders of using the Empire State Building as a dock for airships was brilliant, the builders encountered many problems. One of the problems was the law prohibiting flying too low over urban areas like New York City. In addition, nature played a big part in the failure of their plan. Strong wind currents throughout the city affected the plan. Most airships landed in open fields where their rear end could be weighed down. This would be impossible when docked to the building, causing the airship to wobble and possibly collide with other buildings. The builders did not take into account the population density of New York City. If anything happened to a moored airship like the Hindenburg, many people would be affected. This is why the idea has always remained a dream.

The obstetrician that the builder took was tough and time @ CAPS1. In such a way that the only advantage, the Empire State Building really passed, was the tallest building in the world. They also attempted to @ CAPS2 the mooring base of an airship for future transport @ CAPS3 filed to do @ CAPS4 during certain legal and technical difficulties. Obstacles @ CAPS4 such as adding additional body work to the building structure were not even necessary.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow the airships to dock there. One obstacle was that a "thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building held by a single tether cable would add stress to the structure of the building." This is a very important obstacle because the frame becomes too stressed by the excessive waiting for the airship, the building could collapse. another obstacle is the wind. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents." This is also a major hurdle as the airships were very light lighter than air, so strong winds were swinging them so high in the air is not a sure thing, especially since downtown @ CAPS1 is below where there are thousands of people. And a third hurdle was the law banning low-flying airships over urban areas. It made it illegal to fly that low, to be able to tie the airship to the building.

According to the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. The author writes that "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring house was nature itself". (Lüsted, paragraph @ NUM1) It has been reported that the winds at the top of the building are constantly changing due to the strong drafts. An airship on the building could not land properly or be ballasted with lead weights like those on open airstrips. It would not be practical to hang weight above the heads of hundreds of people walking in the streets below. Along with nature itself, safety was another big hurdle that builders faced. It is written that " most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable " (Lüsted, paragraph @ NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, an accident could be extreme in a densely populated area like downtown New York where the Empire State Building was located. An accident had previously occurred with a German airship by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. In the end, nature and safety were two hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there.

What the builders face when trying to get airships to dock on the Empire State Building, one of them was nature. The winds at the top of the building were always changing causing strong drafts. Even if they were able to tie the front of airships to the building, the cable that holds it will put pressure on the building. The only way not to put pressure on the building was to modify it so that it could become more solid, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Even though they were able to bypass all of these obstacles, there is a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over the city. So, anyway, it couldn't have happened.

In "The Mooring Mast", author Marcia Amidon Lüsted discusses the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. First, the building's frame was not designed to withstand the mooring of a thousand-foot-long airship. Therefore, modifications should be made to make the building more solid. As the excerpt says, "over sixty thousand dollars worth of structural modifications had to be made." In addition, having airships moored to the building would be dangerous for a number of reasons. For example, airships were often filled with hydrogen rather than helium, and as the extract points out "hydrogen is highly flammable," the owners of the building realized that it could cause tragedy if an airship were to happen. crash as it flew over bustling New York City. streets. In addition, the strong winds at the top of the building made it difficult and dangerous to moor the airships to the mooring mast, as they constantly caused the stern of the ship to move. Finally, there were laws preventing planes from flying so low over the city. There were many obstacles in allowing airships to dock with the vessel.

The builders of the empire state building @ CAPS3 encountered many obstacles to allow airships to dock there. The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 had to be able to design the mast without having to rebuild a large part of the building. Another important aspect of this was that they had to face was being able to make it safe. These big airships can be very flammable and having something so big in a crowded city like New York would be very risky and dangerous. The last problem they @ CAPS3 was nature. Of course, you can't change nature, so this was a problem that had been around from the start, but probably overlooked or even never thought about. So, it really could never have worked successfully without any issues.

The issues the Empire State Building faced were a lot, for example it was never @ CAPS1 clearly because they didn't know the law that planes couldn't come @ CAPS2 in the suburbs and they really saw what could happen when The Hindenburg burned to the ground. Anthor the big obstacles they faced was nature because the winds at the top of the building were always spinning due to the strong air currents and that would cause the airship to rotate around the mooring mast. one last obstacle that was encountered was the structure of the airship because if it continued to land on top of the building, it would continue to destroy the structure of the building. These are some of the obstacles that have been encountered.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow the airship to dock there.

During the construction of the Empire Building, the builders encountered some problems. All of these problems or negatives for what they really wanted to do. Some of these problems were due to the composition of the ball. Most balloons used hydrogen instead of helium. In the snippet, they say "hydrogen is highly flammable" which could cause many deaths. Another was also the strong winds which could carry the ball and be difficult to handle. The last situation would be that there is a low flying vehicle law and the balloon flies low. In conclusion, the problems they had could not be resolved, so the plan was ruined.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was the law. There was "a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas" (¶ @ NUM1). While builders looked beyond that at first, they faced many other non-legal hurdles. There was also a safety issue with the mooring of airships, "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (¶ @ NUM2 ). A final hurdle that the builders faced was the wind. “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts ” (¶ @ NUM3). With all of these obstacles, it would not only be unlikely, but almost impossible to dock airships to the mast of the Empire State Building.

When Al Smith wanted to build a dock on the Empire State Building, he wasn't really thinking well. It was a horrible idea. Passengers would risk their lives getting on and off airships. He probably wasn't thinking about security issues and was just looking for looks. The obstacles he would encounter were the death of idiots climbing up there, the weather and @ CAPS1. The weather was a huge factor because if it was windy the airships could deviate from their course and crash. The @ CAPS1 to make this airstrip would also be crazy as they would have to buy all the floats and create a landing station. @ ORGANIZATION2 was not a smart guy to leave airships for landing.       

<START>

 

The biggest and most obvious obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building were safety factors, nature, and the city's law regarding low-flying airships. According to @ PERSON1's The Mooring Mast article, the biggest safety risk was that most airships manufactured / operated outside the US "used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable ”. (paragraph @ NUM1) @ CAPS1 a blimp filled with hydrogen to float above the densely populated @ ORGANIZATION2 would have been a dangerous risk. In 1937, a hydrogen airship caught fire and the result was disastrous; Empire State owners knew another crash like this over New York would have been much worse. At higher altitudes the winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the tail of the airship to pass. Normally the tail would be heavier, but the weights hanging over the city are not secure either. During one of the two failed attempts: when the building was moored, the winds were too strong for the airship to even approach the building. The airship captain feared "... that the wind would blow with the airship on the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area ..." (paragraph @ NUM2) and that could put a hole in the airship. Finally, a New York City law states that airships cannot fly below a specific altitude, making it illegal to dock an airship above the Empire State. Many apparent obstacles were overlooked in the planning of the Empire State Building's airship dock.

When constructing the mast for doc airships at the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles that led to the termination of this project. One inevitable hurdle was that most airships were filled with extremely flammable hydrogen, which could be detrimental to the condensed streets of New York City as well as the Empire State Building, should they explode. Also, the wind at the top of the building was uncontrollable and with the strong wind currents the mooring would be very dangerous. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." Although it is possible to attach weights to the back of the airship, it would be impractical and very dangerous for the public. Airships could not dock with the Empire State Building even though the docking station was completed due to a law in place that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. “ The still unresolved problems of mooring airships on a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone the final installation of the landing gear to a later date. The obstacles that stood in front of the mast of the Empire State Building were too large to optimistically believe the project could be completed, it was postponed and became obsolete with the invention of airplanes.

While trying to get airships to dock atop the Empire State Building, the architects encountered many obstacles. Usually, when faced with an obstacle, you either succeed or fail. In this case, these men did not overcome the obstacle. In the reading, it was mentioned that airships coming from outside the United States contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and can cause a lot of damage. Not only to the building itself, but also to the downtown New York neighborhood. The winds at the top of the building were moving due to the drafts. This could cause airships to circle around the mast even when stowed. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders had not realized how complicated the process of stowing an airship would be because of the high winds. Even the process of filing newspapers was difficult and time consuming.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems while attempting to allow airships to dock there. Start by putting a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. "The architects could not simply put a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building" (paragraph @ NUM1). They had to modify the metal frame of the building. They must have done this from the foundation of the building, "which was about eleven hundred feet below." (paragraph @ NUM1). It would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Once the mooring mast was built, the builders encountered more problems. Airships coming from outside @ LOCATION2 "used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (paragraph @ NUM3). The flammable airships were therefore too dangerous to fly over a place as populated as New York. Also, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were too strong. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast" (paragraph @ NUM4).

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there.

They couldn't let the accident that had happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey happen in New York : " ... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area. like downtown New York. ” The biggest obstacle was due to natural causes:“ The winds at the top of the building were consular moves due to strong drafts . ” The airship would not be able to staying stable for mooring or unloading. Other ideas for solving this problem, such as weights, were "neither practical nor safe." The last obstacle was the law. "The other practical reason for airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ” As noted, it was simply impossible for airships to dock with the Empire State Building due to natural causes, danger and the law itself.

They managed to overcome this hurdle. Another hurdle was safety.” Most airships outside the US used hydrogen rather than helium "@ CAPS1 any obstacles did this bring? Well, hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German airship was destroyed by fire in the New Jersey, the owners of "the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area.

Another obstacle that arose was nature, the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts. If the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would sway violently in the wind. Other airships moored in open fields added lead weights to the rear of them so they couldn't move. But there's nowhere to tie those weights to the top of the Empire State Building. One practical reason airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This law prohibited a vessel from mooring to the vessel. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to dock an airship

The builder of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of these problems (which was noticed after the mooring mast was built), was the difficulty of keeping an airship stable and attached to something without pulling the vessel on itself. Another issue was safety and one thing that was unsure about that was that most airships in other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable. Another reason was because of the high air currents which would propel the stern part of the ship uncontrollably.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. First of all, if a thousand-foot airship held by a single tether cable were tied to the top of the building, it would add stress to the frame. The workers were to transmit the strain " to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below." They had to modify and reinforce the frame, which cost more than sixty thousand dollars. They also had to design an ornamental four-wing mast to house the mooring arm. What the builders didn't realize was that their mooring mast not only had framing issues, but that the airship could pivot without being able to use lead weights to hold it down. There was nothing they could do to prevent that, the flammability or the existing laws.

There were three main reasons why the Empire State Building wouldn't serve well as a mooring mast for airships. On the one hand, it was dangerous. Most airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was too great. Especially in a very populated city. Two, strong drafts were present in and around New York City. Mooring an airship would be too difficult and if it were moored the wind would make it dangerous. Finally, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible to dock the airships to the Empire State Building. These three obstacles all helped explain why the Empire State Building couldn't serve as an airship mooring mast.

Marcia Amidon Lüsted, in her excerpt "The Mooring Mast", describes the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in trying to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle they should have faced was when designing the mast that would be placed on top of the building for mooring. "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." (¶ @ NUM1) They discovered that an airship docked at the top of the building would add too much stress to the building structure. Therefore, their first obstacle was to make changes that would strengthen the structure of the building. However, as Lüsted points out in paragraph @ NUM2, "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." Due to the violent drafts at the top of the building, the winds were constantly changing, causing even an airship attached to the mast to sway. Another problem was how to make airships heavier. In open airstrips, they weighed down airships with lead weights. Using extremely heavy weights while being above hundreds of people on the streets would not be acceptable. In conclusion, as can be seen, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow the airships to dock there.

When the builders attempted to build a structure to allow airships, or airships, to dock with the Empire State Building in New York City, they didn't realize how many problems they would encounter. When designing the mast above the building, the designers realized that if an airship were moored to the building, it would add stress to the frame and, therefore, would have to change the structure of the Empire State Building. To do this, sixty thousand dollars were needed, as well as more hours of work. Another obstacle encountered was the fact that nature opposed it, and "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts" (line @ NUM1). It would be difficult to tie it to the building, as the airship would constantly sway from the wind and passengers would not be able to get on the airship. Additionally, airships were typically moored in open fields, using lead weights to help weigh them down. If lead weights were introduced to New York City, where it was densely populated, they could potentially fall while swaying in the air, putting pedestrians at risk. In conclusion, the builders faced a lot of obstacles while trying to get mooring capability for airships on the Empire State Building.

There were many obstacles facing the Empire State Building @ CAPS1, one of them was redesigning parts of the Empire State Building. @ CAPS1's job was to create the mast to moor new airships called airships or airships. This plan came with great difficulty, they could not fall on the mooring mass above the flat roofs of the Empire State buildings. They came to understand that "a thousand foot airship moored by a single tether cable would add stress to the structure of buildings" (paragraph @ NUM1). This stress should be transmitted to the foundation of the buildings. The @ CAPS1 had to modify and reinforce the steel structure in order to adapt to the stress situation on the building frame. By also creating the rocket shaped mass, the @ CAPS1 had to work on many different parts. Winches and control machines for mooring the airship. It had to be done quickly for everything to work. These were the obstacles the @ CAPS1 faces in attempting to allow the airships to dock in the Empire State Building.                 

<START>

 

The main problem they had with mooring airships was that it had to be really secure. To keep the plane on the ground, they would have to use lead weights. Weights fell from the top of the building in an area so dense and populated that it would be very dangerous. Additionally, when the owners of the Empire State learned of the Hindenburg explosion, they felt uncomfortable. Even if the plane floated docked at the top of the building, the wind would whip it, making it even more dangerous. The idea was good, but not likely to be sure.     

<START>

 

During the construction of the Empire State Building, obstacles were encountered in an attempt to allow airships to dock with it. For example, architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's frame. Architects must therefore shape it and strengthen the building. Spend over sixty thousand dollars for the new motivation. The building will move from floors @ NUM1 to 102. From there, airship passengers will board from there. In conclusion, during the construction of the Empire State Building, obstacles were encountered in an attempt to allow airships to dock there.

Numerous issues made it impossible to use the Empire State Building mast as a dock for airships. One was that many foreign airships were filled with hydrogen, a very flammable gas. If one caught fire like the Hindenburg, it would cause a lot of drama as it would be over people's houses. For the same reason, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over cities. “This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area.” @ CAPS1 risks to the safety of people below, there was wind causing a problem the airship could not not even dock properly. "Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship could pivot." One of the attempts proved that it would be difficult to land. The Los Angeles attempted to reach the building, but withdrew the idea due to the wind. The captain feared that he could fly in one of the arrows of a large building and that the airship could be punctured. "[He] couldn't even take his hands off the joystick."

In the article The Mooring Mast from @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1, she describes the difficulties in designing the mast for airships to moor atop the Empire State Building. Al Smith, the mayor of New York at the time of the Empire State Building, came up with the idea of adding a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York a technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed, the designers discovered problems with the installation of the mast. They found out that they were going to have to modify the steel framing because if a thousand foot airship docked at the top of the building would transmit stresses all the way through the framing to the foundation. due to wind load and pressure. The wind speed at the top of the building would cause the airship to blow in the wind, it is very dangerous to be near a building.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast, many problems were encountered to allow airships to dock there. The obstacles encountered would endanger the safety of people. One of the problems was that the tail of the airships swirled due to the height at which the wind was strong. Another problem that was stated in paragraph @ NUM1 was that the fake airships were made with hydrogen instead of helium, so they were flammable.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. When designing the mast, they did not realize that the mast would "add stress to the framing of the building" and to solve this problem they would have to pay "over sixty thousand dollars" for modifications to the framing of the building. building. Another problem they encountered, besides the fact that there was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas", "the winds at the top of the building were constantly turning". This did not allow the airships to come close enough to moor, for fear that "the wind would blow the airship on sharp arrows" which would damage the airship's hull. Another problem encountered by the builders was realized when the Hindenburg was destroyed in New Jersey, due to the fact that "hydrogen is extremely flammable". They realized how dangerous it was to have an accident like this "over a densely populated area". And so, the builders were forced to stop their work.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems while attempting to dock airships. Most of these issues were security issues. One of the problems was the use of hydrogen, which is a highly flammable and explosive gas. An acid fire would be catastrophic, as downtown New York City is densely populated. Another problem was that the tail of the airship could not be heavier as usual, because then there would be huge weights hanging in the streets. With the winds blowing and the airship not securely attached and not ballasted, the airships would have swayed and moved. This creates the risk that the airship will be punctured by sharp edges on other buildings. Also, if the airship docked successfully, it would put enormous stress on the vessel. Besides the technical issues, there were some obvious hurdles which, oddly enough, were never addressed or resolved. The first being a law banning low-altitude airship flights over urban centers. It even makes it illegal to attempt to land, meaning there was never a chance the mooring mast would work. The second problem was that the correct mooring equipment was never installed. This meant that no attempt could ever succeed. The builders faced many obstacles in building the mast, but the biggest obstacle was the lack of preparation, the inability to solve the obvious problems.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered two obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. The first obstacle was the strong winds. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. Even tying the airship to the mooring mast would cause the stern of the ship to pivot dangerously around the mooring mast. The second obstacle was due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law prohibited a vessel from mooring to the vessel or even approaching the area.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were @ CAPS1. In @ CAPS2 @ NUM1, it is stated that "more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the building". This @ CAPS3 that the mast designs were going to take time. Another obstacle almost called the end of the mooring mast. In @ CAPS2 @ NUM2 Architects @ CAPS5, "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was intended to never complete its @ CAPS6 pose, for obvious reasons even before it was built." The main reason was for safety : most airships outside @ LOCATION3 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ” @ CAPS7 it was such a huge @ CAPS8 that the owners have thought about the densely populated area of New York and how people might get hurt.

The obstacles that the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building were, first of all, the structure of the buildings was not strong enough, the winds were too strong and the law. The building structure could not contain an airship of @ NUM1 feet. The winds would cause the airship to move, which could also ruin the structure of the building. The law also said that airships could not fly too low over a city. These are some of the obstacles that workers faced during the construction of the Empire State Building.    

<START>

 

When setting out to build a mast for docked airships, the architects encountered many obstacles that made the idea of a mooring mast implausible. One obstacle they encountered was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city. If the airships were tied to the building with a tether, then the stern would be free to sway and sway. Another factor they had to take into account was that the airships were full of flammable hydrogen gas which posed the risk of a serious fire hazard in New York City. Even if the engineers and architects succeeded in solving all the problems associated with the construction of the mast, they would still face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly airships at low altitudes over urban areas. These are the reasons why the idea of a dock for airships never came to fruition.      

<START>

 

The Empire State Building's @ CAPS1 encountered many obstacles. By allowing airships to dock there, they had to build @ CAPS2 facades on the side of the building, which meant they would be life threatening. They also had to deal with electrical problems inside and outside the building. The @ CAPS1 outside the building should face strong wind currents. They must also ensure that the electrical system is functioning properly. If there were to be some kind of fire, the hydrogen and helium would be extremely flammable, and if one wire was too short, it could ignite like the whole airship and it would explode.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow the airships to dock there. Some of the obstacles were safety factors and nature itself. Safety was a big hurdle in this morning mast project, as airships use hydrogen to float these large ships. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad it would be if airships were to ignite above a densely populated city like New York City. “Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on 6 May 1937, the owners realized how much worse this accident could have been. been in New York. "The biggest obstacle was nature. Humans couldn't control the wind and above the building they were constantly changing, making docking difficult. "The winds above the building were constantly moving due to the strong air currents." The mooring mast could not be made.

A mooring mast was added to the top of the building where it would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and allow passengers to get on and off. The airships were moored by an electric winch. The bodies of the airships swayed in the breeze. A group of engineers in New York tried to boost a practice. They worked very hard. Government folks in Washington were featured on an @ ORGANIZATION1 of airships moored to the mast. They eventually managed to accomplish what they were trying to accomplish by building a mooring mast so that airships had a place to land for fuel and service.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock. According to an excerpt, one of these obstacles was the lack of a suitable landing pad. Airships were up to a thousand feet long, the same length as four city blocks in New York City. Another obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area. The US Navy Los Angeles airship approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to moor because of the high winds. If they got close enough to tie up, the captain couldn't even remove his hands from the control levers lest the wind would blow the airship at the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area, piercing the airship hull. In addition, for the airship to be added, more than sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framing of the buildings.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the airships to dock on the building. They first had to make sure the mast was not too heavy to put on the building and when they realized it was they made @ MONEY1 some modifications to the building so it could support the mast. They also had to make sure it was safe, by transporting people through that airship. It depended on the wind and the weather. They also had to make the building taller than the Chrysler building. They wanted to transform the new transport @ CAPS1. In the end, they realized that docking on the building was not possible if they wanted to keep everything safe for the public.

The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose for reasons such as safety, nature, and the law. The main reason was safety, as most airships coming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. The German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937. The accident could have been much worse if it had happened in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Nature was the biggest obstacle to get around as the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong drafts. This would rotate the stern of the ship. This is not good because it would be hanging above the pedestrians on the street. Finally, there are laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area. In conclusion, for these three major reasons, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was doomed never to fulfill its function.

Obstacles encountered by the builder of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were noticing that the airships would be suspended dangerously above pedestrians on the street. There was a lot of risk when landing huge airships and also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law even prohibited a vessel from approaching the area. Famous and important airships have had great difficulty in landing, for example in December 1930, the US Navy Los Angeles airship approached the mooring mask but could not get close enough because strong winds. The airship could move uncontrollably and crash into the Sharp Spiers on other buildings around it. In @ CAPS1 to become the transport of the future, airships had given way to airplanes.

The obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building to allow airships to moor there are many, it is mainly a security problem. " The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts ," the article said. "They would be hung over pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical nor safe."

In the story "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, there were many issues to be faced in allowing airships to dock above the Empire State Building. These obstacles are made up of the airships themselves, the winds of nature, and the laws that prevent airships from docking. Some out-of-state airships used hydrogen, a flammable gas, and could cause massive destruction in New York City due to their roughly four block length in New York City. The wind made the airships rotate even after they were tied up. Since there was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas", this could lead to the arrest of the airship captain.

In this excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to dock the airships there. One of the obstacles they faced was that they lacked a suitable landing zone. For this reason, they came up with the idea of getting the passengers of the airship up and down by descending a gangway to an open observation deck. Another obstacle they faced was that " the strain of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below ." Another main obstacle that the builders faced was that " the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation ". In the end, the idea of the mooring mast was a failure. The builders didn't think about the potential problems that could arise. For example, nature itself, the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and even fires, caused by the gas (hydrogen) used in some airships.           

<START>

 

If the Empire State Building were to dock the airships, there would be many problems. They lacked a landing zone for an airship of nearly a thousand feet. This airship held by a single tether to the Empire State Building would put a great amount of stress on the building's structure, risking a possible collapse if continued. If they were to use the Empire State Building, they would have to modify it and use thousands of dollars in the process. Even then, if the airship clung to the building, the rear of the airship would sway with the high winds and this could endanger the safety of the passengers. All in all, the idea of landing an airship on a gigantic building is just a bad idea.     

<START>

 

Docking the airship would have been a great addition to the Empire State Building. Architects had to overcome many obstacles to achieve this goal. The building was not strong enough. If they had attached an airship to the top of the original Empire State building, he would have pulled the building until it felt finished. The architects had to improve the frame to make it safe. Now that the cadre was safe, they had to worry about the airship itself. If only one end of the airship was attached to the mast, the other end would be blowing in the wind. This would make the unloading of cargo and people very difficult. Airships could also catch fire, which was uncertain. for the people in the field. In the and he just wasn't sure whether to dock an airship at the Empire State Building.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Al Smith, the manager of this project, aimed to build the tallest building. Right from the start, the first problem arose. The Chrysler Building had a 185ft Secret Spire inside and made this building now @ DATE2, 46ft taller than the Empire State Building. The first sign of hope shone on Al when he saw an opportunity for the Empire State Building. Airships needed a landing zone. and the mooring mast does the trick. The mast, added to the top of the building, allows the airships to anchor for a while to refuel and be serviced. This design took a long time to develop + quickly became bad. Safety was a factor. Most airships, from outside @ LOCATION2. operated on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accidents. For example, on May 6, 1937, a German airship was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like this happened in a heavily populated area like @ CAPS1 then there would be a problem. These are some of the many obstacles encountered while constructing the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. Obstacles included security issues, nature and the law. Safety concerns were an issue because in the snippet it says that "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." This explains why they couldn't do it because one of the airships would explode in downtown New York, it would cause serious damage and loss of life as it is a populated area. Another obstacle was nature. Nature played its part because "the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts". This would have rotated the rear of the airships, which was either convenient or safe. The last hurdle was that there was a law on airships flying low over urban areas. This would have made it illegal to tie a ship to the Empire State Building. These obstacles had put builders in trouble to allow airships to land on the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. The first big obstacle was the design of the mast. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building; it had a flat roof. If an airship was moored, it would add additional stress to the frame, and wind pressure would be a factor as well. The mooring mast was never intended to fulfill the role of landing airships, as it is not safe, nature (airship with swivel at the rear) it could possibly be weighed down by lead to the rear but which cannot be suspended above pedestrians in the street. One practical reason they couldn't dock was a special law already in place against planes flying too low. Although this had happened, two airships had attempted to dock with it, the first had turned around due to bad weather conditions and the second was due to a publicity stunt dropped newspapers before the landing gear could not be installed, so they had to use a wire to receive them. As a result, the idea was abandoned.        

<START>

 

The obstacles encountered by the manufacturers were mainly safety. Security was important because of the number of people in New York City. Another problem was that airships outside of the United States were hydrogen instead of helium. At such a high height, the wind is very strong and airships are held only from the front while the rear would sway uncontrollably. An airship can easily be blown into the sharp arrows of a nearby building and burst due to the winds. There are a lot of things that can go wrong at any time, so I think the right decision was to stop the mooring mast idea.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced are the airships being moored by means of an electric winch, which pulled in line from the front of the ship, then tied it to a mast.

Well, airships were airships flying low over the city and over urban areas. In addition, the US @ ORGANIZATION2 approached the mooring mast to moor but the winds were too strong. also a Goodyear Blimp Columbia. Attempted publicity stunt where he tied up and delivered a bundle of newspapers.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to secure the mooring of the airships. The top three issues they faced were adding stress to construction, safety, and city laws. The Empire State Building was already huge and fragile, so adding a long way to it wouldn't have helped, "a @ DATE1 foot airship moored to the top of the building held by a single tether wire would add stress to the frame. of the building. " The architects couldn't want it, they had to make changes. Before making the changes, they also realized that it was very windy up there," the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts ". @ CAPS1 it would be safe to be up there, never knowing how bad the winds would be. So they decided to shorten the building. After all the work they did , that was still not good enough because there was a law that was “against airships flying too low over urban areas.” After all the time and hard work they put in, there was no had, in the end, no way to make this idea succeed.

There were airships that were a thousand feet long and they had one obstacle which was that they didn't have a lot of space in New York to land. Al Smith decided it was a good idea to let the airships dock at the top of his building for a few hours to "refuel or serve, and let the passengers get on and off." But the airships were moored by an electric winch that attached the ship to the mast. Airships would sway and people would always get on and off safely. Empire State Building architects and engineers worked / discussed with experts and secured "US Naval Air Base" equipment and docking operations. whose Navy was the leader in the development of airships in the United States and knew everything. The Navy offered its airships to be used for testing the mast. The architect also met with the president of an airship transport company that offered airship service across the Pacific Ocean. so the builders had many obstacles and attempts to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's clip "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was trying to dock an airship at the top without too much stress on the vessel. He says, “ The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. " It means they plan to solve this problem by distributing the stress to the building foundation. Another obstacle encountered was trying to keep the airships from moving and swaying too much, once they were docked. He said, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts." It was impossible to prevent the airships from moving because the wind was so strong. The final problem was that even though they could dock an airship to the building, it was illegal to fly the airships this low in an urban area. "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel." In conclusion, all of these hurdles that the builders faced led to the end result of failure.

The Empire State Building faced many challenges before becoming @ ORGANIZATION1. They were afraid that other people would destroy this building. They therefore reduced the airships to dock there. They wanted their city to become a famous city and earn more money. And another problem, some people didn't care and put it off.

The idea of mooring a thousand-foot-long airship to a mast eleven hundred feet above the ground never seemed possible. From the factual evidence provided in paragraphs @ NUM1 and @ NUM2, the theory is a proven failure. "Airships outside of the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable." If an airship caught fire while trying to tie up to the Empire State Building, the accident would quickly turn into a disaster. "The biggest obstacle was nature itself." The high-speed, shifting winds atop the Empire State Building would cause the mooring airships to jerk around the mast. Another obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the law prohibiting aerial vessels from flying too low over urban areas. A problem which would condemn the theory from the outset.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow airships to dock there. On the one hand, they were mainly "hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable". A fire in one of them would be devastating for a huge city like New York. Wind currents would also make it impossible to dock there. “The ship would pivot around the mooring mask,” and could even potentially pierce the frame. The idea was dangerous and risky. In fact, it would have been illegal to steal "too low over urban areas." Not only was it dangerous, but also against the law. Overall, it is the barriers workers face and the barriers that prevail in the long run.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, builders encountered many obstacles to allow airships to tie up to the mooring mast. In the article "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the author gives us examples of what was difficult. One obstacle to mooring airships to the mast was the safety of people inside. The article says: "The biggest reason was safety." He goes on to say "Most airships from the United States used hydrogen, hydrogen is highly flammable." another reason was nature. The author states that “ the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts. " This would lead to a departure unsafe passengers. The article also reads "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot," showing dangerous weather conditions. These are two obstacles that made landing at the mooring mast very difficult and soon impossible.           

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Airships were not safe in a city like New York due to the strong wind currents at the top of the building that would cause the airships to rotate around and around the mooring mast. Many airships from outside the United States were also filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there were an accident like the one in the Hindenburg in New York, it wouldn't be just the passengers who would be injured. Another obstacle was that there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law even prohibited ships from approaching the Empire State Building.

Based on the snippet, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with issues such as a lot of wind movement, a lot of weight, and a lot of safety hazards. when they tried to clear the airships to dock there. The movement of the wind moved the airships when they tried to dock, which would have caused them problems. They would also have weight issues as they did not have a sufficiently stable structure around the building. They would have to pay a lot of money to fix this problem. The last issue was a security issue. After the explosion of the German airship Hindenburg, they realized that it was too dangerous to have airships landing over crowded cities. problems.

Based on the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced the obstacles of using hydrogen in highly flammable airships, nature itself and of an existing law to attempt to allow airships to dock there. He said in paragraph @ NUM1 of the snippet, most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Realizing that this kind of event was happening over an extremely populated area like New York would be extremely dangerous. To explain. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized just how much worse the accident would have been had it happened in- above a densely populated area such as downtown New York ". However, the biggest obstacle was nature itself. At the top of the building, the winds were constantly changing. which was certainly not certain. For example, “ Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. " The manufacturers have quickly realized that this problem could unfortunately not be solved. Finally, a more apparent obstacle that manufacturers faced was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for ships to even approach the area. The obstacles of the use of hydrogen, nature itself and an existing law, made it impossible for Al Smith to become realistic.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was the "violent drafts". Because of these currents, it became very difficult to allow an airship to land on top of the Empire State Building, without blowing off. Another obstacle was security. The airships were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is a very flammable object and if an accident were to occur, a flaming balloon flying over a densely populated area of New York could become very dangerous. While the idea of making airship docking stations is a good idea, there are too many obstacles and dangers that keep it from happening.      

<START>

 

The builders faced many hurdles in an attempt to ensure the airships could dock at the Empire State Building. For example, the first problem that arose was the construction of the mast at the top of the building. According to the snippet, "A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's framing." From there, you immediately know that the Empire State Building's framing would have to be properly altered in order for the airship to dock to the mast safely and successfully. Another minor problem was to give the whole building a decorative appearance. "... the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within ..." @ CAPS1, "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. " @ CAPS2, the winds at this altitude would have been too unstable for an airship to dock. The problem is that the winds could potentially “tip” the stern of the airship around the mast, which is extremely dangerous and risky.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, builders encountered many obstacles in an attempt to allow an airship to dock with it. These problems consisted of security and practical matters. one safety concern was that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen was more flammable than helium. This led to the Hindenburg a German airship to be destroyed by fire. "Most dirigibels outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." The builders also had practical problems such as it was illegal to fly an airship too low over a city. “The other practical reason why airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to even dock. to the building. " These obstacles prevented the hops from landing on a building.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to let the airships dock there. One obstacle that manufacturers faced was the "lack of a suitable landing zone". (paragraph six) A second obstacle is the amount of stress that an airship would place on the vessel. As the author indicates in paragraph nine, " the stress of the load of airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundations of the buildings ". The author also states that for the invention to work, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to have more strength and would have to be modified to fit the new idea. The biggest obstacle encountered was due to the nature of the location of the building. Due to the location the winds were so strong and the wind was constantly shifting. The latest hurdle that manufacturers faced was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas." By the end of the 1930s, the idea of landing airships on the Empire State Building disappeared. Instead, the idea of air travel was given to airplanes.

The obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building made the construction of the Mooring difficult. One of the issues they faced was that most airships made outside of @ PERSON1 used hydrogen rather than helium. In paragraph @ NUM1 it is written "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse it would be if it happened in New York City, which is very populated ". The obstacle @ CAPS1 was Mother Nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. In paragraph @ NUM2, the author states that "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". The final hurdle was laws banning airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @ NUM3, the author states that "this law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even to approach the area".

Obstacles such as the nature, safety concerns and the weight as well as the length of the airship were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow airships to dock there. They were very optimistic about having the Empire State Building, "equipped for an era of transportation then only the dream of aviation pioneers", until they saw the risks. . The first was nature itself, the winds were constantly changing due to strong drafts. This means that the airship, which was designed to be "lighter than air", would pivot around the mooring mass. and have no weight support to keep it down. Sometimes winds can even prevent the airship from getting close enough, as in @ DATE1 when a US Navy airship named Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but was unable to approach it. enough. Another issue with security. It has been stated that outside of the United States, most airships use hydrogen instead of helium, which was used in the United States. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which is a very dangerous asset when there are millions of people underneath. When the owners of the Empire State Building heard about the German airship Hindenburg being destroyed by fire, they imagined the situation above New York City which was very populated. Finally, the size and weight of the airship itself. The airship (@ NUM1 ft) held by a single cable would add stress to the structure of the building. In order to avoid this, they should modify the frame. These obstacles and many others showed that this idea was " never destined to achieve its goal ."

The builders of the Empire State Building face some challenges when trying to build a dock for airships. One of the main problems was that it was clearly dangerous because airships from outside the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and they didn't want to have another crash like the Hindenburg. They realized that if an accident like this had happened in a densely populated area like New York, it would have been a thousand times worse.

How safe is it to have a large airship @ CAPS1 above thousands of civilians ? The builders had many issues to contend with in attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building. On the one hand, the mast was not even said ready in this excerpt "to fix a mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone it to a later date ". The landing gear was also not yet ready or safe to operate. The idea of using airships in such a populated area was not even considered smart enough.

A third obstacle was that there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area. Fortunately, by the end of the 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for airships was quickly gone and builders had no more obstacles to face.

The idea of Hindenburg-sized aerial ships landing on top of the Empire State Building seems provocative these days. However, in the 1920s, it was a dream for many. Unfortunately, this dream never came true due to the multiple obstacles encountered by the manufacturers. The first obstacle encountered by the manufacturers concerned what was in the airship itself, the hydrogen. This would be a problem because the vast majority of airships visiting "have used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." So if an accident "had taken place over a densely populated area like downtown New York," it could be catastrophic. Another major problem was the winds. They were "constantly moving because of the strong air currents" so ships could tip over into other buildings. Those two points aside, there was a "law against airships flying too low over urban areas" anyway. So no matter the wind or the hydrogen, it wasn't legal. These three obstacles combined made the dream of airships landing in New York City a dream, not a reality.

In the story "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock. The huge balloon caused tension and stress due to its gigantic size. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of a building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." The stress of the airship, can cause crucial damage to the framework of buildings. Furthermore, it was not just the size of the contents of some of the planes that also caused the crisis. "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." The worry of the balloon burning was too risky. With everything, is the power of nature itself. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." The winds at the top of the building were very strong compared to those in the ground causing fear. Everything looked good until everything looked carefully, obstacles were coming in all kinds of ways.

In the clip, The Mooring Mast by @ ORGANIZATION2, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The majestic spire of the Empire State Building is familiar to many people around the world, but few know that the mast's original purpose was to serve as a landing point for airships also known as airships. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of obstacles. It's proven when it says "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building ... A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building held together by a single Tether cable. , would add stress to the Buildings framework. They took the risk of having the airships attached to the Empire State Building, which can put pressure on the building that may soon catch on. Another @ CAPS1 who proves Empire State builders faced, “The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.” The winds at the top of the building made it dangerous. clearly, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced.

In @ ORGANIZATION2's The Mooring Mast excerpt, builders faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. In paragraph @ NUM1 of the excerpt, it says: "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame." The stress of the wind and the weight of the airship should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, about eleven hundred feet below. In paragraph @ NUM2 of the excerpt, it is stated that "most airships ... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable". If another disaster happened like the Hindenburg (which was destroyed by fire) in a densely populated area like New York, above a large building with lots of people, it would be a thousand times worse. The winds above the Empire State Building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents. This left the designers with the problem of an airship swinging around the mooring mast. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ ORGANIZATION2 the builders faced so many obstacles that they finally abandoned the project.

On December 11, 1929, Al Smith came up with the idea of making the Empire State Building the tallest building in the United States. He wanted to surpass the Chrysler Building, Smith wanted it to be 1,250 feet. His idea was to add a mooring mast. However, problems arose, such as the degree of flammability of airships, the population density of the city and high winds. Airships are highly flammable because they contain both hydrogen and helium. on May 6, 1937, a German airship was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. New York City welcomes millions of tourists a day to an area so populated, what if something goes horribly wrong. The biggest problem was nature. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents… the stern of the ship swiveled around the mooring mast." (@ CAPS1, @ NUM1) On May 6, 1937, the building's owners concluded that efforts to make the Empire State Building the tallest building were neither practical nor safe.

In the attempt to allow airships to dock in the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. One of those obstacles was to modify the whole structure of the building. "A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's framing ... The steel framing of the Empire State Building would have to be altered and reinforced to accommodate this. new situation. " This quote from the snippet makes it clear that builders would have to work around that to get their job done, which would make this situation an obstacle entirely. Another obstacle encountered by workers was nature itself. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." This quote shows another hurdle as builders couldn't find a practical way to get passengers off, and putting lead in the back would only endanger pedestrians below. The last hurdle that manufacturers faced was everyone's safety. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." This quote shows a very big obstacle, which actually happened to the German airship Hindenburg. These were the obstacles workers faced when attempting to dock airships to the Empire State Building.

Many obstacles arose for the builders of the Empire State Building and allowed the airships to dock there. One of those obstacles was the mooring mast itself. The winds atop the Empire State Building were constantly changing and if the airship was attached to the mooring mass, it would pivot around the mooring mast. Another obstacle that manufacturers encountered during this process was the already existing law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. Due to the fact that the Empire State Building was located in New York, an urban area, the idea of the airship probably would never have worked. The airship could not fulfill its destiny and the obstacles encountered by the builders were the main reasons.

There are a few hurdles that builders face during this time when constructing the Empire State Building. One of the problems was the unresolved issues of mooring airships to secure a mast at a desirable height to postpone installation to a later date. The Empire State Building was not intended to fulfill its mission. For reasons, it should have been visible before it was built. And another obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing zone.

There were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the reasons was one of the sefty. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." If an accident were to happen over a densely populated area like New York, it would be catastrophic. Another obstacle was nature itself. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as weather, chemistry, and construction issues in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. For example, the height of the building meant that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts." Due to the strong wind currents, the stern of airships constantly circled around the mast. Another problem that the Empire State Building builders faced was the gas that most airships were made of. Most airships outside the country were made from hydrogen gas - an incredibly flammable gas. This problem was presented by the German airship Hindenburg which was destroyed by fire. With this misfortune, the owners of the Empire State Building remarked "how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area like downtown New York." With this realization, the builders of the Empire State Building finally realized that an airship suspended above the street was neither safe nor a practical idea. Finally, the construction of the building itself posed the obstacles to the attempt to allow airships to dock there. Airship load stress and wind pressure would put stress on the structure of the building and be incredibly expensive to modify. However, the builders fixed this problem at a cost of sixty thousand dollars. Unfortunately, the other construction issues were too great.

Complex. A building is a complex structure which cannot be easily tampered with and which is nevertheless considered to be safe. This is the major problem for manufacturers. It's not easy, you "can't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). They had to strengthen the structure and it took “sixty thousand dollars in modifications” (¶ @ NUM1). In addition, the builders had to design a nice plan for the mast, to make it look pretty. They even had to use glass, a more difficult material to work with. Although the biggest obstacle encountered by the builders was allowing the airship to dock. One of them was filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and if it had exploded it would have killed a lot of people in the city. However "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself" (¶ @ NUM3). This was mentioned in @ CAPS1 @ NUM3 and is the main reason the idea failed. The winds were always constantly changing, causing the back to rotate and become dangerous. Weights on his back would have made him even more dangerous, as they could fall. Finally laws prevented theft so close to the ground. But even so many other airships have tried, like "Columbia" and "Los Angeles", and found it too difficult to fly so close to the building and the dock. The idea had many holes.               

<START>

 

In the snippet, they explain a few reasons why it would be difficult for airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. In paragraph 6, it says: “ The airships were moored by means of an electric winch, which was pulled in line from the bow of the ship and attached to a mast. The body of the airship could sway in the breeze, and yet the passengers could safely get on and off the airship by descending a gangway from the observation deck. " This shows how potentially dangerous it could be for the passengers of the airship. down. another reason was that airships were losing passengers in the late 1930s because of the plane. as stated in paragraph @ NUM1, "in the late 1930s, the idea of using Mooring masts for airships and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Airships, instead of becoming the transport of the future, had given way to airplanes. ” This quote shows that airships were losing popularity because of the airplane.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when they attempted to build a mast to allow airships to dock there. First of all, some airships were very flammable because they use hydrogen instead of helium. A German airship named Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire and once the Empire State Building noticed how much worse it could have been in a more populous place like New York, their hopes fell a bit. Another obstacle was an obstacle that could not be fixed, as it was caused by nature. It was the strong winds. The excerpt read that “ Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. " The only solution was to put the weight of lead on the back, but they would then be suspended over pedestrians, which is certainly not safe. The last thing that stopped them was a law that banned any airship that flew too low in urban areas. Overall, builders faced too many obstacles to build an airship mast

The builders had many hurdles to overcome when trying to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles was the lack of a suitable landing pad. This obstacle didn't stop Al Smith, he saw it as an opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building so the airships could anchor there. This idea caused another obstacle, a mooring mast could not be dropped on the roof of the building. The stress of the load and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundations of the buildings. With this, the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and reinforced at a cost of @ MONEY1 just to change the frame. In the end, that mooring mast for mooring airships never passed and the architects should have seen the potential problems early on.

In the Mooring Mast, Marcia explains how Al Smith attempts to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to allow airships (airships) to park for several hours. Architects faced many obstacles when trying to add a pole to the design of the Empire State Building. One of those hurdles was to renovate the building so that the weight of the airship would not stress the foundations. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." (¶ @ NUM1) Another obstacle that delayed the progress of airships docking atop the Empire State Building was due to security concerns. Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium. And because New York was so heavily populated, there was no doubt that there would be frequent fires. Even the owners of the Empire State Building realized this danger on May 6, 1937.       

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building, who wanted to place a mooring mast on top of the building, encountered many obstacles in their attempts to allow airships to dock there. One of those obstacles was security. Most airships at the time used highly flammable hydrogen, and if a single spark got into the balloon, the entire airship would catch fire. Eventually, the owners of the Empire State Building realized just how much [an] accident could [be] if it took place over a densely populated area like downtown New York, ”and halted construction of the mooring mast. Another obstacle was that " the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong air currents " which would " rotate the airship around and around the mooring mast." A third reason was that, even if there was a way to keep the airship still against all that air pressure, all the stress of holding that airship still "should be passed down to the foundation of the building."       

<START>

 

The first major hurdle that builders faced was the fact that airships, even though they have propellers and rudders, are always at the mercy of the wind. And since the wind at the top of the building has been described as " constantly changing due to the strong drafts " (¶ @ NUM1), it would be impossible to keep the airships steady while docked on the Empire State Building. . Just mooring the airship on the building was an impossible footing, the only airship that even tried to moor on the Empire State Building, the Los Angeles naval airship could not get close enough to the building to set up the moorings because they were “fearing that the wind would blow the airship on the sharp arrows of the other building in the area, which would pierce the hull of the airship. ” (¶ @ NUM2) causing the airship to fall onto the airship. The second main obstacle was the public safety aspect of trying to dock an airship on the Empire State Building. There were too many things that could go wrong. The airship could explode like the Hindenburg, or could strike the spiers from surrounding buildings and crashed to the ground, killing or seriously injuring hundreds of people, so trying to dock an airship on the Empire State Building was such an impractical idea.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's excerpt "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow the airships to dock there. These obstacles were security reasons against her, laws that made her illegal and nature (weather). In order for the airships to dock on the building, all aspects of the project had to be safe - but they weren't. "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (¶ @ NUM1). A German airship caught fire in New Jersey, and the owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad a fire could be in densely populated downtown New York City. Second, there was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas" (¶ @ NUM2), which would make it illegal even to attempt to approach the building. Finally, nature was not going to suddenly change and cooperate for a project and it was unpredictable when or if the weather would allow docking. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts ... The stern of the ship swiveled ... swayed above the pedestrians on the street" (¶ @ NUM3). Does it sound safe or practical ? Definitely not. In the end, all the obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced were too great to overcome, and the top of the building never became a mooring mast for airships.

The worker had to face many obstacles during the construction of the Empire State Building. Sence Al Smith was trying to compete with the Chrysler Building for the tallest building it kept adding to the Empire State Building. To make his building the tallest in the world, he added the mooring mast. This mast would make the Empire State Building 1,250 feet high. The builders had to rethink the entire skeleton of the buildings. They had to make sure the Empire State Building could support the pole. The mast was designed so that airships could land and people could get on and off. "The Empire State Building's steel frame should be altered and strengthened." The builders repaired the steel frame of the building in two months. Construction went as planned. After a while, people started to see that the mas could not be used for airships due to the strong wind currents at the top of the building.

When the builders were building the Empire State Building, they encountered many obstacles. One of the problems was the lack of a suitable landing zone in @ CAPS1 (paragraph 6). Al Smith had the idea of putting a mooring mast at the top of the building to allow airships to land on it, but this mooring mast had many problems. “Architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether, would add stress to the frame. of the building." (paragraph @ NUM1) the architects had to reinforce the foundations of the building. Over sixty thousand dollars have been spent trying to modify the framing of buildings. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." (paragraph @ NUM2) The winds were turning and the stern of the ship was pivoting, which was not certain. Another reason is that airships flew too low over urban areas. Having a mooring mast for airships on land was dangerous, against some laws and a lot of work.

In this excerpt, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building. The obstacles they face are the airship and the success of the mooring mast. The airships were huge balloons framed in steel, with envelopes of cotton cloth. filled with hydrogen and helium to make it lighter than air. unlike the balloon, an airship could be maneuvered using propellers and rudders. like a gandala. Another obstacle is the successful use of the mooring mast. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong draft. It could also weigh and hang over pedestrians was not safe. Overall, these are the obstacles they faced.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems they faced was that the airships moored to the top of the building added stress to the building frame, so the stress of the load of the airships would have to be transmitted to the foundation. Another issue they faced was that most airships outside of the United States used highly flammable hydrogen, so it would be very serious if any of them were destroyed by a fire over the center. - densely populated city of New York. In addition, there was already a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to even approach the area.

The obstacles the builder faced were @ CAPS1 avoidable. The first obstacle they encountered was the @ CAPS2 landing space they had. If they had thought about it a little longer, they probably would have found a way to overcome this problem. Now a @ CAPS3 some obstacles to talk about the fate of the mast. Everyone, including Al Smith, should have thought about safety, it should have been a top priority. The builder should have seen a problem like this coming, with a bad plan to build something @ CAPS4 has done before.

At first, all the plans for the Empire State Building seemed perfectly plausible. The airships moored to the mast at the top of the building and moored there as the passengers descended ; Easier said than done. Pretty soon they started to realize all the flaws in this plan, there was @ NUM1 principal @ NUM2.) After seeing how easily the "Hindenburg was destroyed by fire", they realized that it was too dangerous to fly airships over a "densely populated area". like downtown New @ NUM3.) When the Los Angeles Navy airship tried to dock, it "couldn't get close enough to dock because of the high winds." @ CAPS1 with the wind problem, if somehow an airship could be attached “the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast. ” @ CAPS2, unlike the landing fields of airships it was far too risky to hang weights over the city of @ CAPS3 just to keep the rear of the airships down. @ NUM1.) Contrary to what was previously thought, airships don't were not the way of the future, airplanes became the newest and most efficient means at the end of the 30's. A good idea, but as they say: "destined to never fulfill its purpose."

The @ CAPS1 of the @ ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles to try to allow airships to moor there. One of the problems was the law. There was a law in place preventing airships from flying too low over urban cities. This made it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even approach the area. Another problem they had was that the airships were filled with hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and it would be catastrophic if an airship exploded over New York City. The last problem they had @ ORGANIZATION1 was the wind. At the top of the building, the winds shifted due to strong air currents. Even if the airships were attached, the rear would move. They had the idea of using lead weights on the back, but it wouldn't be safe for all of these people.

The builders of the Empire State Building had the great idea to include a mooring mast where airships, also known as zeppelins or airships, could dock. While the idea is good, it provided builders with a lot of obstacles. For example, during the construction of the frame, it would be necessary to add the mast to the top. The mast could not simply be jettisoned, because if an airship was moored there, it would put too much pressure on the frame of the building. This revelation forced them to modify the whole frame to make it more solid, which was very expensive. Another difficulty encountered by the builder, once the construction was finished, to allow the airships to moor there, was nature. The building was 1,250 feet high, so the winds at the top were constantly changing and dangerous, making it difficult for the airship to stay still when docked. In addition, manufacturers had not planned for laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. These two challenges ended up making it impossible to use the mooring mast.       

<START>

 

One obstacle that the builders faced was that having airships suspended over a populated area was extremely dangerous, because on May 6, 1937, the German airship was destroyed by fire, another obstacle was that it It was illegal to have airships flying low over densely populated areas. . So Al Smith had to abandon this plan.

Trying to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building caused many problems for builders. The airships were too a thousand feet long which would make mooring realistically impossible as their size would add stress to the frame builders of buildings that would need to be rebuilt and the frame made stronger. Most non @ CAPS1 airships are filled with hydrogen, not Hellium, which is highly flammable if burning pedestrians could be seriously injured. Later uncover an existing low-flying airship law that would make it illegal for an airship to fly even near the Empire State Building

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow airships to dock there. What these builders were facing was a thousand foot deranged moored to the top of the building, the height of the Empire State Building is 1,250 feet. and strengthen the framework of buildings. Another problem that they didn't realize at first was the wind, strong drafts. With all of these issues that weren't easily resolved, the idea of an airship atop the Empire State Building was finally gone.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was the lack of suitable landing zones. It was believed that airships could anchor to the mooring mast for refueling or service, however, another obstacle was in the way ; nature. It was the biggest obstacle. The wind at the top of the building was still turning from the strong drafts. The builders were concerned that the stern of the ship would "pivot around and around the mooring mast." To be sure, they came to another hurdle. The whole building should be modified and reinforced with more than @ NUM1 dollars of investment. Finally, there was already a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. With all the obstacles encountered, it was never open to the public.       

<START>

 

The main problem encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to leave the airships docked was the wind conditions and the proximity of the airships to the building. The windy conditions made it difficult for the builders to understand how the airships would dock there. The winds near the top of the building were "constantly shifted due to strong drafts". (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) The other problem encountered by the builders was to know how far the airships approached the building. In one case, on a trial basis, the Los Angeles attempted to approach the mast but the mast "could not get close enough to tie up ...". Even though the building was not what it was supposed to be, it remains one of the tallest of all time.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock the airships. One of the first hurdles that builders encountered was realizing that the airship moored to the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame. The builder realized that the wind pressure could cause the airship to rotate, which would not be suitable for the foundation of the building. the strengthening of the building structure would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Workers also realize that airships are flammable and that if anything were to go wrong it would wreak havoc on such a populated area. These obstacles put an end to the dream of having a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.     

<START>

 

Throughout the excerpt, trying to build the Empire State Building; the builders faced many difficult attempts to build the airship dock. A major problem is that the airship was unable to land on the flat roofs of buildings. This was stated in paragraph @ NUM1 of the excerpt. Another problem is that they had to design elevators and stairs to get passengers to the top of the building so they could get on the airship. In addition to designing stairs, they had to be able to build 102 floors just for the area where the airship would land. This can be taken care of in paragraph 11 and @ NUM2 of the read. After trying to build the large building, the builders encountered major safety issues towards the end of construction. The builders didn't think they would run into any issues or think about safety.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of those obstacles was that " the stress of airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building ." This meant they would have to spend more @ MONEY1 to create a framework that could withstand this pressure. Another obstacle they faced was that most airships contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable. They were concerned that if the balloon caught fire, it would fall into the densely populated city below. And there was nothing they could do to change that. A third obstacle they faced was that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts." This meant that the airship was constantly moving as passengers tried to get on and off, which wouldn't be safe. These are some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced.

The expectations of the manufacturers were too high and they had to face many obstacles that they had not foreseen. Safety was a big issue to allow airships to dock there. The airships "used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." With a heavily populated city like New York City, it would have been easy to start a fire. Another obstacle to mooring airships was nature. The wind can sometimes be too strong. As the reading indicates, "the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts." These threatening winds would have prevented the airships from landing and serving as a safe means of transportation. The last hurdle was that it was illegal. The @ CAPS1 had been a law against this. The text indicates that "this law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel". With this law, there was not even a glimmer of hope that this plan could succeed.

The builders encountered many obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. They couldn't add an all-steel mooring mast to the top of the building, as that would add too much stress to the building's frame and foundation. If they wanted to add a mooring mast, they had to modify and strengthen the frame of the building. The other problem encountered by manufacturers was safety. They had to take into account that many airships from outside the United States used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. The building was in a densely populated area of downtown New York City. The last obstacle encountered by the builders was nature. The winds at the top of the building were very strong and the drafts moved frequently. This would have caused the airships to rotate around the mast.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. One obstacle was that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Since downtown New York is a densely populated area, that wouldn't be such a good idea. Another obstacle they had to face was the weather itself. The Empire State Building was very high so it was very windy. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. They also didn't think of the government when they were building the mooring mast. There was a law stating that airships could not fly low to urban areas. It would be illegal if a ship even tried to use the mooring mast.

The @ CAPS1 also faced the @ CAPS2 to get to the micheenery which was needed for @ CAPS4 the mooring mast.

The builders faced many obstacles in building a moor to moor airships. It was dangerous for an airship to be so close to the ground, especially in New York City. Air currents from above made the machine more difficult to operate near buildings. Another factor that contributed to the danger was that airships are highly flammable due to the hydrogen that kept them afloat at the time. Many airships attempted to dock with the Empire State Building, but none succeeded.    

<START>

 

The hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building overcame in attempting to allow airships to dock there were structural issues, breaking laws, and keeping the airship safe in the air. The structural problems this would have caused were the pressure placed on the foundations of the buildings by the airships. The builders were also breaking the law because there is a law saying how high an airship can fly over an urban area, airships would be way too low. The last hurdle for the builders was to keep the airship safe in the air. This is due to the strong winds that the airship would sway and could break. Another problem would be that if it exploded, the pieces would fall on downtown New York.

The architects designing the Empire State Building with the intention of mooring zeppelins at heights of over @ NUM1 feet undoubtedly had a lot to do. According to @ ORGANIZATION2's “The Mooring Mast,” obstacles included adding stresses to the framing of buildings with an airship attached, and designing the mooring mast itself. The article specifies that "the stress of the load of the airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the building" in order to secure the mooring. The mooring mast was made mostly of steel. Other problems encountered by the architects were the wind factor and keeping the zeppelins stationary in "heavy" and "constantly changing" air currents at @ NUM2 feet. Safety risks are also taken into account, as the architects realized that if another accident like the one in Hindenburg were to happen in New York City, the results could be disastrous. As such, the Empire State Building's mooring mast for zeppelins never entered service.

According to the clip " The Mooring Mast ", various obstacles were encountered in the challenge of mooring the airships to the top of the Empire State Building mooring mast. The first challenge that the builders faced was that of nature. "The biggest obstacle ... was nature itself." (@ NUM1) Strong winds that rise very high would cause the airship to sway unpredictably, making it dangerous. Another problem arose when the "Hindenburg" caught fire in New Jersey. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." (@ NUM2) If a hydrogen-filled airship catches fire at the Empire State Building, it could be very dangerous for the building and the pedestrians below. The last obstacle was a law. "... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." (@ NUM3) This law prohibited any plane from flying, even from a distance, near the Empire State Building. In the clip "The Mooring Mast", the builders encountered many obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock atop the Empire State Building.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems while constructing the airship dock. One is the winds and the safety of the building and the people. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts… using the Empire State Building was neither practical nor safe." Another hurdle that builders faced was that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. "This law would prevent the vessel from docking with the vessel or even approaching the area." There was also another problem. It was the structure of the building and the foundation. The builders made over sixty thousand dollars worth of structural modifications to build the mast.

Based on the clip, The Mooring Mast, the hurdles the Empire State Building builders faced in trying to get airships to dock was how could they have a thousand foot airship. moored to the top of the building, without "adding stress to the building frame." They couldn't just add the mooring mast above the flat roof of the Empire State Building, because "the load of the airship and the wind pressure would have been transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was close by. eleven thousand feet lower ". @ CAPS1 they had to find a solution, which was to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. Costing over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to the structure of the building. Also "rather than building a utility mast with any ornamentation, they built a tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel that would be illuminated from the inside," make the 101st floor an observation area. glass and from the floor @ NUM1 an open observation Platform.

Although the plans for the mooring mast are optimistic, there are many obstacles that have prevented this plan from becoming a reality. The number one reason manufacturers have difficulty allowing airships to dock was safety. The helium that filled the balloons was highly flammable. If one of them were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York. Second, the strong winds made it dangerous for airships. The paragraph @ NUM1 states : "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would constantly pivot ...". Finally, the manufacturers came up against the obstacle of pre-existing laws by trying to authorize the docking of airships on the mooring mast. An existing law stipulated that planes could not fly too low over urban areas. These three main obstacles were encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast never became a reality because of these obstacles.            

<START>

 

In the snippet, some of the obstacles they faced were that the building was the tallest in the world at 1,250 feet, as it says in paragraph @ NUM1. Another problem they encountered was that the airships weren't safe. The Hindenburg, an event where a helium-filled airship caught fire, occurred during construction. What if one of their airships catches fire over New York? The whole idea of airships was considered dangerous. Finally, there were laws saying that no plane could be this close to town. The very idea of the " future of travel " was very different and impractical.        

<START>

 

Obstacles encountered by the builders were weather conditions, the height of the structure, the stability of the structure, and concerns about the airship's highly flammable gases. Weather conditions affected the airship's dock because winds could spin it, throwing it against nearby buildings. The structure must be stable at its height so that the airship does not overturn the Empire State Building. Author Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1 declares: "The steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation", it was necessary so that the airship did not overthrow the Empire State Building, wiping out a lot of New York. Highly flammable gases would have to be under intense surveillance, because if they caught fire, the Empire State Building, pedestrians and downtown New York would catch fire. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used.

One of the big issues that mooring airships face is government and the law. It is illegal to have such an airplane flying at low altitude. He says: "... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area ..." ( @ CAPS1 @ NUM1). Another obstacle would be security. Airships are FLAMMABLE and could easily injure and kill people in an accident. Is too dangerous, "Most airships ... the hydrogen used ... hydrogen is highly flammable" (@ CAPS2. @ NUM2) Another problem is nature and weather. The winds up there are extremely high and mighty. Great danger to airships, "... strong drafts ... the stern of the ship would swivel ... well above pedestrians," (@ CAPS2. @ NUM3).

@ ORGANIZATION3 writes in his excerpt "The Mooring Mast" about the obstacles the Empire State Building builders faced while trying to create a dock for airships. By the end of 1929, Al Smith was confident of the height and use the building would achieve. Those working on the mooring mast project consulted with experts from the US Naval Air Station, but ultimately found the project too difficult to manage. The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the many problems they faced, the main one being nature itself. an airship at the high altitude from the top of the building turned out to be practically impossible. The project's danger to New York civilians was also a flaw due to the inability to keep an airship controlled by the wind and the vehicles' high flammability. Speaking there was another question regarding a law that would not allow an airship to fly at the altitude required to dock. The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting one and had n made airships perhaps became much more popular. However, the mooring mast was impractical and the obstacles it posed exceeded the ambition used to design it. "

The Empire State Building was high in the air, (@ NUM1 ft) the problems were with the building moving while it's in the air, and if you have something that weighs around fifty thousand pounds maybe more than the building could scam if there is a big windstorm. The dock seemed like a good idea, but you would need a winch and you had to put big clamps on the building to secure the balloon or airship to dock and refuel. In paragraph @ NUM2, @ PERSON1 from the architectural office of the building declared "The still unresolved problems of mooring the airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone the final installation of the train to a later date. landing. " If Irving ever decides to set up an airship and create an air station, then create some new technology.

The idea of using a mooring mast to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building has never been realistic. This is due to the many difficulties encountered when Al Smith's team attempted to create a mooring mast that would be used to moor the airships. these obstacles included ; the pressure that a moored airship would have on the building itself, the risk of strong winds causing the airship to shake violently, the risk of the airship catching fire due to the flammability of hydrogen if there is found, and the airship's close proximity would have to other buildings in the area The first problem encountered during the development of the mooring mast was the stress the heavy weight the airship would put on the building. "The steel frame of the [building] would have to be altered and reinforced to accommodate [the added pressure of the airship]." The weight of the airship wasn't the only thing that energized the building, so was the pressure of the wind. The wind made it difficult to create a mooring mast structure, as this would not only add pressure to the vessel as the airship itself could not stay in one place " Even if the airship was attached to the mast. mooring, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast. " An accident that could occur would be a fire due to possible flammability. And as the airship is so close to people, like tourists on the mooring. observation deck of the building, the blimp igniting (if filled with hydrogen instead of helium) could be more disastrous than if it landed in an open field.Finally, the airship is so close to the areas that it is illegal for such airships to moor or even fly in such close proximity. For example, when the Los Angeles tested the mooring process to the Empire State Building's mooring mast, it "could not get close enough to moor at cause of strong winds ". All of these were major obstacles in the process of building the Empire State Building and its mooring mast for mooring airships. These are also the reasons why the architects of the Empire State Building came to the conclusion that such a structure would not be practical to build.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast", by @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered very difficult obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of the most difficult obstacles was "nature itself". There were very strong winds which "moved constantly due to strong air currents". The stern of the airship would move endlessly even if it was " attached to the mooring mast ". In addition, airships typically landed on open airstrips and were weighted down with pellets. However, weighing airships with lead weights to a height of about 1,250 feet in such a densely populated area as New York City would be "neither practical nor safe." Finally, there was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas," which meant that the idea of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was simply unworkable.         

<START>

 

When designing the mooring mast for the Empire State Building, architects and builders faced many challenges. First, there were the basic issues of any transportation hub, how to move people and luggage around the terminal. Another more complicated problem was how the airship compensates for the additional stress on the building frame due to the load of the airship and the pressure of the wind. This issue was addressed by redesigning @ MONEY1 of the Empire State Building framework. In addition, more and more airships would constantly oscillate due to the strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. The weights could not be used to hold the airship in place as it would pose a danger to people in the streets below. The architects couldn't come up with a way to keep it in place. Eventually, the idea of a mooring mast for airships atop the Empire State Building was scrapped.       

<START>

 

While there have been high hopes for the attempt to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building, there have been many obstacles encountered in trying to achieve this dream. One obstacle noticed when designing the mast to dock on was that the height and weight of an airship would greatly increase the stress on the building's frame. This would then be passed on to the foundation of the building as well. This clearly had a bigger problem than the Empire State Building could resist. Another reason the builders faced an obstacle in the hopes of allowing the airships to dock was for safety reasons. One of the most apparent problems was that most of the airships outside of @ LOCATION2 were powered by hydrogen gas, as opposed to helium gas. This posed a threat because hydrogen is highly flammable. Endangering a densely populated area like downtown New York has therefore become an obstacle for builders. Nature itself came as one of the last problems for such a dream. The constantly shifting winds due to extreme drafts at the top of the building could easily spin the stern of the airship around the mooring mast. Again, putting thousands of people under the building was neither practical nor safe. moor airships on such a building.          

<START>

 

well, since that only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a landing pad for airships. So, Al Smith decided to add a mooring mast above the Empire State Building to allow these airships to anchor there to get gas for several hours and also service. And let the passengers get on and off there too. The airships were moored by an electric winch, which pulled in line from the bow of the ship and then attached to the mast. But, then again, the electric winch cable would cause stress to the building frame. The stress of the load of these airships and the pressure of the wind would be transmitted to the foundation of the building. The metal frame of the building should be reinforced or modified to adapt to this new situation.

The builders first talked about Al Smith in trying to make the Empire State Building the tallest building in the state, so it would be a great first plan for travelers, and they elevated it to @ NUM1 feet. But now the obstacle was for an airship to reach the top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith wanted the top of the Empire State Building to be a landing zone, where they could refuel for hours, or serve, and let passengers get on or off the airship. So that was one of the obstacles that manufacturers had to face, to make it work.

During the construction of the mast and the mooring to the Empire State Building, the builders faced major problems. The idea of an airship dock was a good idea at the time but encountered both structural and social problems. The architects and said that over time the dock for the airship and climate change will put stress on the building's framing. This has led to more reconstruction and economic spending. Another problem faced by builders was the location of the building itself. The newly built airships contained hydrogen rather than helium, which made them flammable. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire that made builders think about what would happen if it had taken place over a densely populated area like downtown New York. The mooring of the airships caused many obstacles which ultimately led to the project being terminated. What was thought of as the future is now the past.

According to the expert, the builders had to face many obstacles, ranging from the attempt to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the hurdles that builders faced was that the Empire State Building's steel frame had to be altered and reinforced to accommodate the situation. The builders also had a problem with the wind because "... the airship on the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area, which would pierce the hulls of airships.

In the reading comprehension "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock because they wanted to add the mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof and airships could carry the mooring mast to the top of the building. The architects found that if they placed the mooring mast on top of the building, the foundation of the building would be stressed.

The architects of the Empire State Building faced a tremendous amount of obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. Al Smith, the man who wanted to build the tallest building, said on December 11, 1929 that the Empire State would be 1,250 feet tall. It was decided that the building would have a mooring mast at the top to moor airships like airships. The airships, however, were very spacious. Some were up to a thousand feet long. A mooring mast therefore seems appropriate. This would allow airships / airships to dock there for refueling as well as allow passengers to get on and off. At present, the purpose of the mooring mast has never been achieved. The problems he faced were that most airships outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the German airship Hindenburg incident made the owners of the Empire S Building realize how bad it would be if it happened over such a densely populated area as New York. . The winds at the top of the building are constantly changing. An airship attached to the mooring mast would rotate the stern of the ship. Weights could not be added to weigh down the back as the airship would be right above the people walking the streets. Another practical reason was the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This law even prohibited the airship from approaching the building. In December 1930, the US Navy airship reached the mooring mast. However, he was unable to get close enough to tie the airship in place due to the high winds. The captain couldn't even let go of the controls for fear. At the end of the 1930s, the idea disappeared and was replaced by airplanes.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow the airships to be docked there. These obstacles included redesigning and changing the structure of the building, the dangers of a blimp catching on fire, swirling winds, and state law. “The architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building” (@ NUM1) This was because the building was not originally built to have this capacity. This meant that in order to do that, over sixty thousand dollars of modification had to be spent. Another obstacle encountered was the natural hazards of an airship. Airships have a probable chance of catching fire, as the Hindenburg shows. If this same accident were to happen in the densely populated area of New @ CAPS1, it would be a disaster. Another obstacle was that the winds above the building were still swirling rapidly. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast" (@ NUM2) It would just be dangerous to have something so big going around in circles. The last obstacle encountered by the manufacturers was that the plane of the law @ CAPS2 flying as low as the mooring mast. This would make it illegal to use the mooring mast. Probably should have been considered. Overall, poor planning has created a lot of obstacles for builders to dock the airships there.

Architects encountered obstacles during the construction of the Empire State Building. A NUM1 ft airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, which would add stress to the building frame. Architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The observation area was to serve as a boarding area for airship passengers. Once the building was framed, the roof had to be finished before the mooring mast frame could be made. The mast had a steel skeleton and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was built.      

<START>

 

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast excerpt, builders had to overcome obstacles to build the airship dock. The builders had to think about how the mast worked. He said in paragraph nine "Architects couldn't just drop a morning mast on the flat roof of @ ORGANIZATION1. A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building held by a single tether, would add stress to the frame of the building ". The builders had to modify the building. "As it says in paragraph ten" Rather than building a utility mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within, with a recessed design. which mimicked the overall shape of the building itself. »The obstacles that the builders overcame allowed them to use the mast effectively.

The architects of the Empire State Building encountered many problems while attempting to allow airships to dock theirs. One of the main causes was nature. Winds / drafts were a big risk. " Fearing that the wind would blow the airship at the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area, which would pierce the airships must ... " (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). It was a problem that no one could solve, no one could control the wind. Another big impact in the Mooring Mast peloton was the law. “The other practical reason why airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas” (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). This law would make full use of transport impossible. These obstacles that the architects could not overcome, and the original idea of the project was quickly forgotten.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered problems allowing airships to dock there. One of the problems was that they didn't really have a landing gear. It was very difficult to land an airship on the ground, but in the air it was almost impossible. Another reason was that it was very dangerous. The airship pilot should land it about @ NUM1 feet in the air and if they were wrong they could potentially die. Another reason was that there was a law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for people to land it up there. The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems when they tried to build a dock for airships.

There were many obstacles that workers faced when building the Empire State Building : making the tallest structure in the world, making it more useful than just a building, and most importantly, it had to be stable. and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the @ CAPS2 for architect Al Smith, his building had to be taller than the 1,046 foot tall Chrysler Building. The Chrysler Building was originally only @ NUM1 feet and the Empire State Building was expected to be @ NUM2 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed an arrow that was to be placed on top, the height of the Chrysler Building soared to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had started. When Al Smith was building a room to fit the top of the skyscraper he wanted to be "more than a spire or a dome or a pyramid put there to add a few desired feet" (paragraph @ NUM3), he wanted something that would really impress people. With the growing popularity of airships or airships, Smith decided to create a docking station for them atop his building. However, a lot of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much room for error and this luck didn't want to be taken with a crowded city of @ ORGANIZATION3 below. With the advice still added, place the Empire State Building 1250 feet, @ NUM4 feet higher than the Chrysler Building. The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 that the building seems to face were the elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very strong winds. Most of the building was weatherproof with the only issue being the top. It was designed to look almost like a rocket, with four wings at its base. Lined with steel, the structure still stands today. Most of the challenges faced by the team building this magnificent structure seemed impossible, but they created the building they intended to build. And he's still the tallest in the world to this day.              

<START>

 

The builders were confronted with three main @ CAPS1 : safety, nature and THE LAW. The first obstacle they faced was security. Many airships used hydrogen instead of helium. While helium is a @ CAPS2 gas, hydrogen is a @ CAPS3 which is combustible. The second obstacle they faced was nature. The @ CAPS4 winds blew the Blimps off target and because they weren't aero it was @ CAPS5 to maneuver them. The third hurdle was a law that said Blimps cannot fly too low, so if the other @ CAPS1 did not exist, that would still be illegal. In conclusion, they should have built a @ CAPS6 because @ CAPS7 are simply better than Blimps.

Some hurdles that builders encountered while constructing the Empire State Building's mooring mast were that the building was not stable enough to be able to moor an airship. They solved this problem easily by creating a stronger exoskeleton. Another obstacle they encountered was high speed winds and the ability to get passengers on and off. They never solved this problem and the mooring project was therefore stopped. The obstacles encountered by the builders were too numerous and this project quickly became impossible to complete and it never was.

In downtown New York City, Al Smith and his builders faced many obstacles to build and dock his airship to the top of the mooring mast which ultimately ended in failure. The reason he was planning to dock in New York was because that's where most of the passengers would be at the location, where Smith would see it would be a hit. Airships are made "with huge steel-framed balloons with cotton cloth envelopes filled with hydrogen and helium" (paragraph @ NUM1), in the days Smith didn't think, "l 'hydrogen is highly flammable' (paragraph @ NUM2) as the cotton fabric would also ignite; it is a dangerous hazard if an incident had occurred in a "densely populated area". Another obstacle they faced was that "airships could not over the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas" (paragraph @ NUM3) as it was illegal to 'Mooring the airships in low areas, that couldn't.' That doesn't happen for Smith, and the size of the airship is too long to not be able to crash into one of the other buildings. Not only that, but "the mooring mast could not come close enough to moor due to the high winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the airship on the sharp spiers of the building in the area" (paragraph @ NUM3) and it would be very likely to happen as there are a lot of buildings close to each other in New York. With all these issues they've been facing; lack; airships were not Al Smith's future transport, all of his plans failed in the end.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few hurdles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was the structure of the building. A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building held by a single tether cable. This would add stress to the structure of the building. The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure "should be transmitted to the foundation of the building," which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the empire state building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation.     

<START>

 

In the clip titled "The Mooring Mast" by @ ORGANIZATION1, there were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was nature. This is because the wind at the top of the Empire State was changing a lot due to the bad weather. The airship would move even if it was strapped in, the other challenge was safety. "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." This is not sure because if an airship caught fire in the building, 102 floors could burn. Also because downtown New York is a very densely populated place. These are the obstacles encountered by the Empire State Building in creating a mooring area for airships.       

<START>

 

The problem with the mooring mast on top of empire state buildings should have been foreseeable before it was built. The workers who built it were certainly against thick and thin when it was built. The top of the Empire State Building was in a constant weather crisis, " the winds were constantly moving because of the violent drafts ." This meant that an airship that attached to the mooring mast would sway in the wind. On land, airships have dead lead weights hanging over their backs so they don't swing, but it just wasn't practical to cling to the crowded city streets. In addition, the building could not support an airship without transferring its energy to the foundation. This meant that the whole building had to be reinforced to move the energy. It was also illegal for airships to fly this low over urban areas, and since most of the @ CAPS1 airships used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, the safety of the project was called into question. After the Hindenburg, people seemed more reluctant to support such a project, and even the owners of the Empire State Building realized how catastrophic an accident in a place like downtown New York could be. Overall, the theory of a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would remain a theory due to foreseeable obstacles.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the airships to dock. For someone, just letting a thousand foot airships land on top of a building was a huge hurdle. Having the airship on the building held in place by a cable tie was bad. The builder therefore had to work on the steel frame of the building so that the airship did not add as much stress to the building. It was a huge hurdle that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face.

Engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to face reality when a series of obstacles presented themselves as they tried to dock airships. The main problem was the usefulness of this dock creation. While this idea was innovative, it was impractical, as airships were never intended to be a popular source of transportation. The dysfunction in creating the idea was his goal. Indeed, the goal of this work was not to create a successful wharf, but to add images to the building. If the accent had been different, the result could have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose. Based on the laws, safety and practicality, it could not work. “Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen,” creating an extreme fire hazard in a densely populated area that would turn into a death trap. The airship's anchor only secures it at one point, allowing the airship to turn dangerously into the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disturb pedestrians. There was also an "existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas", making the project completely unworkable. Both attempts to reach the building failed, showing the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications were preventive. Overall, the builders were doomed in the face of the plethora of flaws in this project.

Builders encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles was finding a way to close the end of the airship without it blowing in the wind or endangering people. Another obstacle was laws prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. A final obstacle was the danger of hydrogen airships in general. These obstacles have proven to far outweigh the practicality of the mooring mast.

one of the obstacles they had to face was that they had to make it higher because it was supposed to be the tallest building. They also had issues with this so they had to keep fixing it.

There was a major problem with the airship mooring on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high in the air and downtown New York, where the Empire State Building is located, is a heavily populated area. If something is wrong, it will affect a large area because New York is a very urban area. It's a good idea, but Al Smith hasn't taken all the necessary precautions. Because if something goes wrong, a lot of things will go wrong because downtown New York is such a busy neighborhood. This is the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome by letting the airships dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. The number one barrier was security. The builders thought: How are we going to land an airship safely thousands of feet above the ground, while it is floating freely in the air? Plus, when you try this, you're high above the crowded streets of New York City. If there was any malfunction or error while docking, thousands of people could lose their lives. It is much easier to loan airships in the open field than in the open air, because you have a lot more space, you plant the airship on safe ground, and you can weigh it down so that it does not move. However, landing in the open field is dangerous because on @ DATE1 at @ LOCATION2, New Jersey, the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. This example shows that if this happened in the air above a crowded New York street or city block, many more casualties would have been recorded. These obstacles were real and these are some of the reasons the idea of landing an airship in the air slowly faded, because it wasn't the most logical idea.

The obstacles that builders face in attempting to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building are the law to fly also low towards buildings. They also face structural issues in the building to be able to hold an airship. They also couldn't stop the airships from moving in the wind. They faced safety concerns as some airships are filled with hydrogen and are highly flammable. They didn't want a fire in a densely populated area. They didn't want what was happening to the German airship Hindenburg in New Jersey to happen in downtown New York. The airship has never docked there and never will because it is dangerous.

The excerpt "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2 describes the creation of The Mooring Mast and its goal of extending the height of the Empire State Building. Although during the 1930s the concern of the Mooring Mast serving as a mooring area for drigibles, also known today as airships. After the construction of the 85th floor frame and the construction of the steel mast skeleton and stainless steel panes, problems with the landing carriages arose among the public. There were @ NUM1 main reasons why the Empire State Building mooring mast was never really completed. One of the reasons was security. The excerpt explains how airships from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. And, the use of hydrogen is extremely flammable. They used the example of the German Hindenburg Dirlie destroyed because it was on fire at @ LOCATION1. The second reason was the problem of wind currents. The winds were extremely strong. The airships would move and sway a lot because of the strong winds. And airships on the move being that they were at least @ DATE 2 feet long hung over urban areas, which was not at all safe for people walking below. areas was also a danger to the safety of people. It would be illegal for airships to be tied to a mooring mast over cities full of people who could run into people.

According to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. First, Al Smith, governor of New York for four terms, was determined to create the tallest building in the world; even taller than the Chrysler building being @ NUM1 feet tall. He also wanted the building to be aesthetic and nothing ordinary. His determination led him to the idea of the mooring mast, which in itself came with additional obstacles. "The stress of the load of airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." This meant that the framework had to be changed and strengthened. Other obstacles included the fact that the airships were highly flammable and could have caused a giant chaotic mess if they were over a densely populated area like downtown New York. In addition, "the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong air currents," meaning that even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would swivel all over the place, which didn't was "neither practical nor safe".

The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to let the airships dock there. The first hurdle that the builders encountered was the airship's ability to dock on the building due to the structure of the building. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the frame" (@ NUM1). The structure of the building had to be modified and reinforced for the project to function. The next problem was the use of hydrogen in airships, which is very flammable. Anyone under the airship while it was moored could be in danger if the airship were destroyed by fire. The biggest problem faced by the builders was the strong drafts. The stern of airships constantly pivoted when docked due to constantly changing winds. The mooring mast was not a sure idea that could never have worked.        

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building ran into obstacles in trying to allow the airships to dock theirs. The builders couldn't just let the airship land on the step of the Empire State Building. It would put a lot of pressure on the building. According to paragraph @ NUM1, it says "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single wire rope. 'fastener, would add stress to the structure of the building. " It would have cost sixty thousand dollars to modify the frame. Another obstacle they feared was that they noticed how much worse it would be if the airship caught fire on top of the Empire State Building. It would destroy part of the population as it would be in downtown New York. In paragraph @ NUM2, the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. He says that even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted in the back with lead weights, but using the state building, where they hang above pedestrians, was unsafe.         

<START>

 

One of the hurdles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow the airships to dock, was the change in structure and the additional cost and time in completing the building, the building was originally going to have a flat roof but in order to moor the airships they had to build a rocket-shaped mooring mast. The @ ORGANIZATION1 had to make visits to equipment and mooring operations. The safety of the passengers of the derigible was very important and a huge obstacle for the construction of the Empire State Building. Two floors would be reserved for passengers. Experts had to build a gate strong enough to carry people and combat the airships swaying in the high winds.    

<START>

 

When constructing the Empire State Building, builders had to think about the safety of allowing airships and their passengers to dock there. They must have been thinking of the winds at the top of the building. Wind currents change violently at the top of the building and because they could not weigh down the stern of the ship, the airship would spin around and around the mooring mast. They also had to think of airships from other countries. These airships used hydrogen which is more flammable than helium ships.    

<START>

 

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow the airships to moor there. The idea for the @ CAPS1 State Building mooring mast was neither practical nor secure. In paragraph fourteen, Marcia explains why this airship idea was not so secure. “The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts. In the last sentence of paragraph fourteen, the author indicates another reason why the idea was neither safe nor practical.“ They would be. hanging over pedestrians in the street. "

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems while trying to tie the airships to the mast. A major problem was that the original Empire State Building, "... couldn't just drop a mooring mast," on top of the building because "... the single cable tie, would add a stress to the building frame. The stress of airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building ... "More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the building frame. One of the reasons the airships were never moored on the mooring mast was due to " the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to a strong draft ". This makes it impossible even for airships to approach the mass without being impaled by other buildings. There was also "... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." It even made it illegal to dock airships atop the Empire State Building. Airships contain hydrogen which is " highly flammable ". If the Hindenburg incident had taken place in New York, the accident would have been "much worse". These reasons contributed to the builders' problems, and explain why the mooring mast was never used.            

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building were unable to build the mooring mast for the airships above the building because it is too high and the roof of the Empire State Building was too flat. The construction of the mooring mast requires a lot of effort because it has to take into account the wind pressure and keep the cable above the building. They design the floor @ NUM1 with glass to create an observation area and a boarding area for airship passengers. However, he has a lot of problems with the building. At the beginning the helium is flammable so it is too dangerous and the accident can be worse. They believe that the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast is nature, as the winds at the top of the building are constantly changing due to the strong draft.

The intended uses of buildings often face challenges. In the article "The Mooring @ CAPS1" by @ PERSON1, the obstacles encountered in allowing airships to dock at the Empire State Building are discussed. The first obstacle encountered is indicated in paragraph @ NUM1, when to build a quay above the building, the whole building should be reinforced. It was a hindrance as it would cost @ MONEY1. Another obstacle encountered was the weather. Above the building, violent drafts are raging. These currents would rotate the ship around and around the mooring. The last obstacle to mooring airships was the law. According to the article, "an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas ... would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building." The cost of building reinforcement, weather conditions, and laws were three hurdles encountered when docking airships to the Empire State Building.

The workers who built the Empire State Building encountered many problems when building a mooring mast for airships, two of which were that the winds at this height were unpredictable and foreign airships used airship. hydrogen instead of helium. “The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong drafts. Even though the airship was attached to the mast. mooring, the stern of the vessel would pivot around and around the mooring mast. " (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) This quote shows how dangerous it can be for airships to moor so high. Strong winds could cause the airship to loosen which could cause it to fly away, which is dangerous for pedestrians. Additionally, "most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2) This shows yet another safety hazard that workers have faced. If something were to go wrong, the airship could ignite and collapse on a large number of pedestrians. These are two reasons or issues that workers encounter when deciding whether it would not be safe or easy for airships to tie up to the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems when they came up with the idea of letting airships dock there. First of all, @ CAPS1 is a major concern, many airships were filled with hydrogen which is extremely explosive. Second, the winds at the top of the tower were very strong, making mooring terribly difficult, if not impossible. Well, it was illegal; in New York, there was a law prohibiting @ CAPS2 from flying at low altitude, and from docking to the building, it would fly in illegal airspace.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" from @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1, the obstacles the Empire State Building builders face in attempting to allow airships to dock there are in several ways. In my opinion, I think the Empire State Building is familiar to different people, but few know the purpose of serving as a landing point for airships. For an example " The main reason was safety : most states use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable ." In conclusion, it is in a sense how they faced the obstacles. In my opinion, transportation allows people to go from one place to another. For example, "By the @ DATE1, airships were being hailed as the transport of the future. The quote I just said means it allows passengers to move anywhere they want. In conclusion, these are two examples that describe obstacles and which allow airships to moor there.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the airship to dock with it were the lack of a suitable landing zone. In the snippet, they said that "the only obstacle was their increased use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing zone." Another obstacle was the climate as well as the wind pressure. For example, they said that " the stress of airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below ." The next hurdle is that of airships coming from outside the United States. German airships use hydrogen which is flammable. They said that "most airships outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. These are obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with. faced while attempting to allow the airship to dock.

According to @ ORGANIZATION2's " Mooring Mast " article , the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. @ ORGANIZATION2 states in paragraph @ NUM1, "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for obvious reasons before it was built." One of the reasons was security. Airships made outside of @ LOCATION1 contained hydrogen instead of helium, which is wrong because hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was because of the winds. They're constantly changing, they're fierce drafts, and they've moved the airship. The other reason and the most important reason is that airships cannot dock with the Empire State Building because it is illegal. There is a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas and it was illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach it. The builders had to overcome many obstacles.          

<START>

 

As in life, there are a lot of obstacles. When you are trying to create a new invention, it cannot be easy. So there were a lot of obstacles when building a docking area for airships on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the wind. People cannot control the wind or anything in the wind. So when it was really windy, the backs of airships would sway back and forth. When the Navy tried to dock the airships, they couldn't get it close to the mooring mast because the winds were strong. It is an obstacle to the construction of mooring areas. Another obstacle is security. Airships used gas instead of helium, so it was highly flammable. Also, they don't have much control over them. If the airship were to crash, it would kill a lot of pedestrians. If the Navy could fix these obstacles, the airship would be a good idea. They are difficult to repair but probably possible. The best idea is to get rid of it.           

<START>

 

The builders encountered many obstacles during the construction of the Empire State Building. They had to build it taller than any other building, but at the same time make sure it was stable. They also had to make the top of the building perfectly, otherwise the airships could not land. Eventually it was safe enough for airships to land and people to get off and circle the top of the building.   

<START>

 

In building the mast of the airships to be able to moor them, the architects neglected to see many flaws that were waiting to happen. First of all, it was illegal to fly an airplane this low on the ground. Most airships were primarily composed of hydrogen, which is highly flammable, so it would not be safe to fly over a densely populated area. The wind currents at the top of the building were also very strong, so the airship could be pushed to the side of a building and be punctured by a sharp object. In conclusion, the very idea of having airships landing on the Empire State Building was an accident waiting to happen.    

<START>

 

The architects of the Empire State Building faced too many challenges in trying to create a dock for airships. First, there was the issue of security. If a hydrogen-powered zeppelin caught fire over New York City, it would be disastrous. It could start a huge city fire. In addition, the wind was capricious up there and would make docking and docking extremely difficult. The Navy tried, but without success, because the wind did not even allow them to approach the mast. Third, there were laws preventing airships from flying too low over cities, which really ended the whole idea. The plan was dangerous from the start, even though it was really great.       

<START>

 

According to the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the derigibles to dock there are the stress of the load of the airship and the wind pressure should be transmitted. to the foundation of the building which was eleven hundred feet below. But the biggest obstacle was the wind, which was constantly changing, due to the strong air currents.

From the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ ORGANIZATION1 the builders faced obstacles to allow the airship to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle that builders have faced is the lack of a suitable rooftop landing pad. For this reasoning, they needed more space to moor the airship. They later had to put a steel needle on top of the Empire State Building so the balloons could dock and let people out. The next hurdle they faced was that “outside of the United States they were using hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. obstacle is that it was illegal for airships flying too low over urban areas as it can come to rest and strong winds will blow it in different directions. For this reasoning, the winds could force the balloon to go into different directions and hit another building if the winds are strong, these are obstacles that the builders faced in the excerpt "Le Mât d'Amarrage" from @ ORGANIZATION1.    

<START>

 

The success of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was hampered by many obstacles. Safety was one of the main reasons because "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen was flammable." @ CAPS1 from a densely populated city like New York could hurt a lot of people. Nature also turned out to be a hindrance as "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts." This would cause the airship to "rotate around and around the mooring mast" which was neither practical nor safe. It would also be difficult to control the airship once it is attached to the mast due to the violent movement the airship is in. There was also a law "against airships flying too low over urban areas". This law prohibited any airship from approaching or attaching to the mooring mast. All of these obstacles were encountered by the builders of the mooring mast, which ultimately led to the idea of using the mooring mast for ships being ignored.       

<START>

 

According to the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were wasted. They spent extra money to restructure things, but it wasn't necessary. Even though they found a way to dock the airships, it was already illegal for planes to fly so close to cities.  

<START>

 

While the idea of allowing airships to dock at the Empire State Building was seriously considered, the safety and reality were an unrealistic feat. In order for the mooring mast to successfully hold an airship, more than @ MONEY1 of modifications had to be made to the framing of the building. Always @ CAPS1 embarrassed, the biggest being security. Most of the airships outside @ LOCATION2 used hydrogen gas rather than helium, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how serious an airship fire would be, and even more so if it happened over the densely populated city of New York. The wind was also a serious factor that dismantled the idea. If the airship were to be strapped to the mast, the swaying stern of the ship and lead weights were out of the question. Lead blocks suspended above pedestrians on the streets of New York City was neither a practical nor a safe idea. An additional hurdle was the existing law that did not allow airships to fly low or too close to urban areas. Even if this were attempted, the ships would have difficulty mooring due to the high winds. These @ CAPS1 have all been encountered while attempting to allow airships to tie up to the building, an idea that is no longer being considered.          

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered a few hurdles when trying to allow airships to dock there, such as security, weather, and politics. One of the most obvious issues was the security of the mooring. Airships run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If anything happened while refueling the airship, it could potentially cause extreme damage to the densely populated area below. Another factor of shortness of breath was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing direction because of the "strong drafts" so high. Additionally, it turned out to be difficult to tie up the airship as the winds were so strong that the airship could not get close enough to the building. A final hurdle that was apparent was the law that was enacted stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the docking dock illegal if it was used and made airship captains aware that being so low and so close to many buildings makes docking airships difficult and dangerous.

In the clip The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, we learn about the many obstacles that stand in the way of landing an airship on top of the Empire State Building. One obstacle can be found in the paragraph @ NUM1 which says : "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." As you can see, the use of hydrogen would pose a great danger to New York City as an airship was landing on top of the building. It is a very crowded place and could be potentially very dangerous. Another example of an obstacle can be seen in paragraph @ NUM2. He said that "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". @ CAPS1 in the wind. Lüsted informs us of the terrible danger of drafts at the top of the Empire State Building. Overall, there were many obstacles in the way for the airships to dock, and that is ultimately why it was not successful.

The Empire State Building was supposed to be awesome The tallest building in the world. Although they achieved their height goal, the real building goal was never used. The building was supposed to serve as a waiting dock for these new air ships called airships. However, this was not the case. There were reasons that were apparent before it was ever built. One of the biggest obstacles was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were too strong for the airship to be safe. The stern of the ship swiveled around the mooring mast, and trying to weigh it down with bricks was impractical. Another problem that was encountered was the law which would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the building or even approach the area. But two ships tried to land. The US Navy Los Angeles airship failed to land because it was too dangerous. In the end, the Empire State Building never served as a station for airships.        

<START>

 

In the clip The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. These obstacles included the added stress on the building frame. The excerpt states in paragraph nine "A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable would add stress to the framing of the building." This obstacle could cause the entire structure of the building to collapse, which could cause death and a lot of destruction. Another obstacle was nature. The excerpt states in paragraph fourteen " The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts." " These violent air currents could lose control of airships and hit the building and the other buildings that surround it. The added stress to the Empire State Building and nature itself were the two main obstacles for builders.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to land airships there. One of these obstacles was to "modify the existing plans for the protection of the building". Another thing was nature, the winds wouldn't let an airship land there. But the main reason was safety: "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."

In the excerpt " The Mooring Mast " by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was in paragraph 6, according to the excerpt, "one of the obstacles to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone". This meant that the architects had to build enough area to land the airships, with precision and care. Another obstacle appeared in paragraph @ NUM1, which said that "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". This explains that the outcome of nature can be predicted, but it cannot be controlled. The amount of "strong drafts" can disrupt the landing of airships and it is "neither practical nor safe" for airships to hang over pedestrians on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building failed. There was a law stated in paragraph @ NUM2, which made it "illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even to approach the area". Instead of using the mooring mast, airships gave way to planes.          

<START>

 

Airship builders had to face many obstacles to allow them to moor. One obstacle was that it was illegal for "airships to fly too low" over urban areas. It was illegal for him to "attach himself to the building". The purpose of airships was to be able to tie up to the mast. If it couldn't fly up to the mast and dock, the mast or airships were of no use. If they were to be able to dock, they would have to be ballasted with lead weights. The problem with the weights was that they were hanging over pedestrians. It was "neither convenient nor safe" for pedestrians on the street. If the airship docked at the top of the building, they would be held together by a single cable. All the pressure exerted on the cable would stress the building frame. If that were to happen, then they would have to strengthen and modify the foundations of the buildings. Overall, the biggest hurdle they faced was not thinking about their airship plan. If they had thought it through these obstacles, they could have been avoided.           

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to secure the land. Many foreign airships used hydrogen instead of helium to maintain their float. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and has proven to be. On @ DATE1, a German Hindenburg airship was destroyed in a hydrogen fire in New Jersey. When the owners of the Empire State Building realized the seriousness of this event, they were turned off. Nature was the biggest obstacle of all. Since the building was so high, "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong wind currents." The law was rather large to pass, and there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. It would therefore be illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even approach the area.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. A few of these issues included the design of the mast and ensuring that it was secure enough for the airship to dock on. According to the excerpt, "The steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation." This meant that the builders had to modify the construction plan of the building to be able to contain the airships. After constructing a new layout for the building, the security conflict kicked in. Stated in paragraph @ NUM1, "The main reason was security : most airships coming from outside the United States used air. hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. " Another big security issue was "nature itself". "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." The drafts meant that they had to stow the airship, but even then it is dangerous as it would swing over pedestrians on the street. Both the design and the safety of the building were big hurdles that builders faced when trying to allow airships to dock there.

When the builders of the Empire State Building were constructing the mooring mast for the airships, they encountered obstacles that could have jeopardized the project. There were two aspects that builders needed to pay special attention to, structural integrity and design. Since " architects could not just lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the building, " builders had to modify the building's frame. These changes cost more than @ MONEY1. The other aspect that posed a barrier was the design. The architect, John Tauranac, described the plan to make the mast "more than ornamental" and "more than something as mundane as a water tank. Thus, to meet the architect's lofty aspirations , the builders constructed a "shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within. It took a lot of extra work from the builders. Despite the obstacles, the boilers did the job.

In the clip, The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle being that the architects could not have a mooring mast at the top of the building because the airship would be, "... held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). This would weaken the structure of the building due to the load of the airship, as well as the pressure of the wind. Then the stress would be transmitted to the foundation of the building. As a result, the building's framing was changed, costing "over sixty thousand dollars" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). Another obstacle was the design of the mooring mast, so that passengers could be brought "... up to the eighty-sixth floor, where the baggage and ticket areas would be" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM3) . In order for this to be completed, the builders had to complete the roof. Finally, “The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself” (@ CAPS1 @ NUM4). When the winds kicked in at the top of the building, the airship swiveled around the mast. This would endanger the safety of pedestrians on the street. The mooring mast supported many reasons for the obstacles that builders faced in attempting to allow the airship to dock with the Empire State Building.

In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, from @ PERSON1, the author describes the many obstacles that builders face in allowing airships to dock. The first problem was the modifications that had to be made to the framework of the buildings. “Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made,” showing how expensive this product was going to be. A second potential problem was that " the winds above the building were constantly changing ". This could lead to many different complications. One of them would be how "the wind would blow the airship on sharp arrows", a consequence feared by the Los Angeles ice ax. Another problem raised by the changing winds would be the ship's spin, which could lead to disaster. They arranged for use with impractical things, ultimately leading to the drop of the mooring mast.

In the snippet, the builders and architects who built the Empire State Building had many problems trying to build the pole on top of the building. One of the reasons was that they built it before they even considered the problems it could cause. The biggest problem was safety: "the hydrogen used in airships was highly flammable". Another problem was the wind: “They could never use the mooring mast because of the strong winds moving at that height. If the airship were ever attached to the vessel, "its aft end would pivot around and around the mooring mast." Carts moored in the fields could be held in place with lead weights, but using those feet NUM1 feet above downtown New York City wouldn't be safe at all. The latest issue was a law banning airships flying so low over cities and pedestrians. So, needless to say it wouldn't work.

The obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building were numerous. Architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building which was only held by a single tether cable. This would add stress to the frame of the buildings. In order to support the load of the airship, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and reinforced, which was worth more than sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building were always changing, which could cause the stern of the ship to rotate around and around the mooring mast.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles the architects faced was the strain that the tether cable would place on the foundation of the building. In paragraph @ NUM1, Lüsted mentions: “ The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. " A very expensive problem to solve. Another challenge that builders faced when attempting to allow airships to dock was the lack of security. Airships coming from outside the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. In paragraph @ NUM2, Lüsted says: “The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much [an] accident could [have been] if it had taken place over a densely populated area like the center. - New York City. The number 1 obstacle encountered by builders was nature itself. The strong winds at the top of the building were constantly moving. In paragraph @ NUM3 reasons Lüsted. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." It would not be practical or safe. The obstacles encountered by the builders were enormous, so the idea had quietly disappeared

From "The Mooring Mast" by @ ORGANIZATION2, he describes many of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building are attempting to allow airships to dock. The vessel's mooring mast was never intended to serve its purpose. An example is most airships from outside the United States that used hydrogen. The United States mainly used helium, which is not flammable like hydrogen. Fortunately, the owners of the Empire State Building understood that there could have been a terrible accident if hydrogen airships had been used in the Empire State Building. Another obstacle for builders was nature. the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. This made him unsafe for pedestrians downstairs. these are the obstacles that the builders encountered when they attempted to allow airships to dock.

Marcia @ CAPS1's article "The Mooring Mast" explains the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock. No one realized that the building would not be strong enough to allow a thousand foot airship to be docked there. This pressure, and the pressure of the wind, would be "transmitted to the foundations of the building". The steel frame would also need to be reinforced, which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Several other issues arose due to pedestrian safety concerns: Most foreign airships used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Everyone involved in the project realized that if the hydrogen caused a fire, the many people living in downtown New York could lose their lives @ CAPS2, the airship would swing 1250 feet above @ CAPS3 crowded, endangering countless pedestrians. @ CAPS2 there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made it "illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area". Although the Empire State Building never served its purpose, it is an international landmark in the heart of New York City.

In their attempts to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building, the builders encountered obstacles that ultimately prevented the idea from moving forward. "The winds at the top of the building were moving constantly due to strong air currents" (line NUM1 @ NUM2) Due to the changing winds at the top of the building, there would be no safe way to moor an airship, more light as air, on top of a tall building. Another problem was the wind, too, as if the captain let go of the controls, the airship could throw itself on top of another sharp spare, making other tall buildings an obstacle. The law of the day also became an obstacle "an existing law against airships flying low over urban areas" (@ NUM3 line 1) the building itself was tall but even at the top it was not legal for an airship to moor due to the highest restrictions. These attempts to build a mooring dock above the Empire State Building would have sent New York City an upward twist to be in terrestrial innovation, but the hurdles were too great to overcome.    

<START>

 

There were big obstacles for the airships to land and dock on the Empire State Building. At first the idea was great and moved people's minds, but when the mast was built people realized that it wouldn't work. The first issue for the airship, the law for airships to be so low over urban areas, making it illegal for the ship to be that close. paragraph @ NUM1) "which means that it would be very dangerous for passengers to get on and off the airship. The last problem is that foreign airships use hydrogen which is flammable and place it on top of a Densely populated area could cause horrible damage.These precautions had to be taken which were obstacles for the Empire State Building.    

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced three main challenges in trying to make the mooring mast accessible to derigibles. Most of the foreign derigibles still used hydrogen; a highly flammable gas. A fire in the streets of New York would be disastrous. There were also fierce and changing wind currents above the building. These winds would rotate the stern of the airship around and around the mooring mast. @ CAPS1, there was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law prohibited airships from attaching themselves to the building or even approaching it. These three factors made the mooring mast "neither practical nor safe".

Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle they faced was passenger safety when the airships docked and the building's frame did not collapse. I know because between paragraphs NUM1 @ and @ NUM2, extract said : " A group of engineers here in New York and try to find an arrangement practical and achievable and government people in Washington are seeking a way safe to tie airships to that mast. '"The mast weighs a lot, so they were concerned that it would put too much pressure on the Empire State Building. Engineers were also concerned that the airships would explode because the airships use air. hydrogen. Hydrogen is much more flammable than helium. I know that because between paragraphs @ NUM3 and @ NUM4 it says : "Most airships coming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. These are some of the many obstacles that workers have faced

In this clip, the architect / workers faced several obstacles while trying to build a docking area on the Empire State Building for airships. They had to find a way for this huge mast not to kill the frame of the building. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's frame. the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. to face the facts that this was impossible to do or not allowed. “Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on 6 May 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area like downtown New York.

In attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. Airships are steel-framed balloons, with envelopes or cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Airships could be maneuvered using propellers and rods, and passengers could climb into the pod, under the balloon. The load stress of the airships and the pressure of the wind had to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. more than @ MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the frame of the buildings. Also the law prohibiting airships flying at low altitude over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel.      

<START>

 

The obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were that they had to allow airships to dock there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers get on or off. The airships were moored using an electric winch, which hoisted a line from the bow of the ship, then tied it to a mast. The bodies of airships could sway in the breeze, yet passengers could safely get on and off the airship by descending a gangway to an open observation deck. They had to go through all these obstacles to build the Empire State Building.

Al Smith, a former governor of New York, paved the way for the construction of the Empire State Building. This building was being constructed to be the tallest building, taller than the Chrysler building which was @ NUM1 feet tall. In order to make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler Building, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast at the top to moor the airships. This idea encountered many obstacles. First, the passage indicates that " the steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation ". It would cost a lot of money to build. Additionally, "most airships outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." @ CAPS1, the passage states that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts." The builders realized many problems after the construction of the mooring mast. The builders should have thought of each situation before building the mast which cost a lot of money. Although the mast was no longer in use, the Empire State Building still stood at a height of @ NUM2 feet, the tallest building ever built.            

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building never achieved their goal. They hadn't predicted the potential problems they would face. First of all, they couldn't attempt to land the airship on the mooring mast as that would be dangerous. Indeed, "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (paragraph @ NUM1). They realized the complications that would entail if there were to be an incident like the one in New Jersey. Also, nature was an obstacle to the project; "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts" (paragraph @ NUM2). Therefore, due to the winds, the stern of the airship would swing around the mooring mast, posing a huge danger to the streets. Finally, airships could not dock with the Empire State Building because there was a pre-existing law regarding how low airships could fly over urban areas.        

<START>

 

The architects didn't realize how many potential problems the mooring mast would bring until it broke down. The main reason the airships couldn't land was purely safety complications. Many airships at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Another main reason was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were very strong and could easily push an airship in the wrong direction. Before these problems, there was already a law prohibiting the flight of airships that were too low over urban areas. Airships couldn't dock at the Empire State Building because it was dangerous and illegal.      

<START>

 

In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had many hurdles to deal with. They had to make sure that the airships went high enough and were secure so that the passengers could get on and off safely. The builders had to deal with a lot of things. "The architects couldn't just put a mooring mast on the roof of @ ORGANIZATION1." Due to the height of the buildings, they were unable to operate things. The airship was too heavy and it added stress to the frame of the building, to unload things it was too difficult for the ground it had to be on to be too low. it is desirable to postpone the Final final installation of the landing gear to a later date. " The project was so difficult that they had to abandon the task and develop at another time. The workers were devastated.      

<START>

 

There were a lot of problems to overcome in the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The first problem to overcome was the stress that a thousand foot long airship would add to the framing of buildings. This was resolved by spending more than @ MONEY1 to modify the framing of the building. Another problem was a law prohibiting airships flying too low around urban environments, discussed in paragraph @ NUM1. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." @ CAPS1 written on the wind. At 1,250 feet high, the wind is strong and would spin an airship too far to be sure, and the ends could not be weighed down for fear of injuring a pedestrian. These are three important reasons why the mooring mast failed.       

<START>

 

In trying to let the airships dock with the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many problems. The first problem was the fact that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. The problem with hydrogen is that it is highly flammable and there would be a huge risk in having a hydrogen blimp over a city full of pedestrians because it could catch fire and injure them. . Second, the victories at the height of the Empire State Building were always on the move, posing great risk to the pilots. If their airship were to deviate from its path, it could collide with other high-rise buildings in the city. The US Navy Los Angeles airship was blown away by high winds and the pilot could not let go of the controls for fear of hitting other buildings. Finally, there was a pre-existing law that would have made an airship illegal. have entered the airspace around the Empire State Building.    

<START>

 

This is @ CAPS1 as a very difficult test for them as they are trying to create an era of transportation with the thoughts of the pioneers. But once, the architects designed the mooring mast and made changes to the skeleton of the building. They built the 85th floor, the roof of which had to be completed before the frame.  

<START>

 

In 1929, when Al Smith announced that he was going to build a docking port for airships atop the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles in the way of the architects' building design. Building an airship dock atop the tallest building in the world is no easy task. They should have realized before the project that this was a lost cause, but they tried it anyway. The architects of the project had to design a plan that would reinforce the main beams of the building while being able to control the movements of the rear of the airships due to uncontrollable wind conditions. Unfortunately, they never found a way to complete this task and because of it, the Empire State Building was never able to dock the airships.   

<START>

 

In the 1930s, that would have been a difficult obstacle to overcome. the idea altogether has been questioned by many people. the first @ CAPS1 compared in height with the chrysler building. and the mooring mast worked in theory but actually had many problems. It was a potentially dangerous attempt.    

<START>

 

When the Empire State Building was built, it ran into a lot of problems while trying to dock airships to it. One problem they encountered was that most overseas airships were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The builders didn't want to recreate the Hindenburg crash in a densely populated area like New York. The biggest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents at the top of the building were violent and ever changing. Docking an airship in these conditions would cause it to rotate around the building and become unsafe for passengers. This is why the mooring mast never fulfilled its function.      

<START>

 

The construction of the mooring mast above the Empire State Building was very poorly thought out. This is the reason why they faced so many obstacles. From the start, Al Smith never thought about the safety of people. “When other countries used hydrogen instead of helium it was a cause of very flammable possibilities. If that happened in New Jersey, how bad would it be in a densely populated place like New York City. I could never imagine walking down the street and driving with weight falling on my head. In New York, there were strong drafts and when the airships were attached they swayed. The idea was to hold them in place with lead weights. This was neither practical nor safe. The only thing that should have been thought about before it was built was the law. It was illegal for an airship to fly low overhead. urban areas or even docking with buildings.In conclusion, everything should have been thought through before hype about something that wasn't safe, and that was illegal.   

<START>

 

Reading the passage "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it is easy to see the many complications of landing an airship on top of a 1,250 foot building. On the one hand, there is the natural effect of the wind. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." @ CAPS1 winds would make it difficult to land a plane floating anywhere if the back could not be ballasted. Another hurdle that builders faced was that the frame had to be sturdy enough to hold an airship @ NUM1ft long. "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." The workers then had to spend more @ MONEY1 to remodel the framework of the Empire State Building. Another problem is that anchoring airships would be illegal. According to "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas". All of these security concerns and violations would make “docking” impossible.         

<START>

 

The architects and builders faced some big problems while building the mooring platform, even though they didn't notice them at first. The builders did not notice any significant problems until the Hindenburg airship crashed at Lakehurst. The owners of the building became very concerned for the safety of people inside and below the building if an airship fell in the same situation as the Hindenburg.  

<START>

 

When Al Smith first proposed the plan to use the Empire State Building as a mooring mast, he had no idea what obstacles they would face in attempting to allow airships to dock there. A big obstacle was security. "Most airships outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) The reason it's so dangerous is that if the gas inside caught fire, the entire craft would explode into flames. It is a danger to those on board the ship, as well as to those in the streets below. Another obstacle was the strong winds at the top of the building. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2) It was a problem because the airship would move in all directions. The idea of using lead weights to weigh them down has been proposed, but they would pose a hazard to pedestrians below. A third and final hurdle they faced was the stress that an airship would place on the building's framing. The building design was not able to withstand the stress of an airship strapped to its mast, without changing the design the airship would likely tear the building apart. The only solution was to reinforce the building " More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the framework of the buildings " (@ CAPS1 @ NUM3). It's a ridiculous amount of money they must have spent just to get the airship to dock. It's easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders faced.               

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building had to face fewer obstacles than difficult ones. one of the obstacles was the crowded @ CAPS1 they had for the airship. crowded @ CAPS1 may cause the airship to hit or hit another building if it doesn't blow the thing up. The wind could also cause the airship to sway and hit another building. Another obstacle was the stress on the vessel because the airship was attached to it. If the wind was blowing hard, the airship would put a lot of strain on the building and something could go wrong.     

<START>

 

While trying to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. The first hurdle they faced was that docking such heavy airships would add stress to the vessel. Indeed, "the load of the airship and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundations of the building". Another obstacle they endured was the fact that the hydrogen gas used in the airship was highly flammable. As severe as the Hindenburg explosion was, it could have been much worse, "if it had taken place over a densely populated area like downtown New York." It was also very dangerous for airships to fly so low over an urban area. Finally, the strong winds would make mooring difficult. Winds that rise very high on a building are " constant due to strong drafts ." The workers obviously had a lot of trouble building the mast and it just couldn't be finished.          

<START>

 

From the excerpt "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles. By trying to allow airships to moor there. One of the obstacles faced by manufacturers was the number of airships flying too low over urban areas. The law would make it illegal for a vessel to dock with the vessel or approach the area. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the high winds. "The US Navy Los Angeles airship approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to moor due to the high winds." The biggest obstacle was that the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong air currents. The stern of the vessel would pivot around and around the mooring mast. The final hurdle was that the airship wasn't sure it was hanging over pedestrians.        

<START>

 

In @ ORGANIZATION1's The Mooring Mast excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. For example, a big problem they face is the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the flat roof of the empire state building. “This operation would not be possible because” Thousand foot airships moored to the top of the building held by a single cable tie, would add stress to the building foundation, which lies nearly 11 hundred feet below. “The Empire State Building's steel frame would need to be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new foundation. One big obstacle they faced was a big Safety Issue.” Most of the airships outside @ CAPS1 were using drogen @ CAPS2 rather than lium @ CAPS3, and drogen @ CAPS2 is highly flammable. the biggest obstacle to face was nature itself. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. . Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted at the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, if they were hung on top of padestrans in the street was neither practical or safe. These are the obstacles that stat empire building faced.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Some obstacles were the lack of a suitable landing zone. Another obstacle was that they couldn't just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the building, a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building. frame of the building. Also, if they wanted to do that, it would have to go down to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet down. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. To reduce this, airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted with lead weights, but the barrier to this is having weights suspended over pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. All these obstacles, yet these people were still able to build the Empire State Building with a mooring mast.       

<START>

 

In the clip, "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. As stated in paragraph 1 of the excerpt, the Empire State Building was to be the tallest building in the world in @ DATE2. The architect of the Chrysler building constructed the building to be 46 feet taller than the Empire State Building. Governor of New York, Al Smith did not want to lose the title of the tallest building. In paragraph 6, he tells you about Smith's idea: A mooring mast was added to the top of the building that would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. And let the passengers get on and off. Security concerns did not allow the Empire State Building's mooring mast to fill its person, @ NUM1 said in paragraph. Most airships outside of @ PERSON2 used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. Due to the sharp buildings, it was extremely dangerous. As indicated in paragraph @ NUM2 ; the biggest obstacle was nature. At the top of the Empire State Building, the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong air currents. Also, the law of flying too low. At the end of the 1930s, the mooring mast plan disappeared.              

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced several hurdles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. First, there was the problem of having a large airship moored to the top of the building using a single tether cable that would add stress to the building's frame, right down to its foundation. To solve this problem, the framework of the Empire State Building would have to be reinforced. Another issue was the safety of citizens on the streets below. Airships using hydrogen could ignite. In addition, the strong winds would make it difficult to moor the airship to the mooring mast. The airship could not be weighed down as the weights were hanging over pedestrians in the streets. The effectiveness of these winds was demonstrated when the US Navy airship Los Angeles attempted to dock. During this attempt the winds were very strong and the captain of the airship feared that it would be pierced by other vessels with sharp arrows. These are several examples of what the builders of the Empire State Building had to contend with.                          

<START>

 

Some obstacles that builders faced were too much stress on the framing of buildings. It should transmit all the weight and pressure to the foundation of the building. Also, there would only be one cable that would hold it in place. The cable was called a tether. Another obstacle would be an existing law saying that you cannot moor your ship there because you are flying too low. In December 1930, the airship @ ORGANIZATION1 tried to park there, but they were concerned that the wind would throw it into another building. That's why they threw up some tough hurdles, but in the end, they fixed it and made it happen.      

<START>

 

Derigibles, called airships in a modern way, were widely regarded in @ DATE1 as the last and greatest form of transportation there is. These carts required rapid means of refueling and unloading passengers both efficiently and safely. Just as these derigibles became popular, modern skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building dominated the New York skyline. Al Smith, a former New York governor who was leading the Empire State Building construction efforts, came up with the idea of building a mooring mast on top of his building that would help airships dock, refuel, and unload the cargo quickly and efficiently. Although at the time this idea was seen as both " practical " and " achievable, " it was never used due to safety concerns later discovered by the architects. These safety concerns included fear of " constant shifting " winds "due to strong drafts " as well as airspace restricting laws that prohibited "airships from flying too low over urban areas." Although this idea seemed revolutionary at the time, there were many obstacles in its way to glory.              

<START>

 

The obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were extremely difficult to overcome. the building with the wind pulling it and swaying back and forth as the wind direction changes. Also, it's too low for an airship to fly because of other buildings. Most importantly, the gases inside the airship are flammable and would be a diversion for New Yorkers.

Diregible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @ LOCATION1 on @ DATE1 The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area, such as the center - city New York in Mooring MAST Airships had a maximum speed of eighty miles an hour and they could navigate to seventy miles an hour over thousands of miles without having to refuel, some were as long as four blocks in New York City.

In @ DATE1, Al Smith hoped to build the world's largest airship pier in New York City. However, during construction, the Empire State Building's docking system encountered many problems. One obstacle was the strong winds over New York. In paragraph @ NUM1, the author says, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts." These victories caused the tails of airships to shift when moored, causing dangerous landings and takeoffs. Another obstacle encountered was a law that prohibited airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. This was feared because of the Hindenburg accident in 1937. Building officials feared that if this accident happened in New York City, the damage would have been catastrophic. The final hurdle faced by the Empire State Building's docking system was that many overseas airships used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and had an accident occurred over New York City, the damage would have devastated the city and caused a huge number of casualties.

Based on "The Mooring Mast" written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow the airships to dock there. Built in the 1930s, the Empire State Building was originally built to exceed the height of the Chrysler Building; it was going to be 1,250 feet tall. What added to the height of this building was its large mooring mast which stood at the top of the building. Airships, very similar to balloons, were gaining popularity in the aviation world. However, there were many issues that hindered the progress of this project. Most of these issues were security issues. One of the practical reasons airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was a law in effect banning airships flying too low into urban areas. Another reason was the flammability of these vessels. Most of them ran on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if the ship were to explode, scores of civilians and passengers would be killed. In summary, due to security risks, the Empire State Building mast could not and never was used for its original purpose.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles. "... the lack of a suitable landing pad." (@ CAPS1 6). This meant that it was difficult to land the airships. Another problem they faced was nature. Wind and weather could make landing airships very dangerous. "The airships were moored with an electric winch, which called in line from the bow of the ship and attached it to the mast." (@ CAPS1 6). This means that if the wind is blowing in the wrong direction or competing with the electric winch, it would be difficult and dangerous to land with the airship. Another obstacle was the expense. "Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). It means they had to pay a lot of money which is easy. It was definitely an obstacle they had to face.             

<START>

 

The builders of @ ORGANIZATION1 thought they had a great idea and were trailblazers. They quickly realized that there were problems with their ideas. A major issue was security. As stated in paragraph @ NUM1, most of the @ LOCATION3 airships used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. New York is one of the largest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take the risk. Another problem was the wind. At these heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and the winds reached a high speed. If the airship were to be blown into the city center and hit a building spire, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. Once the risks and rewards were balanced, they realized it just wasn't worth it.        

<START>

 

The obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced were severe. They had to figure out how they were going to land the airships on the mooring mast. Another problem was that the government was becoming impassive. What made matters worse was that Al Smith was devious and unmoved. He lied about living up to the act. He lied about how he was going to solve the mooring mast issues. They were also concerned that an airship would explode on the mooring mast like the @ CAPS1. So they just put it aside and over time made the tallest soda fountain and tea garden in the world for use by tourists.       

<START>

 

One of the problems that the builders faced was that they had to make the mast big enough. Some airships would be @ NUM1 feet long. If he had just dropped a mast over the Empire State Building due to the strain of a thousand foot airship held to the Empire State Building by a single cable tie, the building structure would suffer a lot. constraints. If they were supporting the weight of the airship and the wind, all that strain and pressure would be put on the foundations of the buildings that were nearly eleven hundred feet below, which wasn't safe at all. They had to go through all the different possibilities and they also had to make sure that everything would be safe. When designing the mast, they had to take into account the winds at the top of the building, the winds were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. If they designed a good mast, the airship would be suspended above the pedestrians, which was uncertain.      

<START>

 

There were three main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they attempted to allow the airships to tie up to the mooring mast. The first obstacle was "nature itself", which means that the air currents at the top of the Empire State Building were so powerful that the wind was constantly changing direction. This meant that if an airship could somehow fly through the winds and be attached to the mast, it would "pivot around and around" and end up "hanging over pedestrians", which " was neither practical nor safe ". @ CAPS1, An airship is not legally allowed to dock at the mooring mast because it "would fly too low over urban areas" against which there is an "existing law". This is a problem for builders because no matter how hard they attempted to allow airships to dock, they would not be legally allowed to tie airships to the mooring mast. Finally, many airships used hydrogen gas as firel. Hydrogen gas is " highly flammable " and therefore an airship using hydrogen gas is also highly flammable and could potentially cause disaster in " a densely populated area like downtown New York ". Due to potential fires, city laws and drafts, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to tie up to the mooring mast. .

According to the clip "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION3, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow airships, or airships, to dock there. One of the reasons it was difficult to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building was security concerns. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted, "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." With New York and its dense population, this is a risk that cannot be taken. Another obstacle faced by the architects of the Empire State Building was nature itself. The beginning of the paragraph @ NUM1 reads : “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts. " With strong winds, the airship even tied to the mast, pivoterait around the mooring mast. Another difficulty in mooring airships was, according to the excerpt from paragraph @ NUM2, "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas". Because of this law, it would be illegal for a vessel to tie up to the building or even approach the area. A final hurdle that manufacturers faced was the advancement of airplanes and this made it difficult for airships to be the primary source of aviation transport. Even though the builders put a lot of time and effort into making the Empire State Building a national @ CAPS1, they overlooked many potential issues with the mooring mast resulting in it never reaching its full potential.             

<START>

 

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" written by Marcia Amidon lüsted, she explained the challenges faced by airships when attempting to dock with the Empire State Building. The @ CAPS1 had to take into account the obstacles in the constitution of the airships, the structure of the building and the weather conditions in order to try to create a landing zone for the airships. A mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Airships have to be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make airships less dense. Being very flammable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building decided that if the airship caught fire, it would be a much bigger disaster in a populated area. Another factor that stopped airships from docking was the structure of the building. Docking an airship adds additional stress to the Empire State Building. The @ CAPS1 were forced to design the frame of the building so that it was strong enough not to collapse under the added pressure. It took time and "over sixty thousand dollars worth of structural changes to make." Finally the weather conditions tested the @ CAPS1, at the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictable. They often move because of the "violent draft". No matter how the builder attaches the airship to the mast, the airship will be dangerous. Due to the winds, the building structure as well as the airship, the @ CAPS1 was unable to create a docking area for the airships on the Empire State Building.              

<START>

 

The work faces many issues with the construction of docks for airships to land on the docks attached to the Empire State Building. In paragraph @ NUM1, it is stated that airships have disappeared and have become the transport of the future. The Empire State Building never succeeded in fulfilling its functions for airships.  

<START>

 

When Al Smith first came up with the idea of building a mast to moor airships on, it started as a friendly competition. However, no one predicted the obstacles that would be encountered in trying to execute the plan. One of those obstacles was simply that it was not safe. The airships used hydrogen, which is very flammable. If there was an accident, the results would be devastating in populated places like New York City. Another obstacle was the wind. Wind currents at the top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the airship to tip from side to side, which was dangerous for the passengers. Another obstacle was the fact that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying below a certain height in cities. Obviously, many obstacles were encountered and the mast never ended up fulfilling its function.        

<START>

 

According to the excerpt, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would need to be altered and reinforced. to accommodate the mooring mast, and rather than building a utility mast without any ornamentation, the architect designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within, with a recessed design which mimicked the general shape of the building itself.

Based on @ CAPS1 "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Many obstetricians came up with the construction of the Empire State Building with Al Smith building the entire building. With Al Smith constructing the entire building, he was determined to exceed the height. Al Smith secretly constructed an 185-foot spire inside the building, which shocked the media and the public by hoisting it to the top of the Chrysler Building. Another obstacle encountered during the construction of the Empire State Building was the idea of having airships that could dock at the very top of the building. The idea of having the airships moored atop the Empire State Building, the airships would only be held by a single tether cable, which would add stress to the building's frame. The biggest obstacle to building the Empire State Building with the idea of mooring airships at the top was security. Most airships outside of the United States have used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable and if anything were to happen it could destroy New York City. These are the reasons the builders of the Empire State Building faced my obsticals in @ CAPS1 "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION1.        

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in completing the landing dock for the airships. The first problem was the frame of the building. The frame was not strong enough to support the airships when docked, so the frame had to be reinforced to withstand the strain the airships would present. The next problem was the lack of a suitable landing zone. They decided to put an anchor at the top of the building to secure the airships when docked. The anchor was a winch at the top of the building, but the high winds at the top of the building did not allow the airship pilot to get close enough to the anchor lest the airship be pierced by a nearby building. Another reason the airships could not be docked atop the Empire State Building is the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. A few attempts have been made, but to date no one has successfully docked an airship atop the Empire State Building.      

<START>

 

The Empire State Building is known for its large size and distinctive shape in New York's @ CAPS1, but what most people probably don't know is that the tower at the top is actually a flagpole. mooring for airships. This is probably a little known fact as it could never be used to moor airships for many reasons: safety, nature, and the law. The mast would have revolutionized travel to New York if international airships could stop there after long transatlantic flights, however, because of the gas used by foreign airships, safety would have been a huge issue. In paragraph @ NUM1, the author states that "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." There was even an accident with the German Hindenburg, and if an airship caught fire above the densely populated @ CAPS2 it would be an even bigger safety concern. Nature was also a matter of security that had to be taken into account. At such a great height there are strong and unpredictable winds, and "even if the airships were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast" (paragraph @ NUM2). There was no way to anchor the rear of the airship as heavy weights such as those that would be used in open field landings would pose a serious threat hanging from the back of an airship more than @ NUM3 feet with pedestrians underneath There was simply no practical way to combat the nature that precluded the possibility of an airship down. Finally, it would have been illegal for an airship to tie up to the mooring mass on the Empire State Building. It was against the law for "airships flying too low over urban areas" (¶ @ NUM4). The law ended up being the last hurdle that couldn't be overcome, so the Empire State Building never became an airship berth, but it's still an incredible architectural feat.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles and attempted to allow the airships to dock there. One of them was that they had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the framing of the buildings, as mooring an airship to the building would put a lot of pressure on the framing and foundation of the building. Another problem was that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen which was highly flammable and an accident in this building would be very dangerous as it is a densely populated area. Nature was considered the greatest obstacle " The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong air currents ". (line @ NUM1) The airship would rock back and forth uncontrollably. This would endanger the pedestrians below and the passengers of the airship. Finally, a law was in place against airships flying too low in urban areas. All of these obstacles made it impossible to dock an airship here.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast", the builders found many obstacles in the way for airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. Some of these obstacles were as follows. The main concern was the safety of boarding and disembarking passengers as well as those underneath. The concern for those below was how the airship sometimes floated on hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. So they didn't want the airship to explode. Another main concern was that there was an "existing law on airships flying low over urban areas" (by @ NUM1). tied up would turn around the mooring due to the strong wind currents. The winds were changing all the time, so it was a really big safety issue. Another obstacle was the mooring of the airship, which was mainly put in place out of jealousy. The man was jealous because his competitor Al Smith was catching up to him before the idea of the airship occurred to him.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" from @ PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the hurdles they faced was finding a convenient and safe way to moor the airships. Convenience and safety were an obstacle as the builders of the Empire State Building were the first to attempt to dock airships on air, @ CAPS1 to which they had no previous tests to refer to. In this project, practicality and security worked together. For example "..the engineers [had to] come up with a practical and workable arrangement ..." @ CAPS1 so that airships could be moored to the mast easily and safely. This would ensure the safety of the passengers as well as the stability of the vessel. The second hurdle that the builders faced was spreading the added stress to the building when the airship docked. "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." @ CAPS2 all that stress on the foundation was a challenge because the foundation "... was almost eleven hundred feet below." Another challenge that arose was that, in order to accommodate this situation, “ the steel frame [of the building] had to be altered and strengthened ... ” The alteration of the building's framing was worth “ over sixty thousand. dollars ... ”In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempted to dock airships in their building.

Al Smith and other workers work on the Empire State Building. They had a few issues with the project like they couldn't get it as high as they wanted. They had to repair the mast skeleton if they wanted to do more. Airships for example. “Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on @ DATE1 . This explains that they got a law after that. They can't have things near urban areas. It proves that there was @ CAPS1 with the Empire State Building they were working around.      

<START>

 

The obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building were numerous. First of all, if they had made their plans for the mooring mast without considering the weight of the airship, the vessel would surely have too much stress on the foundation when docking. Then the fact that the airship weighs even less than air is both negative and positive. On the negative side, it is the strong winds that would take control of the rear of the airship. Over the city's many pedestrians, this idea was quickly deemed dangerous. Finally, it was filled with hydrogen, which naturally is highly flammable. The use of hydrogen was very dangerous and only added to the negative side of the project.

These were many of the obstacles the Empire State Building @ ORGANIZATION2 encountered while attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of these obstacles was the load stress of the airships and the wind pressure was not able to transmit to the foundations of the buildings, which were nearly @ NUM1 feet below. Another thing that was a hindrance for @ ORGANIZATION2 was that it was a lot of money, it was over sixty thousand dollars of modifications that needed to be made to the building frame. Also, architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of @ ORGANIZATION1. The last obstacle was security. Most airships from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, which hydrogen is highly flammable. This led to an accident on May 6, 1937, the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had happened in downtown New York. Here are some obstacles that @ ORGANIZATION2 from @ ORGANIZATION2 faced.

In The Mooring Mast, by @ ORGANIZATION2, there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was that the architects couldn't drop the mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building. A thousand foot airship would add stress to the structure of the building. This means that the still image should be changed and enhanced. Another setback was that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Nature itself was the biggest obstacle. The winds at the top of the building were still turning due to the strong draft. If the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot. Lead weights were an option, but using them, where they would hang above pedestrians on the street, was not safe. The other practical reason that airships couldn't get over the Empire State Building was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel.

There were many different obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles encountered was the lack of a suitable landing zone for their extended use in New York. Another obstacle was that most airships coming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. These are some of the various obstacles they faced that caused the lack of success.

On December 11, 1929, a man named Al Smith announced that he was building the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. This building was the Empire State Building in New York, which would be used for mooring an airship. , this would prevent the airship mooring from being used. Al Smith announced that he was building this mooring mast, but did not announce the potential hurdles the Empire State Building builders would face when trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the biggest obstacles would be the wind factor, causing the rear of the airship to sway. Another problem would be that foreign airships filled with flammable gases were moored too close to a densely populated area. Also, before airships could be docked, builders had to spend more time and money to make the building much stronger, to hold the airships.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One was that architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. The thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's frame. The second problem was the stress of the load on the airship and the wind pressure had to be transmitted to the foundations of the buildings. The third problem was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and reinforced to adapt to the new situation. It was over sixty thousand dollars to frame the buildings. But unfortunately not all the problems were solved and the height made it desirable to postpone to a later date but instead of becoming the transport of the future, they had been handed over to the planes.      

<START>

 

When architects first considered creating a safe landing zone for airships, they considered several key factors. The Empire State Building is over @ NUM1 feet tall, at these heights the winds get very strong and would blow the diridible all over the place. This has been proven in paragraph @ NUM2. The Goodyear airship called the "Columbia" attempted to reach the mooring mast although they had a skilled pilot, it was unable to approach the steel balloon close enough to dock on the Spire. Another factor the architects didn't factor into the equation was that most airships were filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. If a zeppelin caught fire, it would be a huge ball of fire descending through the streets of downtown New York. The "Hindenburg" set us the example which was all we needed to see to change our mind about wanting a huge flammable balloon hovering over the streets of New York.

According to the excerpt, there were a few hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One reason was that "most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." The owners of the Empire State Building realized that if an airship were destroyed by fire over a densely populated area like New York City, there could have been a huge academy. One of the biggest obstacles, however, was nature itself. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast." When airships were trying to dock, sometimes they couldn't even approach the building because of the strong winds. By hanging airships above pedestrians on the streets of New York, it was seen as impractical and dangerous. For reasons of nature and safety, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered some problems allowing airships to dock there.     

<START>

 

In paragraph 6 it said "New York City was the lack of a suitable landing space" Another obstacle in paragraph @ NUM1 was nature itself, the winds were pushing the airship aft. The other obstacle was in paragraph @ NUM2 the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the problems that Empire builders faced  

<START>

 

The builders and engineers involved in enabling the Empire State Building to dock airships to a mooring mast about one thousand two hundred and fifty feet in the air encountered many obstacles. In @ ORGANIZATION2's "The Mooring Mast", taken from the Empire State Building, the reader is guided through the journey by allowing airships, or airships, to refuel and carry passengers to the top of the mountain. 'Empire State Building. It was not an easy task; in fact, it was never achieved. Some of the reasons for this are the building itself. The mooring mast had to be on top of the building, and its height, weight, and wind pressure on the building were dangerous. In paragraph nine, it is stated that: “More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the building. But more than the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York City created some major hurdles. First, most international airships used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. A fire or explosion at the site of the mooring mast would be devastating for the city. Second, there were changing winds " due to strong drafts " at the top of the building. They deflected the back of the airship. However, the weights could not be used on the airship, due to the people below and the height at which it was all happening. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So basically the goal of this project could only be achieved if the legislation was changed. All of these obstacles made it very difficult to dock the airships on top of the Empire State Building's mooring mast, but airships attempted to land there. The US Navy airship "Los Angeles" and the Goodyear airship "Columbia" failed to land due to high winds and sharp arrows from nearby buildings. This project is an example of a beneficial idea that was nearly impossible to execute.

From the excerpt, I don't think they should have attempted to allow the airships to dock there. From the snippet, I think it's because something really bad could have happened and something probably did, but at the time they really had no choice but to the balls.

There were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the derigibles to dock there. In the excerpt, the author states that nature is one of the biggest problems for the mast. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." The author explains that the wind at the top of buildings is dangerous for the airship. "The winds at the top of the buildings were constantly moving due to strong air currents." The author also describes what the airship would do as a wind effect. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast. These were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to moor there.

The hurdles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airship adoption there were very difficult for them. An airship to land on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building. Would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith asked the builders to make the Empire State Building taller. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in the shape of a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The only obstacle the builders made was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing zone. The other hurdles were that the architects and builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, making equipment tours and docking operations. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself.         

<START>

 

This “transport of the future” project for the Empire State Building was no small feat. One of the main obstacles was the "constraint on the building frame". The workers had to make over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the airships. This would strengthen the frame of the building so that the wind pressure is "transmitted to the foundation of the building". Another problem with this mooring mast was the "strong drafts" which "constantly shifted" the winds to the roof. This would cause the airship to rotate around the building while it was docked. Allowing these giant planes to "hang over pedestrians in the street" was "neither practical nor safe. These obstacles prompted workers and architects to postpone construction.      

<START>

 

One of the original purposes of the Empire State Building was to be a loading dock for airships or airships. It was meant to help New York City be a leader in modern travel. However, many obstacles ended up putting an end to the idea of a mooring mast. A major problem was nature itself. The wind at the top of the building was constantly changing due to the drafts. This would cause the airship to swing around the mast. The idea of ballasting the back was immediately ruled out due to the danger posed to pedestrians in the street. There was also a law that stated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas, which would make it illegal and airship to dock or even approach the area.       

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to prevent airships from docking atop their building. They faced obstacles like laws, security concerns and also natural problems when they tried to make this brave idea come to fruition. They were first faced with the problems of the law, "An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law posed a barrier to builders as they had to moor the airship without flying in that flying area. The second problem was to deal with safety, "when the Hindenburg airship was destroyed ... The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been in downtown New York." After airships were found to be highly flammable, builders found that an accident over people in New York City would be worse than a rural area.Finally, builders face issues with nature, “The Los Angeles airship approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to moor due to high winds.” @ LOCATION2 at the top of the building was not appropriate for an airship. Those designers had more than a trivial idea, but it was shot with the multiple obstacles that arose.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below." This indicates that the stress of the airships and their instability will put a strain on the foundation of the building and they don't want that stress spreading over the building. They also say that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong air current." however, they fear that the wind could push the balloon away from the building and injure people. These are just a few hurdles that manufacturers have faced.

The builders encountered several obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building. One of the biggest and most difficult obstacles to overcome is the safety of everyone. Builders had to be concerned about the safety of people entering and exiting the airship, people on nearby streets, and people on the side of the building. Safety was one of the main reasons the wharf was never completed. Another huge hurdle that builders faced was nature. This is true because the winds at the top of tall buildings were always changing and that would make it difficult to land the airship on them. As the extract from paragraph @ NUM1 indicates, the airships were ballasted at the rear by lead weights, which would pose a problem for pedestrians walking under the streets.

There are a few hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of those obstacles is that it would add stress to the building frame. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1, it says : "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame". Another obstacle was that the steel would have to be changed. "The steel of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation."

The idea was a little unrealistic at first. When these airships attempted to tie up to this building, the building structure would not be able to withstand the high winds and the zeppelin. This caused a lot of problems. What if the airship tried to dock and the strong winds blew on its tail to strike a building. The Hindenburg, another zeppelin, was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @ ORGANIZATION1. If a disaster like this happened in such a crowded place, it would be chaos. Inconvenient and dangerous, this plan would not work. They would need something more stable. The plans for this have not been fully thought out. All of these problems, combined, would cause them to postpone construction of the landing gear. These plans for the “new” era of airship transport would never come true. Airplanes were a new, safer and more efficient means of transportation.           

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles that prevented airships from docking there. One of the main concerns was safety, after Hindenburg, a German airship, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. It made people realize that if such a disaster had happened in New York, a densely populated urban area, it could have been much worse. Another obstacle encountered was the bad weather conditions. The winds atop the Empire State Building were constantly changing, making it impossible for an airship to stand still. If the airship was so unstable, it would be very dangerous for it to float above millions of people. Finally, it was illegal for an airship to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the hurdles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it's obvious that airships just weren't meant to dock there.

The idea of mooring the airships on the mooring mast was very smart and could have been great. However, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered problems in trying to achieve this goal. One of the problems was that the wind forces were strong two to allow an airship to tie up to the mast. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast" (¶ @ NUM1) . Another reason is the safety of people. Not all airships were made the same. In other countries airships contained different types of gas " Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable " (¶ @ NUM2). Since hydrogen is highly flammable, manufacturers have had to consider the safety of people flying in airships. Finally, there is a law prohibiting aircraft from flying too close to a populated area. "... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area ..." (¶ @ NUM3). Docking at the Empire State Building was a great idea, but the builders faced too many challenges.

The airships had a top speed of eighty miles. Some were up to a thousand feet long, the same length as four city blocks in New York City. Thus, the only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He said a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow airships to dock there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers get on and off. The airships were moored by means of an electric winch, which pulled a line from the ship, then tied it to a mast so that, by swinging the body, passengers could get on and off safely.

The issues that the workers had to face in letting the airships dock at the Empire State Building were crucial & @ CAPS1 Because first if they tried to put a mooring mast on the roof of the building then having a thousand pound blimp on top of It holdn @ CAPS2 would be a lot to keep it going. And the strain of the airship's weight and the wind pressure will have to be transmitted to the foundation of the buildings that was 11 hundred feet below. under the building for it to be successful, but the main reason it was difficult for workers was because of the Convenient or Safe winds. 

<START>

 

During the construction of the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles. During the planning process, the @ CAPS1 of building architects began to realize that there could be many complications. Several complications occurred during the process. The architects noticed that the building itself was not designed to add additional rooms. As one architect put it, "he couldn't just drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof of the Empire State Building." Wind was another difficult factor in the construction of the Empire State Building itself. If ' held by a single cable tie, it would add stress to the building frame. Engineers will also be concerned about building issues. " The Empire State Building steel frame should be amended and strengthened to adapt to this new situation. Safety and nature also played a big role in the obstacles in the construction of the Empire State Building. The architects planned to keep the airships very high. wanting to do this could be very dangerous. “ Hanging over pedestrians in the street was neither practical nor safe. The construction of the airship is said to have caused numerous accidents, injuries and deaths. Nature would also be involved in this plan. »Open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights. If one day there had been very strong winds, this object could have fallen and caused serious danger.              

<START>

 

Although the builders of the Empire State Building managed to overcome some of the obstacles by allowing airships to dock there, many problems remained unresolved. When designing the mast to accommodate the airship, the architects realized the pressure this would put on the building's frame. In order to support the weight of the airship, they had to make “more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications” (paragraph @ NUM1) to the structure of the building. Additionally, builders had to develop a way to attach the airship to the building to allow passengers and supplies to disembark. Therefore, the architects designed a "rocket-shaped mast ... in shiny aluminum ... which also housed elevators and stairs" (paragraph @ NUM2). However, the builders forgot to incorporate the winds at the top of the building. Once the front of the airship docked, the rear of the airship swiveled irradiatingly. In addition, manufacturers have ignored existing laws that prohibited airships from flying low over cities, as noted in paragraph @ NUM3. This precaution was due to the danger that these airships posed for safety, as they were highly flammable due to the hydrogen used. These towering obstacles made the use of the Empire State Building an unrealistic platform.

In the excerpt from @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders went through many obstacles to try to allow the dringibles to moor on the Empire State Building. At first, Al Smith wanted this newly designed building to be the tallest in the world. Now that 1,250-foot building would reach new heights by adding a top hat to the building and allowing dredgers to tie up to it. Passengers getting on and off the airship, as well as the driver refueling his engine. While this was a great idea, there were a lot of issues the builder didn't see, and that's because the thousand-foot airship would add stress to the framing of the buildings. The wind would also add thousands of dollars in damage, to ensure that no damage would be done to the building or to New York residents, the Empire State Building's steel frame would need to be reinforced. It cost New York City more than @ MONEY1 in hopes of putting it on the modern travel map.

The obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock on the building were the lack of surface area, the populated area, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. "Also known today as airships, airships were actually huge balloons framed in steel, with cotton cloth envelopes filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. . " Hydrogen is very dangerous and flammable and the Empire State Building is located in a populated area, so taking risks is dangerous. Plus, since the German airship "Hindenburg" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it proved to the owners of the Empire State Building that it is more dangerous than it looks. Another reason that airships could not dock at the top of the building was the current law prohibiting all airships flying too low over populated areas.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast", by @ ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the state building empire faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. They had to come up with a safe plan that included building designs and fix issues they didn't see from the start. The first hurdle was meeting with the Navy and other experts to come up with a safe and practical plan. They had to find a way to land the airships without adding stress to the framing of the buildings and without spending @ MONEY1 to reinforce it. The builders came up with a plan that included what the mast should be made of and what would be on each floor. They even had to finish the roof before the cold mooring mast took place. The biggest obstacle was the one they hadn't seen from the start. While building the mooring mast, they would have to face obstacles that nature brought, which was simply impossible. Safety was the main issue. if a fire did occur, there would be a disaster. The winds were too strong due to strong drafts and there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low. After all this work, they couldn't get past the obstacles, and the mooring mast was never built.

Second, most foreign airships were highly flammable, which made them very dangerous for two overcrowded moorlands in New York City. Nature itself was also a problem. The winds at the top of the building were so strong that it would be dangerous to moor there. And finally, the law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas.

The Empire State Building was built as the tallest building in the world and remains one of the tallest to this day. However, he had design plans with more focus than being the tallest building. It was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for airships. Most people don't know this because there were many complications involved in the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. The architects knew that it wouldn't be easy to build such a creation and that they "couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building." They knew, for example, that the building had to be modified to accommodate the additional stresses of the mast and that the height of the building would have to be increased. They made the necessary modifications to the building, but the realities of the project quickly set in and the mast was never built, "the biggest reason being safety." The hydrogen used to power airships was highly flammable and endangered the citizens of New York. Moreover, according to the article, "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". There are strong winds at this altitude which would blow and make it difficult to control and navigate the airships.

Based on "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles in their attempts to allow the airships to anchor to the top of the building. An airship moored to the top of the building held by a single tether cable adds stress to the building frame, architects had to find a way to pass the stress of wind pressure and blimps load to the foundation @ ORGANIZATION1 . Safety had played a major role in the fate of the mooring mast. Outside of the United States, most airships used hydrogen rather than helium, with hydrogen being highly flammable. If an airship caught fire over a densely populated area, there would be disaster. The biggest obstacle to using the mooring mast was nature. Above the Empire State Building the wind was constantly changing due to the strong air currents, even if an airship was attached to the mooring mast, the rear of the form would still be unstable to land.

In the excerpt written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, she describes the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. In the excerpt, the author told readers that after the Empire State Building was built, builders needed to rebuild the entire building and needed to make the roof stronger. "The metal frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation" (paragraph @ NUM1). Construction workers also had to work at a height of 1,250 feet. They not only had to rebuild the foundation and the solidity of the building, but also the top. "Two months after the workers celebrated the framing of the entire building, they were back to hoist an American flag again - this time on top of the mooring mast frame." These are just a few of the many hardships workers have faced.      

<START>

 

The hurdles the builders faced with the Empire State Building were that they didn't have enough technology to land an airship on the mooring mast. February 1931 @ CAPS1 clavan from the architectural office of the building declared "The still unresolved problems of mooring the airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone the final installation of the train to a later date. landing " After @ CAPS1 clavan stated that the use of airships is gone. by the end of the 1930s, airships had been given to airplanes. The builder also had to build an electric winch and a group board. The electric winch is pulled in line from the bow of the ship, then attached to the mast and a group plank to an open viewing platform.

It was once said “ where there is a will, there is a way ”. However, they did not include the part about the obstacles that you will have to go through. For example, how it was a will and a way for the mooring of airships on the Empire State Building, the architects just did not solve all the possible problems of their idea. Like the fact that only American airships used helium instead of hydrogen. In addition, the wind currents have a stronger force in the air than at the level of normal life. Also the non-ideal place they were trying to use. They should have taken into account the businessman's slogan "@ CAPS1, @ CAPS1, @ CAPS1".

At sporting events, people got used to seeing the @ CAPS1 airship or the Goodyear airship. Now they are used for advertising, but not many people know that they were once considered a means of transportation. The excerpt "The Mooring Mast", by @ ORGANIZATION2, not only shows that the Empire State Building mast was intended for mooring airships, but also shows the many problems encountered when moving airships. Safety was a big issue because airships, or airships, were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. It would be a huge disaster if one of them exploded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were always changing and there was no way to prevent airships from moving in the wind and that could be dangerous. There was also a law about how high you can fly over urban areas and to land properly you were breaking that law, and flying at that low risked pushing the airship up the building and piercing it. Al Smith had a great idea for the Empire State Building mast, but there were a lot of issues making it a reality.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The man who came up with the plan was Al Smith, who saw the opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. This would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and allow passengers to get on or off. But with it came a lot of work. And they couldn't just put a mooring mast on top of the building. The architects had to make plans on how they were going to set up the mooring mast. In the story it says, "After the architects designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the skeleton of the building, construction went as planned. When the building was framed up 'On the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mooring mast framing could take place. The mast also had a steel skeleton and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. "

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, builders faced obsession with trying to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. A @ CAPS1 face was an airship several meters moored to the top of the building, held by a single cable tie, which added stress to the building frame. the stress of the load of the airships added to the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. the Empire State Building's steel frame had to be reinforced to accommodate this.

They must have built the tower as it should or there would be some landing issues if they added the view. People would pay any price, but the price to keep it stable was not worth it. Ultimately, people wanted to make it something really popular, but it wasn't for them to decide whether or not it was popular. It ended up being a profit and a ride of a lifetime

During the construction of the Empire State Building, builders faced several obstacles in order for the airships to dock on the Empire State Building. The first hurdle the builders faced was figuring out how to modify and reinforce the Empire State Building's steel framing to accommodate the mooring mast at the top of the building. These changes would cost over sixty thousand dollars, which is a lot of money in @ DATE1. Once the builders finished framing the entire building, the biggest obstacle to building the mooring mast came. This obstacle was nature itself. strong air currents would cause the stern of the airships to swing around and around the mast. The airship would need weights to keep it stable, but those weights would be hanging over people in the street and that wasn't practical or safe.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. Airships were said to be considered the means of transportation of the future, but New York City lacked a suitable landing zone. The speed at which the airships were moving and the wind speed in the area and the heights were becoming unquestionable. The airship plan became more and more unreasonable with an accident at @ LOCATION2. For height, wind, speed and location, using airships was no longer a good idea

In "The mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building had to try to make it perfect, especially for the designers. They put in a lot of work, effort and time. They tried to make different arrangements for the government people. The airships were still near the mooring mast. They feared he would collapse one day. They, too, wanted them to become the transport of the future. Transportation was to planes. Airships have become the world's tallest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists. So their plans didn't quite work out as expected, but everything else seemed to be working fine.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while trying to dock airships to it, but they had to find a way around. The architects thought the mooring mast would work, and they started building. Quite quickly, issues evolved that could not be resolved. An example of one of their problems is that airships use more hydrogen than helium, which makes them very flammable. If the airship were to crash over New York City, many people would be injured. Another factor that goes with it are the wind currents. The wind is too strong for the airship to whirl even though it was moored. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still, but if they fell it would injure some passing pedestrians. Additionally, state law prohibited airships from flying too low, preventing airships from being tied to the Empire State Building's mooring mast. After all these problems, the architects never added the landing gear to the mooring mast because they knew it would not be used as intended.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced obstacles in trying to allow the airships to dock. An example of an obstacle that builders faced was how to tie the mooring mast to the top of the building. In paragraph nine, it says: “The architects could not just lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. They had to find a safe way to tie him up. Another example of an obstacle was that they had to reinforce and modify the building because in paragraph nine it was stated that "a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress. to the frame of the building. " The last example was in paragraph nine when they explained that" the stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. " The stress could be so great on the building that it could cause it to collapse.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building would have had to face many consequences in attempting to allow airships to dock there. A full-sized dirigible made of "huge steel-framed balloons". They were going at a speed of " 80 km / h and could go 70 kilometers per hour. The Empire State Building's willingness to face the " building suspended above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe ." And even if the dirigibe landed on them the ship would "spin around and around", making the vessel more mobile. Even if the vessel landed, it was "illegal for a vessel to dock the vessel or even approach the area."      

<START>

 

In addition to the changes to the building plans, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in terms of safety, practicality and legality. The hydrogen used in most foreign airships is highly flammable, posing an extreme safety hazard "over a densely populated area like downtown New York." Also, because of the natural and violent wind currents at the altitude of the mooring mast, it would be more difficult, and dangerous, to weigh down the airships at the dock. Finally, the plans for the construction of the Empire State Building did not correspond to the laws in force. Laws prohibited airships from traveling at low altitudes over urban areas; therefore, the use of the mooring mast would be illegal. Before the builders could complete the Empire State Building, they had to carefully consider each of these obstacles.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Originally, the biggest problem faced by builders was to reinforce the building's foundation base in order to withstand the stress of airship load and wind pressure. To combat this, @ MONEY1 modifications had to be made to the building frame. Unfortunately, most of the complications of the mooring mast were not addressed until after it was built. One of the most important was safety, in that many foreign airships use helium to float, which is highly flammable. A catastrophe like Hindenburg's in New York is too dangerous to risk. Another obstacle of the mast was the winds at the top of the building which were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. The swinging airship could not be secured with suspended weights due to the danger of dropping one over a heavily populated New York City. A huge complication in making the dream a reality was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. This would make any mooring illegal. The many hurdles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building trying to get airships to dock there ultimately led to the idea being scrapped.

The builders of the Empire State encountered obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized just how worse the accident could have been over a densely populated area. like downtown New York. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. Another hurdle that builders faced was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to dock with the building, or even approach the area, although two airships attempted to reach the building before the idea was scrapped.

It is stated in the article that "[t] he Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose," and it turns out to be true. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to dock the airships to the building. For example, one of the obstacles encountered is that most airships are filled with hydrogen which is an extremely flammable gas, and if an airship is destroyed by fire like the Hindenburg, it could cause a terrible accident in a densely packed area. populated like New York. Therefore, builders face a safety issue with airships if one catches fire in New York City. Another significant obstacle is that the strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building cause the airships to rotate around the mooring mast, preventing the airships from getting close enough to the mooring mass. In addition, the wind creates a risk that an airship could be blown on a sharp arrow from another vessel, "and the airship could be punctured, causing a dangerous situation for the captain. Weight the airship so that it does not swivel as much in the wind, controllers should use lead weights. Although lead weights reduce swivel, this is not practical or safe as lead weights would hang over pedestrians on the street , and if a lead weight fell, it could be fatal. Finally, if the airship docked at the Empire State Building, it would violate an existing law. This law states that airships cannot fly at low altitudes at- above urban areas, so it is clear that it is illegal to dock on the Empire State Building.Before this project was started, builders should have researched or explained all the obstacles they were going to face.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as structural support issues, shifting winds, and administrative interference. A major problem arose when they realized that the force to hold the airship in place "should be transmitted to the foundation of the building" (par. @ NUM1). This meant that builders had to make changes to the support system of the building itself before they could begin construction of the mooring device. After the mast and the rebuilding work were completed, the builders realized that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly turning due to strong drafts" (par. @ NUM2), which would make docking almost impossible. . Mooring attempts became even more difficult because "the complete airship mooring equipment had never been installed" (par. @ NUM3). It shows how the builders struggled with bureaucracy in their attempts to build the mooring mast. In conclusion, the myopia of the project led the builders to grapple with the building structure, the weather conditions and the owners' vision, before finally abandoning the mast.      

<START>

 

The obstacles that the builders had to overcome were very difficult. It was difficult because the building was so high in the air. They needed special equipment to do it. Al Smith had to wait for a response before building the mast because it was dangerous. More than sixty thousand dollars had to be brought to the frame of the building. The other obsticals had to get off and let the passengers get on. Also for recharging your airships if you had one. And it was just to make the building bigger.

Manufacturers faced many obstacles when attempting to allow airships to dock. The first was that they couldn't just put the mast on top of the building, it would put too much pressure on the building frame. They had to transmit the stress to the foundations of the building. They did more @ MONEY1 from framing to the building. Their next hurdle was to find a safe way to moor and unload the ships, which was impossible. First of all, the ship couldn't even reach the building because the constantly changing high winds were too strong to control the ship. But even if they did dock, the stern of the ship would have been pushed around and around the mast. Another obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying this low over urban areas. So now the ships could no longer approach the building to attach to the mast.

Although the problems of mooring an airship were not taken into account at first, the builders of the Empire State Building eventually faced these obstacles. Their "biggest reason was safety" for passengers and pedestrians below the city. Many countries "have used hydrogen rather than helium" in their airships, and "hydrogen is highly flammable", which could have caused several problems in the future. A German airship called the Hindenburg was destroyed in Lakehurst, @ CAPS1 due to a fire, and it was after this incident that the owners of the Empire State Building realized that such an accident could not take place "in over a densely populated area like downtown New York, "because too many people could be injured. Even though safety was a big issue," the biggest obstacle ... was nature itself " . When an airship was “ tied to the mooring mast ,” violent air currents at the top of the vessel caused the “ stern of the ship to rotate .” The air currents not only made the stability of the vessel difficult. airship, it was also extremely difficult to reach the mooring mast. The idea of using lead weights to hold the end of the airships was not used as the weights hanging above @ CAPS2 “were neither practical nor safe.” a final obstacle to which the manufacturers were confro ntés was the "law against airships flying too low over urban areas". This law prevented any airship from being tied up or even approaching the building. However, two airships (US Navy Los Angeles and Goodyear's @ LOCATION4) attempted to reach the building but were stopped due to the wind speed. The many obstacles that presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building prevented the mooring mast from being used for the future of transportation.

In this short passage, he explains how the architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in New York State. This mast would moor airships, which are now called airships. The mooring mast is a skinny tower atop the Empire State Building for mooring airships. The Empire State Building is @ NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at the top. The stress of an airship on a mooring mast at @ NUM2 feet represents a lot of weight at this height of a structure. They put @ MONEY1 of modifications in this agreement for the base building area. A significant drawback of airships is that with helium they are highly flammable and could cost several million dollars in damage. If the zeppelin caught fire over such a densely populated area of land, it could cost many lives. I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building to be the tallest building at the same time. They should still use the mooring mast today.

With architects blind to potential mast problems, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. There was a law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. But let's say a ship was tied to the mooring mast, the aft end of the ship would pivot around the mass due to the constant changing winds due to the strong air currents. Airships are normally moored in open fields, which makes it possible to weigh down the back with lead weights. It was dangerous for many reasons, but mainly because the weights would be hanging in downtown New York. Without the airship, the high winds would push the ship into sharp arrows that would rip through the hull. With the wind pressure and the load of the airships itself, too much stress would be added to the framing of the buildings. To the steel framing of the building, over sixty thousand dollars in alterations would have to be made so that the stress could be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet to the foundation. Most airships made in the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. With hydrogen being more flammable, the owners of the Empire State Building realized just how worse the crash could have been if it had happened over downtown New York. With all of these obstacles in their way, the owners and builders of the Empire State Building voted to postpone the installation of the landing gear.

"The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose." Then they had more problems because a law was being passed that said ships couldn't attach themselves to buildings, they didn't want anyone to visit the building. But they solved this problem by asking the planes to bring in the passengers. Even though the manufacturers went through many obstacles, they still managed to overcome them.

Throughout the extract, the obstacles encountered by the builders were difficult. Many have found it impossible to allow airships to dock there. Some difficulties encountered were that outside of States more airships were being made, but with "hydrogen rather than helium". they declared that " hydrogen is highly flammable ". There was fear for the people because New York was so densely populated. There were also problems. The winds were constantly changing. "The ship would swing around and around."

During the construction of the Empire State Building, the @ CAPS1 encountered many problems before and after the mast was made. There were laws preventing the docking of airships, incidents that had occurred, and breaches of security. The first issue they should have addressed was the law banning low-flying planes over urban areas. It is said that "this law would make it illegal for a vessel to dock or even approach the area". Another problem encountered was the burning of the Hindenburg. The United States used helium to keep their airships afloat while other countries used highly flammable hydrogen. This posed a big threat and @ CAPS1 even started to wonder "how much worse this incident would be if it had taken place over a densely populated area like downtown New York. The last problem was how dangerous it was to have an airship swaying in the high winds near the building. The cargo would send the airship out of control in those winds.

This was because most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen, not helium, hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse a fire could have been had it occurred over a densely populated area like downtown New York.

When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to build a mooring mast for airships, they encountered several obstacles that would eventually overcome them. The first and most obvious obstacle was the danger of crashing. When the Hindenburg crashed in New Jersey, the builders realized just how much worse this horrific crash would have been in downtown New York. Another more present obstacle was the wind at the top of the tower. As stated in paragraph @ NUM1 "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts." This coupled with the lightweight nature of airships would make docking much more difficult than on an open field. The last hurdle that the builders faced was the existing laws that made it illegal. There were laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City, although they were largely ignored. All of these obstacles ultimately led to the realization that the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was not practical or achievable.

Based on the information I just read about the obstacles that builders faced while building the empire, it was about finding a way to allow airships to dock there. There are rooms that have never been open to the public and it is the highest observation desk. They had to make room for a dock, but they didn't know how. The builders were faced with the fact that the city did not want "airships to dock with the Empire State Building because the law prohibited airships flying low over urban areas. They also had complications, the airship hull captain could not let go of the control levers. arrows from other buildings could pop airships. Wind was also a problem as it could point airships in a different direction.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock theirs. One obstacle was that an airship moored to the top of the building held by a single cable, would add stress to the structure of the building. The stationary frame of the building should be modified and reinforced to withstand the stresses of airship load and wind pressure. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly changing due to strong air currents, causing the ship to rotate around and around the mooring mast. Another major obstacle was that there was a law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for ships to dock or even approach the building. The last hurdle the builders had to get around was the issue of safety. Most airships used either helium or hydrogen, two highly flammable gases. When the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realized how dangerous there could be in a populated area.

An accident where the German airship caught fire and was destroyed shocked the builders, but they realized it could have been worse. Nature itself was also a problem. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts." The stern of the ship would "pivot" even if it was attached. There was also a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. All these examples would lead builders to face obstacles.

Many problems were encountered by construction workers at the Empire State Building, @ CAPS1 in allowing airships to dock. For starters, building airships on the Empire State Building was dangerous. The airships couldn't do a lot of basic things to tie up to the building. For example, "airships could not dock with the Empire State Building". (@ CAPS2 @ NUM1) Docking was impossible as it was against "an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas". (@ CAPS2 @ NUM1) This made it illegal to hook up a ship to the Empire State Building. In addition, the biggest threat to airships was nature. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." (@ CAPS2 @ NUM3) For this reason and given that building such a tall building at the time was impractical, airships never touched the Empire State Building. To conclude, the difficulty of building airship landing gears and landing airships ultimately ended the docks of the Empire State Building.

In their attempt to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the builders encountered structural, safety, and practical obstacles. In order to have the mast above the building, the builders had to reinforce the steel, "Over sixty thousand dollars in modifications." In addition, they had concerns about the safety of leaving an airship docked in a city, on a skyscraper. One of those concerns was the use of the flammable hydrogen gas used in non-US airships. If an airship caught fire over the city, the effects would be bad. In addition, the mooring mast attachment system was at the mercy of nature. “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing, this meant that the airship on the mast could then rotate, which made it dangerous for the citizens. The mast was also impractical, due to a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas. And finally, in the following years, airships had " given way to airplanes ", rendering the mooring mast for airships unnecessary. The builders of the Empire State Building never succeeded in putting an active mooring mast on the building, because of the structural, safety and practical obstacles they encountered.

When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow airships to dock there, they encountered many problems. One is the added stress on the mast building. “ The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. » @ CAPS1 how stressors on the building disrupted its construction. Another obstacle to its construction was that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts." During the construction of the wharf, the builders encountered some problems that eventually overcame them and led to its uselessness.

In attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered some problems. First of all, they had to find a practical way to do it. When they decided to build a "rocket-shaped mast" that the airship could attach to, they realized that the roof had to be built first. Once the mast was built, safety became an issue. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." (paragraph @ NUM1) If there was an accident with a foreign airship, the safety of New York City would be threatened. Also, airships could not be tied up with weights like they can in an open field. It would also be dangerous for the people of New York. The main obstacle that manufacturers have faced is safety, which is a big issue. Therefore, airships could not dock on the Empire State Building.

In @ ORGANIZATION1's The Mooring Mast clip, the builders faced a giant hurdle. They risked blowing up the building. “Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable” (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) This is an example of the extract that could become the biggest obstacle. If someone exploded on top of that building, the building would die. In addition, many people would also die from it. This is one of the biggest obstacles they have faced.

The builders of the Empire State Building and encountered many obstacles while trying to set up the mooring mast for airships including weakened frame, nature and weather conditions, potential fire hazards and laws American. Because the building was not originally designed to hold airships, the frame was not strong enough to survive the airship's pull and movement through the air. The airships would also wobble in the strong and unpredictable winds at the top of the building, which had 102 floors. In addition to coming loose or damaging the building itself, airships were at risk of being punctured by another building's arrow. Damage to the airship in any way was a very dangerous possibility, as the area of New York around the Empire State Building is densely populated. If the airship catches fire and explodes, as is the case with the German airship Hindenburg, many pedestrians or other structures could be severely damaged. This kind of disaster was also likely due to the flammable gases like hydrogen used to keep airships afloat. Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building have run into issues with the US government, whose laws prohibit airships from coming as close to urban areas as @ ORGANIZATION2. It would be illegal for an airship to fly close enough to the building to moor there. In conclusion, many issues arose for the builders as they attempted to turn the Empire State Building into a docking station for airships.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many construction obstacles, especially when it came to mooring airships or airships. From the start, manufacturers faced obstacles with very high expectations. Expectations, including the desired title of " tallest building in the world ". With this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support. Another obstacle also arose: to be "equipped for the age of transport", as John Tauranac said. With the desire to now be a platform for what was called at the time the “transports of the future”, came even greater obstacles. These obstacles included the responsibility of removing passengers from airships safely. One of the biggest obstacles was the constantly changing winds and strong drafts. This problem normally solved in open fields using dangling weight belts, was almost impossible to solve in populated @ CAPS1.YC. The last obstacle that really led to the demise of the operation was the law prohibiting airships flying too low in urban areas.

The obstacles encountered by the builders of @ ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow the airships to dock there were the lack of land surface, wind currents and the gas used to float the airships. The lack of land surface was a problem because "... some [airships] were as long as @ NUM1 ft., The same length as four blocks in @ ORGANIZATION2." This could be a problem because in a densely populated area like New York City, people could be in danger of having large objects flying back and forth so close to the ground. It would also darken the light. Wind currents were a factor because at 102 stories above the ground, the wind would blow around large airships, posing a danger to the framing of buildings. "... wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundations of buildings." The final hurdle would be the gas used in many foreign airships of the time, which was hydrogen, a highly flammable and dangerous gas to have in densely populated areas like @ ORGANIZATION2. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, [they] realized how much worse the crash could have been in New York."

There were many obstacles preventing airships from landing on the Empire State Building. Most of them concerned the building structure and safety. Workers encountered obstacles with the new airship mooring plan even before construction began. In order to be able to withstand the planes, the frame of the building would have to be "modified and reinforced", otherwise there was no chance that the building would remain standing. Safety was the main issue with the completion of the plan for mooring the airships to the Empire State Building. Once everything was built and finished, it was quickly realized that the "mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose". Part of the reason for this is that foreign airships were mostly made of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely dangerous. In addition, the simple act of attaching an airship to the mast would be dangerous due to the winds that "were constantly moving due to strong air currents". Not only was it dangerous to tie up airships to the tallest building in the world, it was also illegal. Airships were not allowed to fly in populated areas at low altitudes. After the mooring mast was built, it was quickly realized that it would never be used.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were the lack of a suitable landing zone. Additionally, a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's frame. To do this, they would need a lot of money, like sixty thousand dollars. Another reason was safety, as most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of the biggest obstacles they faced were the winds at the top of the building, as the winds were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. It was also not safe to weight the airships with lead weights so that they did not pivot around the mooring mast. Also sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the framework of the buildings. They were concerned that weighing down the ship with lead weights would be dangerous because of all the people down in town. It must have been very difficult to build the mooring mast.

The Mooring Mast On December 11, 1929, Al Smith released the Empire State Building, which would reach a height of 1,250 feet, the tallest building in the world. To do this, they were going to add a mooring mast at the top of the building to moor the airships. The builders were unaware of the obstacles to come. They were faced with many architectural, @ CAPS1 and nature-based dilemmas. When designing the mast, they realized that they couldn't just put the mast on top. The wind pressure mixed with all the stress of the airship being held up by a cable would send the stress throughout the building, and even down to the foundation. (paragraph @ NUM1) To do this, it would cost more than @ NUM2 $ for the framework to work hard enough to withstand the stress. Another obstacle that came into play was @ CAPS1. In the @ LOCATION2, hydrogen is used to power the airships. Hydrogen is highly flammable, so if anything happened to downtown New York City. It would be a disaster. It was said that the biggest obstacle was nature itself. Strong air currents are unpredictable and the airship would move even if it was weighed down. But it is neither practical nor safe to weigh the ball with pedestrians below. Overall the mast result was a failure due to the blindly seen and predicted blindly predicted obstacles of nature, the @ CAPS1 architecture.

According to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders who built the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock on the building. One of the many obstacles was nature itself. The winds that are at the top of the building were always changing, due to the strong air currents. If the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the rear of the mooring mast would pivot around and around the mooring mast, as described in paragraph @ NUM1. Another obstacle was that airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. As you can see, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock on this building.

Based on the snippet, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow the airships to dock there. One of the reasons for the failure of ideas was the fact that there was already a law making it illegal for an airship to even approach the area, as noted in paragraph @ NUM1. Plus, it could have been an extreme fire hazard if an airship had ever reached the Empire State Building. This is proven in the paragraph @ NUM2, where it is written: " the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire ... " which made the owners realize " how much worse this accident could have been in New York ". On top of all this, the weather came up with an even bigger problem. The strong drafts made the idea of a mooring mast "neither practical nor safe". I believe the most important reason the idea failed is that the technology was simply advancing beyond predictions. In paragraph @ NUM3, it says: "Airships instead of becoming the means of transport of the future, have given way to airplanes."

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen in their airships instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders of the Empire State Building did not realize this was a problem until May 6, 1937, the German airship Hindenburg caught fire in New Jersey (paragraph @ NUM1). It wasn't until then that they realized how bad things would be if an airship caught fire above the masses of people in New York City. Another obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building were still changing violently, causing the airship to spin above the heads of @ LOCATION2. As indicated in paragraph @ NUM2, such a problem could be easily solved by weighing down the airship with lead weights. However, the use of pellets that could accidentally fall on people below was a dangerous way to keep the airship stationary. Finally, as written at the beginning of the @ NUM3 paragraph, there was a "law against airships flying too low over urban areas". By law, the very idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area for airships was illegal, and rightly so. There were too many complications, and a spark or a strong breeze could endanger countless lives. These reasons explain why, in the 1930s, the plan to create a mooring mass for airships on the Empire State Building was abandoned.

Governor Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to build a building that would surpass the tallest building in the world today, the Chrysler Building. He managed to do it. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. Back then, aviation pioneers dreamed of traveling by airship, and now a mooring mast had to be built on top of the building to moor these airships. But what should have been a prudent project turned out to be dangerous. There should have been a lot more precautions in this project. Airships could be very dangerous in a densely populated area like New York City. If the airship caught fire and exploded, people could be injured. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway through, which is why it was canceled for lack of security.

The obstacles that the builder faced are to make sure that the building was sufficiently stable. The architects knew they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Al Smith commented and said the docking mask was at a decent level and how they were working on things. A group of engineers strive to find workable and faster arrangements. Meanwhile, the government is trying to find a safe way for mooring airships to mast. “A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building structure (@ NUM1). The obstacles that builders encountered were if a large airship had to climb to the top of the building, it added stress by making it heavier. Also, it got to the point where it would hit the building frame. They had to use a steel frame to get things right. But, at the top of the building, the winds cause violent shifts to drafts. Having an airship suspended over pedestrians is very dangerous or even good. The builder of the Empire State Building faced many significant challenges in allowing airships to fly.

The Empire State Building has always been very famous and well known, but wanted more attention. New York Governor Al Smith attempted to allow the airships to dock on the building for transport. He was encouraged that it would work and indeed set out to build it. The builders went through a lot of hurdles to try to make it possible. To make this dream possible, the builders had to modify and strengthen the building. It wouldn't be cheap, "over sixty thousand dollars in structural alterations had to be made." It would be very expensive. The builders designed a "tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel." In addition, the mast would have four wings from all corners. Builders designed viewing areas and even elevators and baggage areas. They had it all planned out and hoisted an American flag to the top. Unfortunately, no one has considered all the dangers of mooring airships. All the work of the builders has never been there. They tried to tie up two but it didn't work. The building has become the world's tallest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists.

During the construction of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the architects encountered many obstacles. These obstacles lead designers to never effectively use the mooring mast as they had hoped. The first problem they had was that a thousand ton airship would add stress to the framing of buildings. The designers had to spend @ MONEY1 to reinforce the building frames. This first obstacle already made manufacturers doubt that it was not going to be done easily. The next thing they realized was that with hydrogen airships, they were extremely flammable. If a huge airship caught fire and fell in New York, it would be catastrophic. It also kindled their enthusiasm for the job, knowing how much of a risk it would pose. The wind above the building was constantly moving due to the drafts, causing the airship attached to the mast to spin and overturn. The designers understood that it would be neither practical nor safe to be above pedestrians on the ground. The last obstacle of all, which really killed their idea of mooring, was the airship laws. The law states that airships cannot fly so low over urban areas, which puts an illegal mark on their planes. The designers of the mooring mast had to face many obstacles in their design, and it was these obstacles that led to their mast never being used.

There were many obstacles that the architects never realized when building the docking station for the airships. One of the obstacles they faced was height and the resulting lack of security. On @ DATE1, the German airship "Hindenburg", which uses highly flammable hydrogen, caught fire in New Jersey as described in paragraph thirteen. If this had happened to an airship docked over New York City, the airship would collapse to the ground where many new @ CAPS1s would spend their day. The biggest obstacle they faced was nature. Drafts and storms would cause the airship, only attached to the mooring mast by a rope, "to pivot around and around the mooring mast ... suspended above pedestrians in the street ." As stated in paragraph fourteen, this was neither practical nor saying so. The third hurdle they faced was a pre-existing law banning airships flying too low over urbanized areas. Even as tall as the Empire State Building was, it was still impossible to legally moor to the new mooring mast. Al Smith's idea ultimately had to be scrapped due to safety, nature, and state law.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was the weight of the airship " or airship ", the pressure of the wind of lust, which put too much stress on the frame of the building. The architects easily overcome this obstacle. They reinforced the iron frame of the building so that it could withstand the additional stresses. Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for mooring airships. The biggest problem is security. Many airships used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable. There was too much risk of the airship catching fire and falling on the city. Nature was also a huge obstacle. The wind was blowing the airship into the surrounding buildings, and as it floated in the air, the weights could not hold it back. Finally, there was a law stating that planes could not fly too low in urban areas.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many obstacles were described that prevented airships from docking on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the Empire State Building had a flat roof and the building's frame would have to be reinforced to accommodate the mooring mast. Architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast above the flat roof of the Empire State Building. It cost more than @ MONEY1 to modify the frame. Another obstacle was the law. "Flying too low over urban areas" was illegal, so it would be impossible for an airship to even approach the Empire State Building. Finally, the biggest obstacle was security. The airships that flew around New York City were made using hydrogen, which is flammable. In addition, “ the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong air currents. “It wouldn't be safe to hook an airship in those winds where it was moving all around. Of course, that was also a safety hazard as thousands of pedestrians would walk on the road below,” Where [the airships] would be hanging over pedestrians on the street, "it would be terrible if one of them fell.

On the clip, there were a lot of obstacles to attempting to build the Empire State Building and securing the mooring of airships. The first obstacle to the construction of the Empire State Building was that engineer Al Smith wanted to make the Empire State Building "the tallest building in the world." "When the Empire State Building was designed, it was designed as the tallest building in the world, taller than the new Chrysler Building that was being built." (@ CAPS1 1) the problem was that the architect of the Chrysler Building had placed an 185ft spire inside the building. Al Smith had an idea that would make the Empire State Building a bigger one and a beater. Its idea would be more than an "ornament" "their top, it is said, would have a higher vocation. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an era of transport which was then only the dream of the pioneers of aviation. ". He believed he could use the building as an airship wharf, so people could get on and off. The problem was, the framework was not working. "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) They tried to land airships @ NUM2 times, but they couldn't do it in the end. "In December 1930, the US Navy airship Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM3) They could not solve the problem.

The Empire State Building started out as a huge skyscraper. Then Al Smith had to get competitive and put his team to work. The crew had many obstacles to overcome. First, they had to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the building, which cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Second, the men made a tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel, illuminated inside. Then they had to add four fenders or shiny aluminum to raise a conical roof to house the mooring arm. Fourth, the crew must add stairs and elevators to accommodate the "airship" passengers. And finally, they would add a few observation rooms to floors @ NUM1 and 102. Smith's men worked hard and overcame many obstacles while trying to get the airships to dock at the Empire State Building.

Architects and builders encountered several obstacles when they attempted to build the Empire State Building and allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was maintaining a safe environment. Airships powered by hydrogen are susceptible to destruction by fire. An example is in paragraph @ NUM1, "German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey". Another major obstacle was the high wind speed and strong air currents. These were dangerous as the stern of the ship swung around the mooring mast. Finally, another obstacle they faced was a law. In paragraph @ NUM2, it says "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas". This law would prevent airships from being able to dock there or even fly in the general area. All these obstacles could not be overcome and the mooring mast was ultimately unsuccessful.

There were a lot of obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. For example, they wanted to add more height to the Empire State Building so that it could be "outfitted for an era of transportation that was then just the dream of aviation's dream," @ PERSON1 said. Next, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building so that it could allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow airships to move up and down. passengers. "Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame." Then they "designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within, with a recessed design that mimicked the general shape of the building itself." In addition, "the rocket-shaped mast would have four angled wings, made of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms." The roof had to be finished before the mask could take place. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. In conclusion, these are the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there.

It is our duty as human beings to have dreams and want to turn them into reality. Al Smith's dream of landing airships on the Empire State Building is a dream that I consider rather erratic. There were many obstacles that turned out from the start, the fate of this project was failure. It was evident from the start of the constructions that this was surreal because "the only obstacle to their expansion in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone" (paragraph 6). Having airships passing through a large city should have been visibly impossible for Al Smith, even before the building was constructed. Safety was also something to be seriously considered since "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable", which is also linked to laws of objects flying too low over an urban area (paragraph @ NUM1).

<START>

 

The obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock on the building were pretty obvious. One obstacle was that of nature, the winds at the top of the building were high speed and constantly changing, which would make the airship unstable and difficult to moor. Another obstacle they faced was the safety of passengers and passers-by. The airship could spiral out of control putting many lives in danger. The latest hurdle the builders faced was a law prohibiting flying airships too low over urban areas, making it illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State Building. The many obstacles that builders faced blocked the completion of an airship dock atop the Empire State Building.     

<START>

 

The hurdles that builders would face would be things like structural @ CAPS1 and worrying about future technological advancements. Even if they were learning how to land an airship on the platform, what about advancements on them or new modes of transportation. The @ CAPS1 structure was a quick solution, by strengthening the supports of the building itself.  

<START>

 

There were many obstacles that the builders encountered in creating the mast. One obstacle was the flat roof of the building. An airship moored to the building by a single cable would stress the structure of the building. For this reason, the builders had to modify and strengthen the framework to resolve this obstacle. Another problem was that other countries were still using hydrogen and an explosion over New York would be devastating. One of the biggest obstacles was "nature itself". The winds at the top were constantly changing. The stern of the ship would move around the mooring mast. They had to solve this problem in a safe way. In the fields, the back of an airship was weighed down with lead, but it could not be done. It would be dangerous to let the lead hang over the heads of civilians. In addition to all of these obstacles, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. In the end, the mooring mast was a failure as all of these obstacles could not be resolved and repaired.             

<START>

 

The first stubbornness arose when the building @ PERSON1 changed height. They created the mooring mast and raised the Empire State building to NUM1ft. Then they figured out that the mast would add stress to the structure of the building. Then with the new laws and the Hindenburg that the mooring mast would not work. So they gave up trying to make it useful.    

<START>

 

First, there was no way to anchor airships. They couldn't make the back stable, only if they added lead weights; it was not a good idea above a crowded street. Second, there were laws in place stating that an airship could not fly so close to buildings. Additionally, when the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire near a naval base in New Jersey, people thought "... how much worse this accident could have been if it had happened overhead. of a densely populated area like downtown New York ". @ CAPS1, the wind up there was too strong and too strong for an airship to even approach the building. Overall it was a bad idea.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles encountered was the foundation of the buildings. "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure will have to be transmitted, nearly eleven hundred feet lower." It became an obstacle because the building had already been constructed, so it was necessary to bypass the existing foundations. Another obstacle that was encountered was a law. The law stated that "no airship is allowed to fly at low altitude over urban areas." It became an obstacle because they had to convince the government people that it was safe. Ultimately, the biggest obstacle was nature itself. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." This was an obstacle because the winds could get so strong that the attached airship could rip off the roof and injure people below. In conclusion, this is how the builders in the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, encountered many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building.

The task of allowing airships to dock on the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. The first to come into play was the support of the building. The load of the airship and the wind pressure would greatly reduce the stability of the vessel. Over sixty thousand dollars were spent on structural modifications of the building. Another problem was the airships themselves. Most airships coming from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg incident, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accident like this would be even more devastating in a densely populated area. After facing all of these obstacles, the idea of mooring airships atop the Empire State Building was scrapped for the safety of people.       

<START>

 

While building the mooring mast above the Empire State Building, it seemed that engineers looked past all of its flaws. Safety was probably one of the biggest issues for the mooring mast. It has been said that most airships outside of the United States use hydrogen or helium. Thus causing a higher risk of exploding. After the events of the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey, they were very scared of what would happen if it happened above downtown. Nature was considered his greatest obstacle. The winds at the top of the awalyses moved violently due to the drafts. The stern of the ships would pivot around and around the mooring mast @ CAPS1 was another major reason. Airships were not allowed to fly at a certain height over urban areas. It is even illegal to approach the area where the building was located. Al Smith really should have done more research into what could have gone wrong with his mooring mast.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many technical and safety issues when creating the mooring mast for the building's airship. First of all, an airship moored to the mast by a single cable would put a lot of stress on the building's frame. The building's frame first had to be reinforced to allow such a project. When the mast was finished, several other problems prevented its use. The mast was designed to make the building a center of travel, but most airships in other countries used hydrogen to fly, instead of helium. Earlier, the German airship Hindenburg had been destroyed because the hydrogen was so flammable. We realized that such a disaster would be much more catastrophic if it happened in a densely populated city like New York. In addition, airships moored to the mast would be blown away by high winds, possibly pushing them into neighboring buildings. The lead weights normally used to prevent this should have been left hanging over pedestrians, a major safety concern - @ CAPS1, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over built-up areas, making l use of the mast illegal. These problems doomed the mooring mast project from the start.        

<START>

 

The fact that these airships were so big and filled with hydrogen and helium that the tip at the top would have made it burst. In addition, the winds were always too strong that they could ever connect the airship to the building. Finally the fact that the German airship Hindenburg was burning like that they were afraid that it would happen. Especially in a crowded neighborhood like New York.   

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when they attempted to make a mooring mast for Airships. The first major problem they encountered was the construction itself. He said that " the stress of the load of airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundations of the buildings ." The building being the tallest in the world could not take the pressure. They could possibly make it strong but at a high cost for something so @ CAPS1 already. The architects then focused on safety in a heavily populated area like downtown New York. They found airships to be dangerous and out of control in a city of towers. The normal docking processes of an airship should accomplish the change to build up. the mooring mast, soon laws were given to keep airships away from populated areas after the Hindenburg incident. Yet some have still dared to try to tie up to the mast, like the Los Angeles and the Columbia, but the mast has never been put to good use and already shows the @ CAPS1 innovation issues like the Empire State Building .           

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock there. A big safety concern: Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was that when airships were docked in open airstrips, they could be ballasted at the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building would not work due to the high density. New York City's population and the fact that they were hanging over pedestrians. Another reason was the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area. Even if it did, there were concerns that the airship might be pierced by other obstacles on surrounding buildings.    

<START>

 

Architects and builders working on the construction of a mooring platform atop the Empire State Building for airships encountered many obstacles. The first problem the builders encountered was the possibility that the building's frame was not strong enough to support the weight of an airship. It said in paragraph nine that " the stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, and it was too risky." Another obstacle encountered by the builder 'was nature itself. @ CAPS1 some airships used hydrogen instead of helium, there was concern that the winds at the top of the building would be too strong and be destroyed by flammable gases. The next hurdle faced by builders was public safety. There was a law prohibiting the theft of airships that were too low over urban areas. Airships @ CAPS2 were unable to approach the wharf over the area for the sake of the citizens of New York. All of these issues eventually led to "the idea of using the mooring mast [to be] out of the way".       

<START>

 

After reading the excerpt, builders faced many obstacles while trying to dock airships to the top of the Empire State Building. First of all, the lack of a suitable landing zone. The builders knew they needed to add a mooring mast at the top so it could land safely and passengers could get on and off. Another problem they faced was placing a thousand-foot airship on top of the building, which would damage the building's framing. This pressure as well as the wind pressure should be converted up to the foundation of the buildings. Finally, the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents, allowing the stern of the ship to pivot around the mooring mast. Although this is a brilliant idea to improve transportation, this product never worked and was not thought out correctly.       

<START>

 

Based on the given snippet, the idea of allowing airships to land on a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in New York City was impractical. One obstacle that proves this point is that most airships are filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas rather than helium like a balloon. This poses security problems for the urban city. Another obstacle that kept this idea from being practical was that some laws were passed stating that airships and airships could only fly so low over urban areas due to high winds and the risk of destruction. The mooring mast was and is not practical for landing airships and is mainly useful for tourist attraction.    

<START>

 

The architects of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles while constructing the mooring mast. One of them would be that the purpose it was meant to serve (mooring airships) the original design of the building could not handle. In paragraph @ NUM1, it says "A thousand foot airship would add stress to the structure of the building." Because of this awareness, they had to make “ sixty thousand dollars in modifications ” (paragraph @ NUM1) Another obstacle they would have to face would be the addition of new floors. Originally they had designed the building to be around @ NUM3 stories high, but with the addition of the mooring mast the builders had to create an additional roof and do it in such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a loading dock. These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were soluble. Some of the obstacles that manufacturers faced were not fixable. The first was that @ LOCATION2's airships were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flammable). Due to the location of the Empire State Building (downtown New York), a small accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, thwy did not take into consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State Building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very strong winds. These winds would make the airships unstable, which was not certain either. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock.             

<START>

 

In the excerpt, the obstacles the Empire State Building @ CAPS1 faces in attempting to allow airships to dock, was the "lack of a suitable landing zone." (p. @ NUM1) @ CAPS1 was trying to attempt a suitable landing zone to allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers get on and off. @ CAPS1 is trying to try out an electric winch. It "swayed in the breeze and yet passengers could safely get on and off the airship by walking on a gangway to an open observation deck." The biggest obstacle, @ CAPS1 of the Empire State Building was to "naturer itself", which meant that airships would dock in open airstrips, where they would be well above pedestrians in the sky. street where it was neither practical nor safe. @ CAPS1 of the Empire State tried these causes to allow airships to enter Empire State Building property!

In this clip "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The safety of people was at stake, nature was also a big obstacle, the other reason was that the airships could not tie up to the Empire State Building because it was against the law. First of all, the obstacle of the builders, which they had completely forgotten, was the safety of people. Most airships outside @ LOCATION2 used hydrogen other than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. And they didn't want to risk someone getting hurt in a densely populated area. Also, another big hurdle was @ CAPS1 nature itself. Sometimes the winds were strong and he went back and forth. And if an airship was strapped, it would swing violently over the unsafe citizens. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships near urban areas, and New York City was very dense. And the reason for this law is that nothing bad happens to citizens. In conclusion, there were many obstacles that the builders had gone through, and they were blinded by the project and they wanted to do it, they forgot about safety.

There would have been many obstacles to allow an airship to dock atop the Empire State Building. It can become very densely populated with taller buildings.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, builders encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock with it. One of the biggest obstacles was security. They would need to find a way to tie the airships to the mast without causing them to sway in the wind. "Even though the airships were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship swivels around and around the mooring mast" (@ NUM1). Another obstacle to the attempt to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building was the mast design. “Architects couldn't just put a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building” (@ NUM2). The Empire State Building's steel frame had to be reinforced to withstand the weight of the mast.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the making of the mast. The first obstacle was that of the stability of the buildings. The excerpt specifies that " the steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced ". This shows that in order for the mast to be constructed, the structure of the entire building would have to be altered to accommodate the use of the mast. The second obstacle they faced, in actual use of the mast, was nature. In the hopes of mooring the airships to the mast, Mother Nature would not allow it, as @ CAPS1 says in the excerpt, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts." They also warned that with these drafts, passengers would not exit the airship safely due to the rapidly floating end of the airship undocked. They were concerned that if they moored the end it would be dangerous for pedestrians below, just like the helium in the airship would as well.

The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow the airships to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building, until they eventually stopped. According to the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Chrysler Building in New York City was about to be the pinnacle of the unbuilt Empire State. The weight and force of an airship could damage the entire building, so it would need to be reinforced and modified in order for the airship to land. Engineers also had to find a way to control the flammability of airships. In paragraph @ NUM1, Lüsted describes an airship that exploded in New Jersey not too long ago, and that building an airstrip over the densely populated city of New York could be detrimental. . The mooring mast builders eventually came to the conclusion that the plan was "neither practical nor safe" (@ NUM2). Airships are held in place with lead weights and it could have a negative effect on pedestrians if something were to go wrong. The builders of the Empire State building had a lot to think about when it came to building the airship dock, and in the end, it was for the best that they decided not to do it.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast", author Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains how the spire of the Empire State Building was originally intended for use as a mooring mast. This boom goal was never achieved due to the many issues and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Some of the biggest issues that manufacturers faced were unpredictable and high winds, the use of hydrogen in airships, and air laws. Winds were a problem because even if the front of the airship was attached to the mast, the rear of the airship could swing freely in the wind, which could cause it to crash into another moored airship. The winds would also make simply surrendering to the Empire dangerous work. The use of hydrogen was a problem because hydrogen is a volatile gas in the sense that it explodes, which would be very dangerous in a densely populated area. Finally, air laws were problematic because the United States has a law that prohibits airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would make docking at the Empire State Building illegal.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, drafts and existing laws, attempting to allow airships to dock with the vessel. The first hurdle that manufacturers encountered was the use of hydrogen in most airships outside of the United States. Hydrogen is considered highly flammable, a big safety concern. A German airship was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. "The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area like downtown New York." (@ NUM1) If this had happened in New York, the damage could have been much worse. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the strong drafts. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." (@ NUM1) it is very dangerous because of the pedestrians in the street. The final hurdle was an already existing law that prohibits airships from flying low over urban areas. "The law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to a vessel." (@ NUM3) this law would not allow the airship to approach New York. In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the owners of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as the use of hydrogen, drafts and existing laws in an attempt to authorize the airship dock on the building.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow the airships to dock there were that the stress of the load on the airships and the wind pressure could have caused problems with the foundations of the buildings. . A thousand-foot airship, held by a single tether cable. would add stress to the framework of buildings. Safety was another issue, most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. This is a problem because hydrogen is highly flammable. On May 6, 1937, the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. the accident would have been more dangerous in New York because the city is densely populated. Another reason they encountered problems allowing airships to dock is that there was a law prohibiting airships flying too close to urban areas. In December 1930, the airship @ ORGANIZATION2 attempted to reach the mooring mast but could not reach it due to the winds, fearing that it would blow the airship at the sharp arrows of other buildings. It would pierce the airship's hull.

Without a doubt, the builders of the mooring mast that was to rest on top of the Empire State Building were very innovative and ambitious. However, it is also clear that they faced many difficulties which they both overcame and through which they were overcome. A major difficulty they faced was that a thousand-foot-long airship attached to a 1,250-foot-tall building with extreme wind currents around the top would put a lot of stress on the building. the load of the airship and the wind it would have to transmit the pressure to the foundations of the building ... More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the building. @ CAPS1, the builders were on the verge of overcoming this problem. After construction, however, the mooring mast could not be fully utilized due to more challenges it faced. After the tragic accident of the Hindenburg, "the owners realized how point this accident could have been worse if it had happened over a densely populated area like downtown New York. ” Another concern was that with winds this strong and unable to tie up the before the direct eable to the moor, the stern would sway. "Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted at the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. " The final challenge facing the mooring mast was the pre-existing law against low-flying planes. It ended Al Smith's dreams.

Based on the excerpt, the obstacles encountered by the builder of the Empire State Building while attempting to allow airships to dock there. My prediction is that he doesn't want it because the Empire State Building is way too high and the airships are like floating right above it. Anything can have is what I think Al Smith is worried about. My back-up response is the statement he said "it's level, okay." No kidding. The government folks in Washington are looking for a safe way to tie airships to that mast, "it seems. let him be confused about the whole situation.

There were numerous obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The first hurdle they encountered was that some airships were @ NUM1 feet long, or four blocks in New York City. This was a hindrance as it added stress to the frame of buildings when it was attached with a single tie. To do this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be reinforced and modified. The next obstacle they faced was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. For example, in the snippet it says that the US Navy airship Los @ CAPS1 approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to moor due to high winds. Plus, the captain couldn't even take his hands off the lever. The next hurdle they faced was the issue of security. The builders said the airships were weighted with lead, but if they did, it would be a safety concern. This would be a safety concern since the airship would be suspended above pedestrians on the street. The last hurdle they faced was the law banning low-level flights over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the building or even approach the area.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock on its mooring mast. The first obstacle they had was the extreme winds. The winds were constantly changing, so the airships blew fiercely through the air. Another obstacle was that foreign airships used hydrogen, instead of helium, which is extremely flammable. The latest hurdle that manufacturers faced was the law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of reasons when they attempted to dock airships to the building's mast.

Many obstacles were encountered while attempting to dock the airships on the Empire State Building. Such as the danger of mooring non-American airships. The problem was, they used hydrogen instead of helium, which made them highly flammable. They thought about the moment the German airship crashed and realized how much worse it would be if it happened in downtown New York. Another problem is the force of nature's wind. The wind atop the Empire State Building was still turning aggressively. Also, using lead weights as they do when landing in fields would be dangerous for people below. Finally, the law was a problem. The law stated that it was illegal to fly this low over urban areas. Although two airships tried, they both experienced the dangers.

According to the expert, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and tried to allow the airships to dock there. Allowing an airship to land on top of the Empire State Building has never been considered an easy task. As it was mentioned in the article, the idea of the airship was " never intended to perform its functions ". One obstacle that manufacturers would face is safety. Since most airships outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. This is a very dangerous obstacle for builders because the fire itself is really dangerous. However, the biggest obstacle was nature itself. If the winds turn violently, airships could be well below and hang over pedestrians. It would not be safe for people or builders as it could harm them. Another hurdle that builders would face is that there was a law prohibiting aerial vessels from flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a vessel to dock or approach the area. This made it more difficult for the builders because it is against the law.

In "The Mooring Mast" by @ ORGANIZATION1, there were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. There were obstacles such as the fact that if an airship was attached to the building with only one tie, it would "add stress to the structure of the building." To solve the problem, more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the building. Another problem was that some airships used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, which would be very dangerous to have it in a densely populated area. The "biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". By this, Lüsted means that there are many strong air currents at the top of the building, which means that the ship would rotate endlessly. To ensure that this did not happen, lead weights should be used, which would be impractical and impractical to “ hang well over pedestrians ”. Ultimately, people realized that there were far too many issues with using a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.

To begin with, the builders of the Empire State Building had encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Many obstacles had been caused by the airship itself. For example, the airship was highly dangerous and flammable in the 1930s. "When the German airship was destroyed by fire, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. " Another obstacle that the builders had faced was nature itself. The winds were constantly changing due to strong air currents. It would be very dangerous for an airship to fly so close to a mooring mast with winds like this. Additionally, airships could not fly near the Empire State Building, due to a law in effect prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or approach the area. Al Smith's dream was to make the Empire State Building suitable for transportation, but sometimes dreams don't always flow.

Experts have encountered some major obstacles in the construction of the Empire State Building. One of those major hurdles was the frame. When you're going to build a 1,250-foot building and land an airplane there, you need a good, well-designed framework. What they did was add stainless steel and chrome-nickel windows to reduce the pressure. They spent over sixty thousand dollars to modify the skeleton of the Empire State Building. The other main problem was the drafts. You can't tie up an airship and believe the back of it is swinging and worth it. When you are almost 11 @ NUM1 ft in the air, the wind can be very strong at this height. If the airship became loose or unhooked before refueling was complete, the airship would crash and burn, hundreds of pedestrians on the ground below. Al Smith had a great idea but he didn't realize all the problems.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. They had to account for the stress of the building, and adding more to the top of the building would increase the stress. The steel frame should be modified and reinforced to meet the needs. In addition, it would represent more than @ MONEY1 'of modifications. Manufacturers have also faced the safety hurdle. Most airships used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is flammable, so it wouldn't be safe. "... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." There was also a law that was in their way. Faced with all these obstacles, the manufacturers did not follow up on this idea.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the main concerns was with the airships themselves, as they use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If an airship were to explode over a densely populated area, it would be catastrophic. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the building's mooring mast was nature. A mooring mast is used to moor airships such as an airship or a zeppelin. With these large aircraft, docking them at the top of a building where the winds are moving violently is very dangerous. the stern of the vessel would pivot around the mooring mast, posing as a threat @ CAPS1. Airships moored in open fields of land where they could be ballasted with lead weights. With an airship docked above the Empire State Building it would swing over pedestrians, this is neither @ CAPS2 nor practical. The construction of the Empire State Building presented @ CAPS3 with more challenges and obstacles than its architects expected.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered various issues with @ CAPS1 to allow airships to dock with it. The nature of the ships, the added stress on the building and safety were all against the ludicrous idea of landing airships on the Empire State Building. The nature of the ships would make the body sway in the wind. A resulting problem is entanglement of the mooring cable. To combat this, captains should use lead counterweights. These were very inconvenient to use as they hung over crowded streets. Another problem was added to the stress for the building foundation. Since the building was not usually designed for this role, modifications would have to be made to its foundation. The cost of these renovations was over sixty thousand dollars. The most obvious problem was security. These airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The area surrounding the building had other buildings with pointed spiers at the top.

According to the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in trying to allow airships to moor there. These obstacles include weather conditions, safety, the previous airship tragedy, and the law. The wind on top of the Empire State Building was a huge safety hazard because even if the airship was secure, the rear would sway causing potential danger due to the unpredictable winds. To pilot an airship they are filled with hydrogen instead of helium, it is also dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire at Lakehurst, @ LOCATION3, so the owners took into consideration that it could have been much worse if the crash had taken place over a densely populated area like New York. Airships are very dangerous, which created many obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow airships to dock there.    

<START>

 

The hurdles that the builders faced are airships flying too low in the area and making the Empire State Building taller than it should be. As in @ CAPS1, three Al Smiths realized he was in danger of losing his title as tallest building in the world. On December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State Building would reach a height of 1,250 feet. All he had to do was add a top or hat to the building and that would make it even taller than any other building in town. . Another obstacle they faced was a law on airships flying too low over urban areas. They made this law so that no airship would ever attach itself to a building. Flying too low is a huge safety hazard; it could cost the lives of hundreds of people.

In the snippet, there were many hurdles the builders faced when they allowed the airships to dock on the Empire State Building. The first consisted of reinforcing the steel frame of the building. The builders also had to make the Empire State Building 102 floors and make the 101st floor an observatory. The last obstacle encountered was the construction of the Empire State Building. These are the hurdles that builders faced when building the Empire State Building.

in Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was that a huge airship held the top of the building held by a single cable would have stressed the rest of the building. in order to make the tower half of the building more stable they would have to spend sixty thousand dollars on modifications @ CAPS1 nature was a key issue the winds were unpredictable due to the strong drafts and even though the airships were attached to the mast the the back would pivot around @ CAPS2 the large airships hanging over pedestrians were not safe. Another reason that airships could not be docked atop the Empire State Building was that there was a law prohibiting airships from flying so low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal to tie up ships there. all in all, these are some of the hurdles encountered during the construction of the Empire State Building    

<START>

 

From "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State Building had to be much more. The dangers of gas in some airships were a huge risk because some were flammable. Having the mooring mast in the huge city was also a potential threat to the safety of the city and the people. So is the security threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high that it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds. With the winds, the airships couldn't stay in one spot, which was another safety issue the architects overlooked. After all the safety issues and weather issues, there was the fact that a law forbade the idea. Make the idea of a mast out of the question. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they should have done, the mast was never built, and it's very unfortunate that after all the planning, there is absolutely no way the airships could land on it. .

In Marcia Amidon @ ORGANIZATION2's excerpt “ The Mooring Mast ”, the architects had to face many reasons in trying to allow airships to moor there. Architects could not put a mooring mast at the start as it would add stress to the framing of the buildings. The architects had to modify and reinforce the steel frame of the building to accomplish the new situation they are making. Before placing the mooring mast, the architects designed a tower in shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel to match the general shape of the building. Even before the mooring mast was built above the building, the roof had to be completed. when setting up the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building ; it did not work. When they tested it, the airship did not come close enough to attach it. So in the future, "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2 did not work.

The builders of the Empire State Building had big plans to allow airships, also known as airships, to dock there. Although they kept their expectations high, they faced many obstacles while trying to get there. The first problem they encountered was that the steel frame of the building had to be reinforced due to the stress of the load on the airship. The architects therefore had to make modifications to the structure of the building. Safety was also an issue as hydrogen made airships flammable, which could lead to destruction by fire. There was also a law stating that “ airships cannot fly at low altitude over urban areas ”. @ CAPS1, airships would not be allowed to attach to the building, let alone reach this area. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." Due to the strong winds, the airships swiveled too much and the area was not open enough to weigh down the back with lead weights. Thus, the architects of the Empire State Building faced too many obstacles in attempting to allow the airships to dock there successfully.           

<START>

 

When the Empire State Building was designed at @ NUM1, it was intended to be the tallest building. However, not many people know that the mast's original purpose was to serve as a landing point for airships, also known as airships. In @ DATE1, airships were hailed as the transport of the future. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top to moor these new airships. However, in trying to do so, the builders encountered many obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. Some of these airships were up to a thousand feet long, and that's where the first hurdle they faced came in. Since the airships were so long, the first hurdle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Plus, architects couldn't just drop a docking mask on the roof of the Empire State Building. That plus a @ NUM2ft airship moored at the top, we had insisted on the frame of the building. This would be another obstacle encountered by workers. The mooring mask was intended never to fulfill its function, for the safety of many people. This was yet another obstacle that workers faced. The final obstacle, and the practical reason why airships could not dock with the building, was an existing law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas. These are the many obstacles that builders faced when trying to dock airships to the Empire State Building.             

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. The winds were "constantly changing due to strong air currents". It made it dangerous for an airship to stop there. Another obstacle was a law banning airships flying over cities. The law made it “illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area”. Since they were prohibited from doing this, no pilot would ever be there again. A third obstacle was the declining use of airships. With the Hindenburg incident on May 6, 1937 and the increasing use of airplanes, there were not many people on the airships. In conclusion, several obstacles prevented the airships from docking to the Empire State Building.          

<START>

 

In attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. In order for airships to anchor there, a mooring mast must be added. The architects then had to find a way to add "a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building" without adding stress to the building's frame. “The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself”. The architects knew they couldn't control the weather, and that worried them. Another obstacle that manufacturers faced was the "law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas". If the airships could reach the building, something could go wrong. The builders "feared that the wind would blow the airship on the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area." The obstacles encountered by the manufacturers quickly became unnecessary when "the idea of using the mooring mast for airships and their passengers discreetly disappeared".        

<START>

 

Trying to build a functional mooring dock for airships on the Empire State Building, the work became a difficult task. They first had to make changes worth sixty thousand dollars so that the building could withstand the weight and additional wind pressure of a moored airship. In addition, a pre-existing law prevented airships from descending as low in the city as they had to be to dock. Finally, the constant changes in the wind flow and other weather conditions made it almost impossible to secure a mooring to the Empire State Building, as the airship could be thrown into the pointed roofs of neighboring buildings and instead of being weighed down by lead as they would when they landed in the fields as they normally would, they would be strapped in, suspended over pedestrians.   

<START>

 

The obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building were not understood until late. They needed to find a way to go about it first, but they also needed government officials to agree that this is a safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat so they had to make something else for it to land. But the cable-held airship "would add stress to the structure of the building" and be sent to its foundations, meaning they would have to change their model of what the Empire State Building was going to be. But one of the worst hurdles manufacturers faced was the fact that airships are highly flammable. And there are a lot of people and other buildings in @ CAPS1 that could be endangered. Additionally, the weather has an impact on how airships will perform in the air, if the weather is bad it could cause major safety issues. There was and has been a law prohibiting airships from "flying too low over urban areas." @ CAPS2 a lot, this idea was over from the start, but no one took the time to realize it.        

<START>

 

The @ CAPS1 of Them Empire State Building obstacles were big problems which led to problems. for @ CAPS2, a landing zone for the airship was missing. But the reason for @ CAPS3 was the lack of security as this dream could not be fulfilled.

According to the excerpt, the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there are as follows. The first challenge was to find " a practical and workable arrangement " for engineers to work properly and safely. Another problem that builders faced was how to install a "thousand foot moored airship" in a building 1,046 feet high. The main obstacle they faced was that the moored airship would " add stress to the frame of the building " which could cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to rise to the challenge, they would have to modify and strengthen the "steel frame of the Empire State Building". @ CAPS1, the builders went through a lot of hurdles to get the airships to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was worth their hard work for Al Smith to retain his winning title.

When attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. At the time, there was a law prohibiting planes from flying at low altitudes over cities. In paragraph @ NUM1, the narrator says: "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even to approach the area". That didn't stop some airships from trying it out, but it was too dangerous around other buildings. The next hurdle concerned security. From the excerpt, "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." An incident like this with the Hindenburgs over a city like New York would be devastating. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suitable for holding an airship. The narrator specifies: "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." There was no practical way to hold the back of the airship. In light of all these issues, builders were forced to admit that the Empire State Building's mooring mast was indeed doomed.

In the excerpt titled "The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted on pages 1, @ NUM1, @ NUM2, @ NUM3. She basically explains the obstacles of the Empire State Building builders and how he coped in attempting to allow to airships Examples are on page 1.

While airships were invented in the early 1930s, many financial workers and men and women encountered problems when they tried to dock airships. An airship was an active propeller that passengers who boarded the airship could ride. It was a closed compartment under the ball. Let us return to the point of these inventions. Airships were a dangerous device according to the passage. From outside the United States, they used hydrogen, not helium. The reason for using hydrogen is that it is highly flammable. The German airship ... named Hindenburg, exploded in a fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Airships were a very dangerous device that was used in the 1930s. So, in the late 1930s, the idea of winged transport airships faded. Later, they took the passenger luggage of the airship and made it the largest soda fountain and tea garden in the world.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow airships to dock there were safety, nature itself, and the law. Safety as the airships used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable and an accident could occur as the "German airship Hindenburg" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. "Nature being the second problem, as strong air currents could move the airship and cause damage and injury to pedestrians. The law being the last reason, as there was a law prohibiting aerial vessels from flying too low at the top. over urban areas The statement in the excerpt says "This law would make it illegal for ships to tie up to the vessel. "Which makes it quite pointless even to have built it in the first place.

In this clip from @ ORGANIZATION2's "The Mooring Mast", we learn how the spire on top of the Empire State Building was actually meant to be a landing point for airships. However, there could never be an airship dock, for various reasons. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to tie up to the mooring mast. First, they couldn't because they were mostly made up of hydrogen, which is very flammable. This is all the more important given that the airship could eventually catch fire in New York. Then there was the problem of the winds. The wind at the top of the mast is extremely strong and the rear of the airship would constantly sway. Using lead weights to hold it down was one possibility, "but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be hung over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe." The last problem, and perhaps the most obvious, is that there was a law that prohibited airships, like airships, from flying too low over densely populated areas. Therefore, it "would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area." @ CAPS1 this excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" by @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, although they should have seen them coming, trying to tie the airships to the mast.

Construction always has challenges. In the excerpt from The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building face many challenges when trying to land airships there. Some of the hurdles faced by builders included the enormous size of the airships, the frame would have to be changed, the cost, and the nature itself. Landing the airships would be a difficult task. On the one hand, airships are huge, they are flying devices "a thousand feet" long. This would make landing extremely difficult due to its weight. The stress of airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. effort and planning. In addition, the modification also raises the problem of cost. It would take "over sixty thousand dollars in modifications." a barrier. The winds at the top of the building were "constantly changing due to strong drafts". to allow airships to dock there.

The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, talks about the height of the buildings, the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. The architecture that built the Chrysler Building was secretly hiding something. The secret was that he built a 185ft spire inside the building, shocked many people and the media by hoisting it to the top of the Chrysler Building. Now it's a height of 1,046 feet, which is 46 feet taller than the height of the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles to their increased use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Al Smith believed that a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service to let passengers get on and off. The mooring mast couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top or on the building. Adding a mooring mast to a cable tie could add stress to the framing of buildings. They finally build the mooring mast and hoist the American flag again.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several problems in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Safety was an issue for the builders. Airships made outside of the United States were used with hydrogen. It has become a safety issue because "hydrogen is highly flammable". At the top of the building, the wind is still turning because of "violent drafts". Changing winds would be a problem as they would rotate the end of the vessel around and around the mooring mast. Another problem that manufacturers faced was the "Law against Airships Flying Too Low in Urban Areas"; making the mooring of airships illegal. Builders also feared the high winds would " blow the airship at the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area, " putting the city at risk. The builders faced many obstacles that made it impossible to dock the airships atop the Empire State Building.

Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to dock the airships there include wind, weather, and most importantly, safety concerns. The excerpt states that " the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts ." This indicates that nature was a big obstacle to the plane of airships docked at the Empire State Building. The other major obstacle was security. The snippet reads: "Most airships from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." Another major safety concern was that using lead weights to anchor the airship was neither practical nor safe above the city of pedestrians.       

<START>

 

Allowing airships to dock with the Empire State Building has never been a good idea. "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent prior to its construction." Obstacles @ CAPS1 appeared once the idea was launched. Builders soon realized that docking airships to the Empire State Building would stress the building ; "Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame." Safety was a major obstacle as airships outside @ PERSON1 used highly flammable hydrogen. Then the obstacle of the wind came and played. Usually they weighed them down, but it wasn't ideal to be so close to other buildings and hover over thousands of people. "The other practical reason why airships couldn't fit over the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." The idea was never successful due to the obstacles presented.

Some obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were the law and the arrows that were on other buildings. Another problem was the manufacture of the mooring mast. this was a problem as it added a lot of stress to the building, and security was an issue. I said the law limited that because you can't put an airship over urban areas because if something goes wrong a lot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was not an easy task, it was very difficult to do it to support an airship as there will be too much pressure on the building. finally security there were airships which caught fire because of the gases with which they were working. If that happened in New York City, many innocent lives would have been gone.

The builders faced many different hurdles in their attempt to get the Blimps to dock there. There were two major obstacles. “The main reason was safety : most airships outside of the US used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly @ CAPS1” (@ NUM1). If an airship had an accident like the Hindenburg, not only would the Empire State Building collapse but it would also affect other buildings and people due to the population of the city. Finally, the other big effect on the building was the weather. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts" (@ NUM2). The winds could easily have knocked her down with an airship attached to it for this reason: "the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast" (@ NUM2). As a result, the airship would be so close to the mast that if a strong enough wind was blowing, the airship would weigh down on the mast. All in all, all weather and hydrogen powered airships with the two major hurdles from manufacturers.

Al Smith's plan to add two hundred and fifty feet in height to the Empire State Building by securing a staging area for mobile airships was plausible in theory, but when implemented, workers had to contend to multiple obstacles which ultimately made the attempt unsuccessful. . The simplest obstacle and the only repairable was the problem of the additional stress that the airship put on the frame of the building. The whole building had to be reinforced to accommodate the pressure, but the workers eventually finished construction. However, the biggest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds so high in the air were constantly moving violently, so even if the airship had been strapped to the mast, the rear of the mast would pivot uncontrollably. Unfortunately, because they would have landed high in the air, using lead weights, control of the rear of the aircraft was impractical. The prevention of problems of nature is not possible, and likewise nothing could have been done to solve the problem of insecurity. Most of the airships outside @ LOCATION2 used more flammable gas inside, and landing an airship that could catch fire over New York was an extremely dangerous idea. There was nothing the workers could have done to resolve the makeup of airships in other countries. Finally, at the very least, there were strong laws that made it illegal to have something this low in the urban area. Obviously, this obstacle could not have been overcome without years of waiting and many legal steps. Placing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building with the hope of landing airships seemed good, but in the actual process there were a lot of obstacles presented, most of which had no solution. In the end, the hope of "equipping [the building] for an era of transport" had to be abandoned.

The problems that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were safety concerns. As noted in paragraph @ NUM1, the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock with it would be such things as the different use of air. One sentence I found to follow this reason would be in paragraph @ NUM1 when it says, "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. " That would pose many problems and encounter many obstacles. Another reasoning I found was the wind. One reason I found would be the one given in paragraph @ NUM2, "The stress of the load of airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." It would be something difficult to resolve. Like other barriers that I have found such as size and density, I find these two to be the best reasoning.

The hurdles the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than gasoline. helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. The Empire State Building's metal framework should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation. When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been had it taken place over a densely populated area, for example the downtown area. New York City. The biggest obstacle was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts. Even though the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship pivoted around and around the mooring mast. Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted at the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe.

According to the snippet, there were a few main hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was that architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. This would add unwanted stresses to the frame of the building. Another problem was the gas used to fill the airships. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, could cause a dangerous fire over a densley populated area in downtown New York. Towards the top of the building, strong drafts caused another problem. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mast. A final problem was an existing law that prohibited airships from flying low over urban areas, such as New York.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems in trying to make airships capable of docking there. One problem was that airships used hydrogen instead of helium to fly. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." The airships could not be used because they represented a major safety problem for the people transported. Another obstacle was that the drafts were very strong at the top of the Empire State Building. "Even if the airship was attached to the requested mooring, the stern of the ship swivels around and around the mooring mast." Airships are usually set down in open fields, the rear ends being able to be set down with lead weights ; airships suspended above pedestrians were neither practical nor safe.

In @ ORGANIZATION2's @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 "The Mooring MASt" from @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allow airships to dock there.

In conclusion, I showed the obstacles that the builders faced on @ ORGANIZATION1.

Marcia Amidon Lüsted's Mooring Mast describes issues the Empire State Building builders faced, such as the amount of stress the airships would add to the building's frame. safety concerns and laws; and winds around the mast. Any airship would add tremendous stress to the building's already constructed frame and builders had to make "over sixty thousand dollars in alterations." These changes were quickly made, but safety concerns such as a potential fire or "flying too low over urban areas", (which was in fact illegal), still prevailed. The "biggest obstacle" to the mast construction was the high winds that surrounded the Empire State Building. These winds were "constantly changing", making it virtually impossible to stay in one place without rotating around the building. In a city as densely populated as New York, it was not even possible to weigh the airships down for landing. This list of obstacles is a clear sign that the mooring mast was not properly thought out before the start of the work. The builders should have focused more on what they had done instead of trying to exceed everyone's expectations and do something like "a higher calling".        

<START>

 

Builders faced many obstacles to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building. The first was the stress that would be put on the entire building if an airship was attached to a mast at the top. “ The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. » (@ NUM1) This problem was easily solved by reinforcing the frame of the building. Another major problem was the wind 1250 feet in the air, the wind blowing very hard and violently. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." (@ NUM2) The wind combined with the fact that an airship was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hydrogen is a very combustible gas and if an airship entered the building and there was a spark, the entire mass of the ship would be set alight.         

<START>

 

The obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock with it were the height of the building. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1, it is stated that "the steel frame of the building should be modified, more than six thousand dollars of modifications". This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Also, because the building is so tall that the mast is not that stable so this was the main obstacle shown in paragraph @ NUM2 "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts ". This demonstrates that the mast in these currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. Finally, even state laws have become an obstacle for airships, as in paragraph @ NUM3, it is stated that "this law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the vessel". This justifies that this was also an obstacle that manufacturers faced.   

<START>

 

The obstacles that the manufacturers had to face were very big obstacles. One of them being the mooring mast itself. The building that was not strong enough to hold an airship with its original design. The building therefore had to be modified and reinforced to adapt to this situation. They would add a rocket-shaped tower constructed of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. This tower would illuminate from the inside. Which would increase the building from @ NUM1 floors to 102 floors. I got all of this information from paragraphs @ NUM2.

Based on the snippet, some obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there included the @ CAPS1 laws, the fact that some airships used hydrogen instead. helium, and finally at such great heights the strong wind currents were also a problem. The restriction on the height of the planes was that the plaes could not fly over cities without posing a safety hazard. "An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." (THE MOORING MAST). Another obstacle was that some airships outside of the United States used hydrogen as fuel instead of helium, which could be a problem since hydrogen is highly flammable. "From outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium." (The mooring mast). Finally, the strong winds were also an obstacle, the strong wind currents blew the airships all around as the attempt to dock at the Empire State Building would be problematic. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents." (The mooring mast). In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock there.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles to allow airships to dock. One was the weight. The architects couldn't just place the mooring mast or it would precipitate the building. So they had to add over sixty thousand dollars into the frame. Another problem was the security concerns. Other countries have used hydrogen as an airship gas. As the hydrogen was highly flammable, it was dangerous to catch fire over New York City. Another problem was the severe weather at the top of the building. The airships would sway aft due to bad weather, so it would be extremely dangerous for them to get passengers on and off. There is also a law in New York that prohibits low-flying vehicles, so airships could not dock them in the first place.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to allow airships to dock there. The challenges ranged from nature itself to the laws against it. They didn't take into consideration the constantly changing air at the top of the building. At heights such as the mast mast, strong air currents would cause the airship to rotate around the mooring mast. This was also due to the fact that the airship would only be attached to the front. Not only did these big factors come into play, but laws also prevented airships from docking with the Empire State. They did not think about the existing law. He said planes flying at low altitudes or over urban areas were against the law. So many factors went into the construction of such a project. Overall, it was too far-fetched an idea.         

<START>

 

There were a few obstacles to making this idea work. one of the obstacles was to make the mast and frame of the building strong enough to support an airship swaying in the wind. There was more than @ MONEY1 spent on building modification. In addition, they had to add a few floors to the building for a total of 102 floors.

According to the excerpt " The Mooring Mast " by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the main reasons would be the airship's safety issues. Most airships used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas which could easily ignite, just like Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg one happened over downtown New York, the result would not be good. Also airships moored in open fields and should be anchored with heavy lead weights. These weights would not be practical or safe to hang over people and early morning on top of a building is not an open field. A final hurdle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for docking airships. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of a building held together by a single tether cable would add stress to the structure of the building." Without a doubt, simply docking airships atop the tallest building in the world would lead to many different hurdles that builders would face.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few attempts at obstructions to allow the airship to dock there. First of all, the Empire State Building was destined never to fulfill its function because the builders had not noticed all the problems it had. One attempt was the Goodyear Columbia Airship, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building as reported in paragraph @ NUM1. In paragraph @ NUM2 it is stated that the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The builders had a lot of work to do trying to fix the issues, but there was just too much of it. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face a few attempts at obstacles to allow the airship to dock there.

Despite the costly investments of sixty thousand dollars that had to be put into the building for this project to become a reality, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many other hurdles in trying to allow the airships to go. moor there. The biggest obstacle they faced was the safety of people; an airship suspended nearly @ NUM1 feet above the ground with the possibility of an explosion and pedestrians below doesn't seem like the smartest idea. Another problem they faced was the strain that the airship, held by a single cable, would place on the building's frame. With the wind blowing, the airship around the load and pressure should be sent up to the base of the building about @ NUM1 feet deep. For this to work, builders would need to reinforce the building's steel frame. Perhaps the most difficult obstacle they faced was nature itself, strong winds above the building would have caused the airship to rotate when docked, as well as the risk of being blown of course and in another building. And if they wanted this idea to work in the first place, they should have checked the laws first; planes were not allowed to fly so low over urban areas. The builders of this landing pier and the Empire State Building encountered too many obstacles.         

<START>

 

According to the excerpt, the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow the airships to dock there were mainly due to the dangers of high winds at an altitude such that the plane can s' crush either against the building or down to the ground. For example, two airships attempted to dock and one of them was unable to approach the building because of the winds. The other was able to deliver a bundle of newspapers hoisted by a rope. In conclusion, the main problem was the instability of the aircraft at the dock.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when attempting to dock airships to it. One of the hurdles they faced was safety, as the airships were filled with hydrogen. "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (¶ @ NUM1). If the airship caught fire in New York, a lot of people would die. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds were strong at the top of the building. "Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast" (¶ @ NUM2). It would have been very dangerous. A third obstacle was the law, which it was impossible to circumvent. There was "a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas" (¶ @ NUM3). Although this was broken twice, it was still illegal to dock airships at this low height. Because of all these obstacles, the idea of docking airships to the Empire State Building was scrapped.

the empire state building builder ran into some hurdles while trying to allow airships to dock there because they had to plan what they would need to dock there. What kinds of materials would be needed in this project and how it would work. Before you put everything together.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems with airships. One problem is that there was no easy way to create such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while still making it look good. The other biggest reason / issue with the mast for mooring airships was just a safety issue. But a big one. Most airships used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. So, if something should go wrong while docking, the airship could catch fire, explode and fall in a densely populated area. There were a lot of safety and structural issues, but they were eventually resolved (like the fact that heavy lead weights had to hang over the streets to make the rear of the airship heavier.

While trying to get the airships to dock on the Empire State Building, @ CAPS1 had to face many obstacles. Many of the obstacles were simple and not signed by @ CAPS1 for example on page three @ CAPS2 @ NUM1 and @ NUM2 and it says it was "dangerous because the airships were filled with hydrogen" which is highly flammable . there was @ CAPS3 in the @ CAPS4 because of them being flammable, the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. there were also strong drafts and a law prohibiting planes flying too low over urban areas

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles and attempted to allow the airships to dock there. The first problem encountered was that "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." This was a problem because if the airship caught fire or exploded over a densely populated city like New York, many people could be injured or killed. The second problem that the builders had to face was that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts". These winds would cause the airship to rotate, even attached to the mooring mast, making boarding impossible. It would also be dangerous for anyone on board the airship. The third problem was that there was "... a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas." Since New York City is certainly an urban area, this law prevented even airships from approaching the Empire State Building to moor. Overall, the builders encountered a lot of obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building. For these reasons, the Empire State Building has never been an effective place to moor airships.         

<START>

 

Trying to build the Empire State Building in a way that allowed airships to dock at the top of the building posed many challenges for builders. There was a huge safety issue in having the airships so close to town. In paragraph @ NUM1, fear of the winds that could blow the airship into other buildings, destroying them, scared people. The second concern was that the airship is full of highly flammable gas and if it were to ever ignite over a city, a lot of damage would be done to the airship and to New York City. The last major concern is found in paragraph nine. The problem would be how much stress the building would endure having an airship strapped to the top of it. The whole building should be rebuilt to help the Empire State Building not withstand this stress ; In fact, virtually every part of the building and the airship would need to be renovated in order to protect New York City and the airship's passengers.

One of the obstacles encountered by the builder was nature itself. The @ CAPS1 states "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts."

The builders of the Empire State Building had a few hurdles to overcome when they attempted to allow airships to dock there, as Marcia Amidon Lüsted writes in The Mooring Mast. Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, didn't want his masterpiece to be just for show, so he gave it a purpose; a dock for airships. By adding a comma " a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable ", the building's frame would be subjected to many stresses ; ultimately making the structure unsafe. To change the setting and the wind pressure, more than @ MONEY1 would have to be accumulated. If an accident were to occur, such as in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated city would be in grave danger. While these obstacles can be overcome, the obstacle of Mother Nature itself cannot.          

<START>

 

As the idea of an airship dock was quite far-fetched, the first problem encountered was that having a thousand-foot-long airship attached to the empire state building would strain the structure of buildings, @ CAPS1 they should change the structure of the whole building to strengthen the frame. The biggest problem was a question of security. Airships use hydrogen which is extremely flammable. The author also states that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong air currents", which makes the idea of an airship dock extremely risky. They should have been spotted before so much money was invested in building this wharf.   

<START>

 

Builders encountered multiple obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building. One obstacle was that the airship would add too much stress to the frame of the building if it landed on it. The building is expected to be modified and cost over sixty thousand dollars more. Another obstacle encountered was the gas inside the airship. Some have used hydrogen which is extremely flammable. As New York is very populated, if something were to go wrong, it would be dangerous. Also, the winds at the top of the building were very strong. The stern of the airship would "pivot around the mooring mast." The final obstacle would be that it is “illegal for a ship to moor or approach a vessel”. The attempt to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building failed. There were too many obstacles.        

<START>

 

In "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire @ CAPS2 building faced many obstacles to allow airships to dock there. For @ CAPS3, the author said that "the stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This shows that not only did they have to be designed to support the load of the building, but Also, the author said, " A thousand-foot airship moored to the top by a single tether cable. Engineers should think of a way to safely moor the airship without anyone being injured. All of them. the engineers who designed the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles to allow airships to dock there.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. For example, "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." The builders could not simply "lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." Builders now had to find a way to add this airship mooring mast without putting too much pressure on the building. In addition, “the metal frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation. They now had to add "over sixty thousand dollars" in alterations to the building. In conclusion, "the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a recessed design that mimicked the general shape of the building itself." @ CAPS1 the architects have done a lot of work not only to make the airship mooring mast successful, but also beautiful. The excerpt "The Mooring Mast", @ ORGANIZATION2 shows the many obstacles encountered by architects in attempting to allow airships to dock there.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced several hurdles in their attempts to allow airships to dock there. The main obstacle for the builders was the wind currents that airships had to contend with when trying to moor nearly eleven hundred feet in the air. The strong winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the drafts. The US Navy Los Angeles airship couldn't even get close enough to attach to the mast. “The captain couldn't even take his hands off the control levers” (Lüsted @ NUM1) for fear that the outer hull would be punctured by the mast. In addition, if an airship was attached to the mast, it would move all around the mast depending on the unpredictable air currents. However, safety was also a major factor. “Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable” @ NUM2). Therefore, attempting to attach airships to the mast of the Empire State Building was very dangerous, as the obstacles that the builders faced were just too difficult to overcome.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships, also known as airships, to dock there. The initial problem was that the airship could not land on a flat surface. The builders therefore manufactured a "mooring mast" so that the airships could be connected by electric winch to the building. But it also caused problems. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast over the building or it would be unstable. But most importantly, since the winds kept changing, he would never stand still. The problem of foreign airships using hydrogen rather than helium made it dangerous to the public. In Conclusion The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to let the airships dock.

There were obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the many obstacles that airships faced was the lack of a proper landing zone, which I found in paragraph six. Another obstacle would be in paragraph @ NUM1 where it says "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." Nature itself would be another obstacle for airships, as "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong air currents." @ CAPS1 but not least, there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. Which means it is illegal for a vessel to tie up to the building or even approach the area. In conclusion, here are some of the many obstacles that an airship had to face.      

<START>

 

the builders of the Empire State Building bit more than they could chew when building a mooring mast there. The first of several issues was that the presence of a thousand foot long airship would put enormous strain on the building's framing, and @ MONEY1 modifications would have to be added. Security was another pressing issue. In 1937, the Hindenburg crash made building owners realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed into the densely populated city of New York. Not only was there a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. the nature factor made the Idea mooring mast completely @ CAPS1. The winds at the top of the building are always changing due to the strong air currents, even the captain of the US Navy ship Los Angeles was unable to land the airship. At this point, it was obvious that the mooring mast idea would not work. And airships were abandoned when planes, the method of aviation of the future, arrived.        

<START>

 

While trying to get airships to dock atop the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. The first obstacle was to modify the structure of the building to adapt to the constraints that the mooring mast would exert on the building. The load of the airship and the pressure of the wind had to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below. More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to modify the structure of the building. It was costly. Another hurdle that manufacturers face was the gas used inside the airship, hydrogen. Most airships outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if an airship were to catch fire over such a densely populated area as downtown New York, the results of the crash would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts. The airship would pivot around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in the open airstrips, it was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Importantly, an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal even for an airship to approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impossible to dock an airship on the Empire State Building's mooring mast.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. Hydrogen in airships was highly flammable, winds changed a lot, and current laws prohibited docking in such an area. Most airships during this time. Floated by hydrogen rather than helium. Manufacturers have discovered that hydrogen is highly flammable and too risky to land airships that could catch fire over an entire city. The excerpt also explained that nature was a huge problem. Air currents as high as those at the top of buildings were vicious and moved quickly, making suspended airships very risky. Finally, was the obstacle of breaking the law! The law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas. With all these obstacles which would be too difficult for the manufacturers to face, this unreal dream would nevertheless remain a dream.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems when trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was to design the building to be able to withstand the stress of a thousand-foot airship swinging around it in the wind. Builders had to find a way to distribute the wind pressure up to the foundation. Another problem was the strong winds that surrounded the building; when the navy tried to dock an airship on it it kept getting rocked by the strong winds, this problem was never solved. A third problem was to find a way to moor the airship, this was quickly solved with a winch. A final issue was the fact that airships were so dangerous and couldn't dock safely, as well as a law that prevented airships from flying near buildings, which was created for this reason.      

<START>

 

During this period, airships were considered the means of transportation of the future, and everyone thought it plausible. There were issues, however, that no one saw through. For example, airships were considered the next big innovation in transportation, but there was no supporting evidence. They devoted all of their time, effort and resources to building something for a purpose that never worked. Other issues were also overlooked, such as the wind speed at this height, and even if they could get close enough to the mast they would need someone to stand high up and tie it down, which would be too hard for a person. As the excerpt shows, Al Smith and his architects threw themselves into this problem too quickly and with insufficient information.     

<START>

 

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast, two architects play "battleship" with each of their airships, competing for the most height. However, when building these "huge steel structure balloons", the architects failed to realize the obstacles they would face in the process. The main reason was the security measures. Since most airships were made of hydrogen, they were highly flammable. This, they said, could have been worse than the German Hindenburg, which was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the best obstacle to using the mast was nature. The winds smacked the masts above the human beings, which was neither practical nor safe.     

<START>

 

In their quest to allow airships to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building encountered many challenges. One of the most obvious problems was that of the makeup of the airships themselves. At the time, they consisted of hydrogen which, although allowing a lower density, was highly flammable. This concept was proven and brought to light by the crash of the "Hindenburg", a famous airship in 1937. If an airship caught fire while docked with the Empire State Building, it would surely crash into civilians below. Another topic of debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated altitude of 1,250 feet from the mooring mast. Such winds could easily cause a lack of stability for an airship, which in turn could put additional pressure on the vessel itself. Another problem caused by the winds is that the airship could crash into other buildings, puncturing the fabric containing the hydrogen gas and crashing the airship. In the end, it was a project deemed too risky to continue.        

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. The first major problem was that they weren't sure the structure of the building could withstand a rocking airship. As said in paragraph @ NUM1. The builders also knew that since the airship would be hooked to the mast by a single cable, the air currents would rotate the stern of the ship around the mooring mast. As said in paragraph @ NUM2. There was also law enforcement against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel. These are some of the obstacles that manufacturers have faced

The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest building in the world. Al Smith's plans were to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building, but when a @ NUM1 feet high spire was added to the top, the Empire State Building would come in second. To overcome this first obstacle in the construction of the tower, Smith decided to change the idea of the tower and add his own spire: a mooring mast for airships. Using the tower as an anchor point for airships or zeppelins, Smith added an additional 250 feet to the tower. But to continue the plan, Smith had to face the obstacle of supporting an airship floating more than @ NUM2 feet above the ground. Smith had the entire building structure modified and reinforced before the building was completed. Smith's last obstacle was one he couldn't control: the weather. The winds at the top of the building were too strong, so the idea of the airship was scrapped, but Al Smith's tower had reached the tallest building in the world.

Throughout the construction process, the Empire State Building contractors encountered a few obstacles in their quest to moor airships to it. First of all, safety was a big factor in the quest. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been had it taken place in over a densely populated area like downtown New York. " @ CAPS1 a balloon and an airship can look the same, both are completely structured differently. Helium makes a balloon go up, an airship uses hydrogen to fly which is very flammable. Second, a law had already entered into force for air traffic. "... could not get close enough to attach due to the high winds. Lest the wind blow the airships at the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area, piercing the hull. " If the airship were to be punctured, it could collapse in the streets of New York, causing massive destruction. Thus completing some of the many obstacles in the way of the airships landing on the Empire State Building.

The Emir State building faced many obstacles and challenges during its construction. The builders built a mast in the shape of a rocket so that the airship could be housed in the well itself. Which also had elevators so people could go down to the lobby. The building would now have 102 floors. The glass-enclosed observation room would be on the 101st floor.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle they faced was around security. Many airships coming from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if it were to catch fire in New York, the results could be horrific. Another obstacle encountered by builders concerned nature. Due to the height of the Empire State Building, the wind has become a major factor. Wind currents were constantly changing and if an airship was attached to it, it would be dangerous. The stress of the wind pressure and the load of the airship should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. This meant that the frame of the building had to be reinforced. Another obstacle concerned the law. There is a law that states that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to tie a ship to the Empire State Building. The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there.

The mooring mast seems like a great idea. A landing dock for airships would have made a leap in the future. In the end, however, architect Al Smith bit more than he could chew. First of all, the fate of the Hindenburg worried the owners. "The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident (Hindenburg) could have been had it taken place over a densely populated area like downtown New York." The second problem is that there is a law prohibiting airships that fly too low in urban areas. As stated in paragraph @ NUM1, "This law would make it illegal for the vessel to tie up to the building or even approach the area", The last and most problematic part of the mooring mast actually turned out to be to be nature itself. It turned out that the wind at the top of the building was too strong and unpredictable. Even if the airship were attached, "the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." Overall, it looks like it was a great idea gone wrong.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building hoped to make the building a dock for airships but encountered several obstacles. From paragraph @ NUM1, the mast suction on the Empire State Building made the plan look well-crafted and it would soon become a reality. As the project progressed, many details were considered and when the airships were ready for action, the plan was not something practicable. Stated in paragraph @ NUM2, safety was a major concern for airships manufactured outside of the United States, as they contained flammable hydrogen gas. This is a problem because of the fear of an accident occurring in a densely populated area. Another obstacle that airships encountered when trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself as presented in paragraph @ NUM3. The winds at the top of the building had strong currents that were constantly moving. The problem with the air would cause the airships to constantly rotate around the building by its rear end. This made boarding and disembarking dangerous for the passengers, as well as for the cargo. The biggest obstacle for airships trying to dock at the Empire State Building is the existing law prohibiting flying too low over urban areas, which can be found in paragraph @ NUM4. Mooring an airship would be a direct violation of the law.            

<START>

 

Many obstacles made the idea of mooring airships reckless from the start. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire ..." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) the idea of such a volatile object on the population became more of a threat than a luxury. The lead weights needed to support the craft could not be provided and would also prove to be dangerous. Given the nature of the Empire State Building, the modifications became tedious and added unnecessary difficulties. Winds at this altitude would also cause mooring and instability problems. Finally, the plane passed the airship because it could travel faster and hold the same number of people, if not more, in a small area. Airships have become dangerous and bulky, and would not benefit New York as Al Smith had hoped.

From "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, on the obstacles the Empire State Building builders faced in trying to allow airships to dock where nature and the law prohibit airships flying too low over urban areas. The biggest obstacle encountered by the builders was nature. "The winds from the top of the building are constantly changing due to strong drafts." In addition, the stern of the ships would force the airship to turn due to high winds. Then using lead weights in the Empire State Building they would be hanging over the people in the streets below and that is not safe. The next hurdle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made airships illegal to fly over the building.

The Empire State Building was built with great potential, but it will never reach it fully. The Empire State Building was supposed to reach @ NUM1 feet, which is a few inches taller than the Chrysler Building, when the architect who designed the @ CAPS1 Building crept in and glued a 46-foot post on top. Of course, the Empire State Building had to be taller, so they set a new goal and reached 1,250 feet on December 11, 1929. Al Smith, @ New York CAPS2 and architect, decided that the Empire State Building needed an icing on the cake, so he decided to put a mooring mast for the zeppelins on top. This plan was doomed to disaster: the foundations were not stable enough for the zeppelins, they could easily be blown out of control and onto the sharp point of the building, and also, since the zeppelins contained hydrogen, they could explode. and come across the densely populated @ LOCATION1. Overall, the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was built for the disaster

The builders had to face many obstacles in trying to allow the mooring of airships. One hurdle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars for the value of the structural modifications to the building. In paragraph @ NUM1, he said that a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's framing. The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure had to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly a hundred feet below. Due to this problem, the frame of the whole building had to change to adapt to the new situation. More obstacles have poured in after the new changes. When the building was framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mooring mast framing could take place. The mast should also have a steel skeleton, indicated in paragraph @ NUM2,

Clearly there were issues trying to dock airships on the Empire State Building. The first reason is that the law against flying airships too low over the Empire State Building made it difficult. Then the thoughts are dangerous because some airships use hydrogen instead of helium and the hydrogen is flammable One big reason is that when the German airship was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of The Empire State Building then realized how much worse the crash could have been had it occurred in such a densely populated area as downtown New York. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the airships down, but they found that was neither practical nor safe. It was clear that there were problems in docking the airships to the Empire State Building; but it is probably a much safer choice both for residents / citizens of New York and for anyone who has worked there before, such as architects, engineers and aviation pioneers.     

<START>

 

THE OBSTACLE FOR THE BUILDERS TO LEAVE AIRSHIPS AT THE DOCK AT THE STATE OF THE EMPIRE BUILDING WAS A LOT. FOR ONE, THE MOORING MAST WOULD ADD A STRESS TO THE FRAMEWORK OF THE BUILDINGS, THE WEIGHT OF AIRSHIPS AND THE WIND PRESSURE WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE FOUNDATION OF THE BUILDINGS. "WINDS CHANGE DUE TO STRONG AIR CURRENTS". “EVEN IF AIRSHIPS WERE ATTACHED TO THE MAST, THE BACK OF SHIPS WOULD TURN AROUND. AND ALSO THE LAW THAT AIR SHIPS CANNOT FLY LOW IN URBAN AREAS.

According to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to attach an airship mooring unit to the top of the building. In paragraph @ NUM1, @ CAPS1 says "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." and Then describes how strong winds can make the mast unstable. Another obstacle in the making of the mast was a law stating that tanks could not fly below a certain altitude. The set altitude was higher as the building was tall. The last obstacle was security, in paragraph @ NUM2 @ CAPS1 explains how some airships are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The effect of an airship fire on a densely populated area would be devastating. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a neat idea, but it took a lot of obstacles to make it work.      

<START>

 

According to the excerpt, the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow the airships to dock there were a safety obstacle. Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over densely populated areas like downtown New York. The biggest obstacle to using the mooring mast was nature itself. The airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship pivoted around and around the mooring mast. Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted aft with lead weights. The other practical reason that airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was the current law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area.                 

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There were two main ones: security and nature. The builders should have realized that the idea was not sure, before building. Most airships in other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which was highly flammable. An accident over densely populated New York City would be serious. The biggest obstacle was nature. There were strong drafts which caused constantly changing winds to the top of the building. This would rotate the stern of the vessel around the mooring mast. There was also a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This means that it would be illegal to tie an airship to the building anyway.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles. Their goal was to build a moor above the building so that airships, or airships, could dock. In the end, they did not succeed. One of the obstacles was “ the lack of a suitable landing zone ”. Without it, the wharf would not work. Another major obstacle is the security reason. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly fammable." They could easily catch fire and injure many innocent people. Which leads to two other reasons. "Nature itself." It could easily start a fire with the wind. "Existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." Airships could harm innocent people. Many other obstacles were found and this plan failed.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. For example, someone attempted a publicity stunt where they would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. The workers' assembly equipment had never been installed because, putting the workers having to grab the bundle of papers on a rope hanging from the airship in great danger. In addition, the wind at the top of the building puts workers at a high risk of falls or death.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when they attempted to let airships dock there. There were @ NUM1 major issues as to why it was so hard to tie them down to the Empire State Building. Those obstacles were what was in airships, the "nature" of the winds around New York City, and a new airship restriction law passed. Airships Unlike balloons, which are made of helium, airships are made of hydrogen. Hydrogen is very flammable. It could have had terrible consequences if something caught fire since New York is so dense. Another problem they faced was the high winds from New York. They were moving constantly, so they were thinking about tying the airships with lead, but that would be a bad idea because if the lead fell off it would hurt a lot of people. Finally, they recently passed a law banning airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law were very strict, airships would not be allowed to dock there because it might be too close to town. In conclusion, there were many obstacles that architects did not think about before building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in an attempt to allow the devils to tie up there. Builders were in competition to become the tallest building in the world. This made them rush out and really @ CAPS1 for it. The archers had to find a way to build this pole. "more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the building". They had to repair the frame of the building so that the wind would affect the rest of the building. "The stress of the load of the airships and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." The builder and the archers had to overcome reality. It was not safe and airships are highly flammable. It would be a terrible accident if we eliminated in town. Also many laws @ CAPS2 airships flying at low altitude in urban areas. The builders had to face many problems while trying to build the tallest building.

The main building was to be the tallest building in the world. This all changed to be able to have a mooring mast so airships could land there to drop / pick up passengers and refuel. They had "@ NUM1 thousand dollars" in renovations to strengthen the structure of the tower. they couldn't make the foundation strong enough to support the weight of a @ NUM2ft ship + one cargo.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. " The stress of the load of airships in the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below " is understood in paragraph nine. It was the biggest hurdle that manufacturers faced. The builders devised a plan of “ Rather than building a utility mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within, with a recessed design that mimicked the general shape of Although the mast was finished due to @ CAPS1 Nature, a new law, no airship was ever docked at the Empire State Building.      

<START>

 

Following the idea of building a mooring mast, the builder encountered some obstacles in the construction of the mast. The first problem was structural, the weight of the airship that attached it with a single tie would put a lot of pressure on the building. It has been said that between the load of the airship and the pressure of the wind, the stress would be distributed up to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle was security. Many airships outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium which is highly flammable. The owners realized the "Hindenburg" incident and realized the effects it could have on downtown New York. The last obstacle was nature as the winds were turning at the top of the building. The problem discussed about this was that despite the airships being attached, they could pivot around the mast. The many obstacles encountered led to the mooring mast not being built to its full function and airships were less commonly used.        

<START>

 

The obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were the strength of the frame of the buildings, nature and some laws against it. A big issue with building a landing for airships on the Empire State Building was the strength of the base. "A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's frame." (paragraph @ NUM1). Another obstacle that the D-Day builders had to overcome was the element of nature. The winds atop the Empire State Building were always changing due to the strong air currents. An airship attached to a mooring mast had the potential to wrap around the mooring mast in unpredictable winds. Workers could not trust the airships not to fall off the mooring mast and risk the airship falling where thousands of pedestrians were walking. The last hurdle that workers had to overcome was an existing law that prevented airships from flying low over urban areas. "This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the vessel ..." (paragraph @ NUM2). All of these obstacles turned out to be too much for workers to handle, as the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was never created.

The Empire State Building is one of the greatest symbols of the United States. With the destruction of the World Trade Center, it is the tallest building in the city. Many know its famous spire at its top, but few really know why it is there. The truth is, it was meant to be a mooring dock for airships, or zeppelins, steel-lined balloons fitted with steering propellers. The sad truth is that it never happened. According to the article "The Mooring Mast", the environmental conditions as well as the security conditions were too bad to accommodate. Apparently, wind currents at such a high altitude are a concern, and if an airship were strapped to the top, great pressure would be placed on the building's frame. It takes time and is expensive to repair. In addition, there would be no practical way to weigh the balloon down without risking hitting civilians. Not only that, but it was illegal to have aerial ships so low over urban areas. In short, the whole idea was just wishful thinking, because it could not have happened.

The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles to allow airships to dock there. For example, paragraph @ NUM1 talks about the Hindenburg fire over New Jersey + how dangerous it would have been over a heavily populated area like New York. 

<START>

 

During any type of construction, builders face some type of obstacles just like the Empire State Building builders. One of the obstacles that builders face when trying to let airships dock on the Empire State Building is the high flammability they have. A German airship was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and if that had happened in New York, with a more densely populated area, the crash would have been much worse. Another obstacle they faced, their biggest obstacle, was the power of nature. The drafts were strong, so the winds were constantly changing and this caused the airship to rotate around the mooring mast, even though it was attached to it. A final hurdle they faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas, like New York City. Seeing the hurdles they faced, the builders realized that being able to dock an airship to the mast atop the Empire State Building just wasn't meant to be.      

<START>

 

In Marcia's "The Mooring Mast", the coveted builders who tried to allow airships or "airships" to moor to the Empire State Building's mooring mast encountered problems they did not have. not taken into account. These were variations of airships they hadn't planned, safety concerns, and also laws they would have to break in order to have airship terrain. The builders when making the mast did not think about any of these things. The problems that builders would face would appear just after the mast was raised. For starters, airship differences between countries were a factor, as the airships in @ LOCATION2 used helium to keep the airship in flight, but in places outside of the States they used hydrogen which is flammable. . This is a major issue for a place like New York which is densely populated. Another safety issue that they cannot control was nature, high winds at the top of the building would move the rear of the airship and also when landing the window could push the airship into the mast which would pierce the airship. the dome. These two safety reasons explain why airships land on the ground. However, even without these two reasons, there was a legal problem, a law that stated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. This would make mooring on the vessel illegal. Not having taken all of these things into account, the builders installed the mast, but sadly they would later have to deal with airship differences, safety concerns, and legal issues that they did not take into account.

The Empire State Building was built to compete with the Chrysler Building and to compete they created a mooring mast. The obstacles that limited the airships were: nature, the wind changes at the top of the building were drastic and some airships contained a large amount of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Another reason is that it is illegal for planes to fly low over urban areas. The above examples were all complications that limited the derigibles to docking to the Empire State Building.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the challenges of creating a mooring mast atop a 1250 foot tall building are discussed. In @ DATE1's Al Smith, the then governor had the idea of giving the Empire State Building its own landing dock for Airships. Throughout the process, the builders faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. The first obstacle was to place the mast at the top of the building. "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). If builders did it, it would put too much stress on the building. The issue was resolved after spending more than @ MONEY1 on a steel frame to support the mast. However, most of the manufacturers' issues could not be resolved. Safety was a major issue, most airships were built with hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. It would be a huge problem if a fire were to occur in a densely populated area. In addition, the airships would be too high to tie up. Moreover, if the airships land there, it would be in violation of an existing law. As a result, the builders faced so many obstacles that they were unable to build the mast.

In @ ORGANIZATION2's "The Mooring Mast", the builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to land there. One of the main hurdles was security, mainly because when foreign airships arrived they most likely contained hydrogen (highly flammable). After the Hindenburg crash, they were more wary if something like this happened in a densely populated area. An unstoppable obstacle for the builders was nature; with the strong winds interfering in the release of the passengers, that would be difficult enough. According to the article, lead weights were used to land airships in the open in bad weather, but the builders did not use them, so there was no chance they would fall and hit someone. . Through all of this trouble, the builders always had the most practical problem; "Law against airships flying too low over urban areas." With this issue, it was illegal to tie an airship to the Empire State Building so close to the ground. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never performed as expected, the builders went through obstacle research just for the sake of thought.

The competitive spirit of New York Governor Al Smith drove him and his architects to build a mooring site for airships atop the Empire State Building. Instead of seeing the daunting task ahead, they saw the opportunity to become the epitome of modern travel. When they decided to build a mooring atop the Empire State Building, the architects knew they would face multiple obstacles. The first hurdle they faced was how to adjust the building's framing to support the mooring site. The architects knew that the building "would have to be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation" (par. @ NUM1). They have managed to overcome this obstacle, but many more are on the horizon. Wind and weather also had to be taken into consideration. " The winds at the top of the building were constantly turning " (par. @ NUM2). Reluctantly, the builders admitted the inevitable obstacle posed by nature. The builders seem to realize how unrealistic this dream was. Two more obstacles awaited us, and these would put the mooring dock to rest forever. An airship floating above a densley populated town was an utterly dangerous idea. It was noted that hydrogen was highly flammable (par. @ NUM3) and that a fire would be detrimental to both the building and the city. The last obstacle they faced was the law, and they were unable to overcome it. They realized that there was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas" (by @ NUM4). The impossibility of the plan was realized because there were too many obstacles to face. The builders have given up hope, but the moorings still stand on top of the Empire State Building as a reminder of what could have been.

The first @ DATE1 was a time when everyone was looking for and building the next best thing. In @ CAPS1, two tycoons competed to build the tallest building in the world. Al Smith, the man who created the Empire State Building, had the idea to make his building bigger and more popular; build an airship mooring mast on top of your building. While this was a good creative idea, the obstacles its architects would face would turn out to be more than they anticipated. First of all, putting a mooring mast over the Empire State Building was very impractical without changing the whole design. the backbone of the Empire State Building should be amended and strengthened to adapt to this new situation "(@ @ CAPS2 NUM1). In addition, the airship would put so much pressure on the building's foundations. " The stress of load of the airship and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building ... "(@ CAPS2 @ NUM1). Nature was also a giant obstacle that these architects faced during the construction of this one . "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself", (@ CAPS2 @ NUM3) As you can see, these architects faced many challenges when building this this mast, which unfortunately never bore fruit.

The obstacles encountered by the builder of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there are as follows. The Washington government was considering a safe way to moor the airships to the mast. He never wanted to reach the top because he didn't want an accident to happen and something to happen. The wind at the top of the building was constantly changing due to strong drafts. The weight of the construction, it would be hanging over pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. It was also a law.    

<START>

 

In order to moor these airships, the builders would face many serious problems. These problems that builders would be forced to face is when, a city, and a setting. First of all, the building's frame was too weak to attach to an airship. Indeed, this "would add constraints" to the framework which could "be transmitted to the foundations of the building". For this reason, they would be forced to spend "over sixty thousand dollars" to strengthen the framework. A second problem they faced is that it is in a city. The laws forbade "flying too low over urban areas", let alone "attaching yourself to the building". As a result, they would be forced to devise a way for it to dock. Finally, "violent drafts" would cause more problems. Builders would have to face up to building mooring equipment that could withstand the wrath of "nature itself". Overall, this plan would impose a lot of problems on builders, in order to operate          

<START>

 

From the start, the Empire State Building had architectural requirements that posed several hurdles for builders, especially when it came to building the mooring mast for airships. Initially, the Empire State Building was built only for indoor use, so the mast would add stress to the building's framing and potentially damage it. Second, the Empire State Building was built in a very densely populated area, so if any malfunctions were to occur, like the Hindenburg in 1937, many people could be killed below. Another problem with the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing, and they were also very strong, so any airship mountings on the building were in danger of rotating and blowing off when landing. The masters of the architectural age had made a real mistake in planning the construction of the Empire State Building, and it could never have reached its potential for many obvious reasons.     

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to make airships. The first obstacle was the creation of the mooring mast. In @ CAPS1 four, it is written: "That dream of the pioneers of aviation was to travel by airship, or zepplin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast on top to moor these new airships." The Empire State Building's frame was not strong enough for the mooring mast, so builders had to modify it. In new @ CAPS1, they say, "The Empire State Building's steel framing should be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation." One obstacle that stopped the use of the mooring mast was the wind. In @ CAPS1 fifteenth, they were unable to dock, "the US Navy airship Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but was unable to get close enough to dock due to high winds. Another hurdle they faced was safety. In @ CAPS1 @ NUM1, they describe that " most airships coming in from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and l “Hydrogen is highly flammable. There are problems that manufacturers could and could not solve.        

<START>

 

The builders were faced with certain problems such as weather conditions. The winds were strong due to the changing wind currents. Another was the law on the distance between an aircraft and a building. Another problem was that the building had to be strong enough to hold an airship in place. Builders would need to strengthen the skeleton of buildings for this to work. This is what they did. Another problem is that some foreign airships are made with hydrogen. This makes them very flammable. With others in helium. The hydrogen could catch fire and fall on pedestrians. These are the problems they faced.          

<START>

 

some of the obstacles that builders faced while still allowing airships to dock there would be that they lacked a proper landing zone. one of the main obstacles that occurred would be nature. moving air currents moved constantly. the stern of the ship was constantly moving.   

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building allowed airships to dock at the top of the building, as this made the building much taller than it was. He lost his position as the bigger one and then got it back by creating the airship dock (Blimps) 

<START>

 

In Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1's The Mooring Mask, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered problems while trying to dock the airships. One big obstacle is that airships were a safety hazard. For example, " Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable ." If an airship had caught fire while docked in such a populated area, many people could have been killed. Another problem was nature, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." This would cause the back of the airship to rotate, making it dangerous. The builders faced many obstacles and unfortunately were never able to dock an airship to the Empire State Building        

<START>

 

In the construction of the mast that was to be used to moor and refuel airships, the builders and architects @ CAPS2 encountered many formidable problems. On the one hand, a simple mooring mast could not be placed on the roof of the Empire State Building. The mast would add a lot of stress to the framing of the building and cause it to collapse, along with huge wind power. Another problem was that "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium to inflate their airships. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable. There was also a law that stated that airships could not @ CAPS1 too low over urban areas One of the last and most important reasons for builders @ CAPS2 were the constant obstacles of the wind due to the violent draft Even with the airships attached to the mooring mast, the aft end swiveled around the mast with the wind.

There are many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. one of the issues was the stress the airship would add to the building. more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the framework of the buildings. In addition, most airships contained hydrogen which is highly flammable and dangerous. Another dangerous aspect is that this huge piece of material would be suspended above pedestrians, as opposed to the usual much safer landing of open fields. Finally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, which would also cause mooring problems.     

<START>

 

The biggest obstacle was safe. Foreign airships use hydrogen gas (@ NUM1) as a means of flight, but hydrogen gas is highly flammable. Empire State Building owners were concerned about what happened to the German airship Hindenburg over Lakehurst, @ LOCATION2. The Hindenburg caught fire and in less than a minute the airship was gone, just charred junk. If this incident were to occur in a densely populated area like downtown New York City, it would result in a high number of casualties and deaths.    

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building ran into obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there due to "nature itself" and past issues that have occurred. One obstacle that manufacturers faced was ensuring safety. After the Lakehurst fire, @ LOCATION3, builders were concerned about issues that could arise, especially when it takes place in downtown New York. Another obstacle was "nature itself". With the mooring mast at the top of the building, the builders were frightened by the strong drafts. The last hurdle was that it was a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. It was therefore illegal for an airship to be attached to a building. The builders faced three main obstacles - "Nature itself", a past accident and the law. Unfortunately, they could not continue their work because the obstacles were just too strong.    

<START>

 

Allowing airships to dock at the Empire State Building would have been completely different than anything that had happened before, but never continued due to obstacles. The builders were faced with issues such as safety concerns, the exploitation of nature and the law itself. The airships had safety concerns, including a fire, which occurred and the manufacturers "realized how much worse this accident could have been" (¶ @ NUM1) Another safety concern was to stabilize the airships, this which would have required free weights suspended over the city. Yet another obstacle was the power of nature; it would have been almost impossible to hold the airship in place. Because of the wind "the stern of the ship swiveled around ... the mooring mast" (¶ @ NUM2). The new idea was good, but the law was also against it, because of the airship's low height. As stated, "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel ..." (¶ @ NUM3). The Empire State Building mast moorland caused too many obstacles for the project to be completed. While this would have opened new doors for transportation, there were too many security breaches to make it worth it.         

<START>

 

While trying to build a mooring dock above the Empire State Building, the builders had a few issues to overcome. The winds in New York were too strong to fly an airship, one driver said "the captain could not take his hands off the control levers." @ CAPS1 so close to buildings in an airship was illegal for fear of crashing into "the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area". The only way to keep the airship from rocking violently was to put heavy lead weights on it, but that wouldn't be practical over New York. In conclusion, docking a tank with the Empire State Building was too difficult and it never happened.

The builders encountered many obstacles during the construction of the Empire State Building. They were in competition with the Chrysler building because of its height. Al Smith, the builder of the Empire State wanted to build the tallest and most famous building in the world. He made the buildings appear invincible. He even put a mooring mast there so things could land there. But it was never meant to survive for that purpose, it was only created for publicity. Because about the mooring mast, the building would not have succeeded in becoming popular. Al Smith did everything to make this building what it is today and he is still standing in New York today.       

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow airships to land there. One is that the weight of the zeppelin, once attached to the building, would put immense pressure on the frame and the pressure would even reach the foundation. The cost of reworking the frame to make it more secure would have been @ MONEY1. Another obstacle was the expectations of the public. The building was meant to change the way we travel forever, yet it is a beautiful and magnificent structure. The pressure to build the tallest tower in the world surely touched them. These expectations were so unreal because most people didn't know enough to understand the security risk involved.

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were not easy. It was necessary to draw the plan of the mooring mast. The builders must have thought of the thousand-foot airship that would be docked atop the Empire State Building. You had to think about the wind pressure and the load on the airship. The builders had to come up with brilliant ideas. The ideas were "a tower of shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel" (@ CAPS1 paragraph @ NUM1) on top of the building. The builders had to build and think about the elevators and stairs to get the airship passengers to the eighty-sixth floor. The eighty-sixth floor had luggage and tickets. They would come from the hundred and second floor. The builders had a difficult job as they had to brainstorm ideas on how to construct the building's mooring mast. They also had to think about how to get passengers in and out of the airship. The builders encountered obstacles while construction of the building was in progress.

The Empire State Building at the time of its construction was designed to be the tallest building in the world. However, it was not an easy task. The workers overcame a particularly difficult obstacle, the airships @ CAPS1, or airships, to dock there. The plan was to build a mooring mast above the building that would allow airships to dock. If this could be achieved, it was said that the Empire State Building would be “equipped for an era of transportation…” However, many problems arose. The weight of airships should be able to be held safely. The architects knew that the weight would put pressure on the frame of the building. The workers had to modify and reinforce the framework of the buildings. Workers also constructed the mast from a strong, shiny chrome-nickel. Another obstacle was encountered when the mast was taken into consideration. The frame was originally stopped on the eighty-fifth floor. Workers had to finish the roof before the mast could be framed. Although the workers succeeded in making a safe mast, the “ Dream of the Aviation Pioneers ” never saw the light of day.

Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building so that airships could anchor there for refueling or service and allow people to get on and off. To do this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be " modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation ". They would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars on frame modifications. The builders had to build 102 floors and also create a glazed viewing area as well as an open viewing platform. In addition, they had to finish the roof and then move on to the construction of the steel mast with glass windows. After all this time and money spent recreating the building, the airships couldn't dock there. The wind was so strong that the stern of the ship was still moving. Also, there is a law that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. It wasn't worth it in the end.

Due to several factors, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow airships to dock there. A serious obstacle was that the airship moored to the top of the building held only by a tether was stressing the structure of the building. In paragraph nine, it says “ the Empire State Building should be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation. More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the structure. Another complication was nature itself. Above the city there were strong winds which were constantly moving due to the drafts. This made docking impossible. Just as nature opposed the mooring mast, so too was the law. In paragraph fifteen, it says "on the existing law against airships flying too low over low-lying urban areas". Which made it illegal for an airship to dock the Empire State Building.

The Empire State Building faces many obstacles like in paragraph @ NUM1, "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame." This was one of the many problems airships encountered in landing on the Empire State Building. In paragraph @ NUM2, they @ CAPS1 to realize that the mooring mast of @ ORGANIZATION1 was not built, as it would not work. it should have been apparent before it was ever built. The reason for the mooring mast was because of nature. As you will see in paragraph @ NUM3, "the wind was moving because of the strong air currents." The mooring mast had a lot of problems From the start, Al Smith put a roof on the building to make 1,250. It was dangerous for the planes. When they wanted to land the airships on the building. The airships that came from other countries had hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The problem that worked against the mooring mast being built was the wind above the building @ CAPS2. Because of the drafts. These are the reasons why the mooring mast failed on the Empire State Building

When the Empire State Building was built, new ideas entered the minds of architects. Unfortunately, their vision of making it a @ NUM1 dock for boxes turned out to be unrealistic. The first challenge they encountered was how to attach a dock for an airship to the building without putting such strain on the building's framing. The building could potentially collapse with the added weight unless sixty thousand dollars of structural reinforcement is completed. Another obstacle that architects faced was nature. Atop the Empire State Building, the winds were so strong that the airships would sway too violently for pilots to dock them safely. The last reason airships couldn't be docked at the Empire State Building was that there were laws prohibiting planes from flying this low. It was actually considered illegal to moor the airship there because it would have to fly low enough to get close to the building. Due to these factors, the Empire State Building could not become a dock to support airships.

From my reading, I understand that the difficulties of building a mooring dock on top of a structure such as the Empire State Building were many. a no-brainer was the structural stability throughout the building. Paraphrased from the passage, the tension of the airship pulling on the lanyard would cause a stress on the frame of the building. another controlled the airship while docking. The passage explained that the winds above the Empire State Building would change violently and frequently. Safety as well as an issue, especially after the crash in Hindenburg, New Jersey, when a German zeplin caught fire and exploded.

Obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building were the construction of a mast, airships docking at the top of the building, and an airship law. Architects and builders spend a lot of time building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. The airships were trying to figure out how to tie up to the building, but most airships failed. A law the airships were not able to dock in urban areas in the event of a problem within the airships. These were the obstacles that builders faced in attempting to create a mast and allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building.

The obstacles faced by builders in constructing the Empire State Building were; security, time. The construction safety of the top of the Empire State Building was in the way because it was so high that it would be difficult to lift the glass and steel pieces to the top. Another reason it was dangerous, because if any part of the glass or steel was pushed back, people would be low. Another reason is that the blinps fly too close to buildings and hit one of them. Also the passengers getting on and off the blinp ; they had to make sure that the passengers were not injured. The time they had to build the top of the Empire State Building was not long enough. " It's level, okay. No kidding. We're working on it now. "

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of @ CAPS2 when trying to get airships to dock there. The builders struggled with this morning mast construction. They had to take care of the frame of the building. One big obstacle they had was that they didn't have a suitable landing zone for the airships. They not only had to deal with @ man-made CAPS2, but also nature's @ CAPS2. The wind at the top of the building made a safe landing almost impractical. "The Empire State Building's metal framework should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). The builders of the building realized that to make this plan possible, they would have to redo the structure of the building. The building was not even designed to allow airships to land on top of the building. The workers were blind to any possible problems with the design of the mooring mast. There were too many @ CAPS2 workers had to go through and the airship landing never worked.

To allow Dirigibles to @ CAPS1 on the empire state @ CAPS2, builders would face some tough hurdles. One obstacle would be if the technology was developing in the 1930s by the time they were @ CAPS3 with @ ORGANIZATION1 and airplanes were invented. "the still unresolved problem of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone the fine installation of the landing gear to a later date." this @ CAPS4 proves that they have already done the technology to land airships safely but, @ CAPS5 to see if the mast really worked. This @ CAPS6 this technology was invented @ CAPS7 that builders could even make the mast on top of the Empire State Building. Later, it was thought that an airship would be dangerous on top of a mast because the wind would blow it and crash into the building. It was @ CAPS8 to begin with.

In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles to allow the airships to dock there. One obstacle that the builders faced was when they were building the mooring mast to hold the airships. The single cable tie that would hold the airships together would add stress to the framing of the buildings. The builders had to come up with a new idea that wouldn't put pressure on the building. Another hurdle that manufacturers had to face is that it would be safe for passengers. As the building is so high, the fear of falling from the airship worried them. A final hurdle that builders have faced is the "existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas," which prohibited a ship from mooring to the building. The builders faced many obstacles during the construction of the mooring mast.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the airships to dock at the top of the building. The first hurdle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be changed. The excerpt says that "more than sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the frame of the building". Another obstacle was security. After the German airship Hindenburg caught fire, builders realized how severe the devastation would be if it happened over the densely populated New York City. Nature was also a big obstacle. The changing air currents at the top of the building would make the airship very unstable. It would be dangerous to have an unstable airship suspended above the crowded city streets. Finally, at the time, there was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas." These obstacles are what the architects of the Empire State Building attempted to allow airships to dock there.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered some problems when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. The stress of the airship and the pressure of the wind should be transmitted nearly eleven hundred feet below, to the foundation of the building. This in turn means that builders would have to go back and modify the Empire State Building's frame so that it was sturdy enough to accommodate airships. Over sixty thousand dollars of changes are expected to be made. As construction progressed, once the framing was completed up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mooring mast framing could take place.

Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there were safety, nature, and the law. One of the biggest obstacles was security. Since airships had to be lighter than air, most are filled with helium or hydrogen. "Most of the airships outside @ LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium and the hydrogen is highly flammable." This is a big obstacle because if the airship is high above the ground of @ CAPS1 and then catches fire, it could end badly, another obstacle was nature ; because of the violent drafts which made the buildings sway. This is also bad because if the airship moves or if the building swings in the building, either one could break. The last obstacle was the law, which was against "airships flying too low over urban areas". So if they built the mast, it would even be illegal to approach an airship. Here are some obstacles encountered by builders during the construction of the Empire State Building to moor airships.

The builders had to overcome many obstacles while trying to dock the airships to the top of the Empire State Building. One to be exact would be the wind, although they would tie up the airship in the back was not and the wind would blow @ ORGANIZATION2 decide. Which would affect the building. “ The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. " With this discovery, they had to make some changes to the building, which would cost them more money. Other hurdles they encountered was actually being able to dock it, as it's a law that you can't do that with some people underneath. "The other practical reason why airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas." @ CAPS1 are just a few of the obstacles architects went through when trying to dock airships.         

<START>

 

First of all, the Empire State Building was not designed to land airships on it. The architects had to rethink the entire top of the building. When they did that, they never bothered to pull out the proper landing gear for the airships. It was a bad day, weather wise, so it would be very difficult to land an airship without the proper landing gear. The airship is over @ NUM1 feet long, without a very large landing service it would be dangerous to people in the airship, people on the ground, and people helping to land the airship.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One problem they faced was having to build the mooring mast because without it, the derigable would add stress to the structure of the building. In paragraph @ NUM1, it says "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." Even though the builders made the mooring mass, it was dangerous to moor airships from the building. "The main reason was safety: most airships coming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable." Overall, the builders faced a lot of obstacles and failed to dock the airships to the building.

According to the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in trying to allow airships to dock there were safety, applicable laws and changes in drafts. Many airships "from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (@ NUM1). The owners of the Empire State Building realized that a much worse situation would arise if it caught fire "over a densely populated area" (@ NUM1). Another practical reason why airships did not dock at the top of the building was that there was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas" (@ NUM3). The airship would be "hanging over pedestrians in the streets" which is quite dangerous (@ NUM4). The last hurdle that the builders faced was the movement of air currents to the top of the building. If the airships were attached to the mooring mast, "the stern of the ship would rotate endlessly" (@ NUM4). This could be dangerous for pedestrians on the street, as well as for boarding passengers and steers. These practical reasons called for the idea of the mooring mast to be lessened.

The obstacles encountered by the Empire State Building were numerous. While airships; airships could moor there. One obstacle was the construction of several floors. They had to build more floors so that the people on the airships could have something to load and unload on the ship. Another obstacle was the construction of steel frames from the 85th floor to the 102nd floor. It cost them more than @ MONEY1 worth of modifications, which had to be made to the frame of the buildings

the Empire State Building faced many problems. To moor an airship, he needed a good, secure mooring site. In addition, the wind so high would make it almost impossible for an airship to stay at the dock.

In this fascinating story "The Mooring Mast" written by author Marcia Amidon Lüsted tells about the Empire State Building and its enormous. Although the construction of this building took time and effort from the workers, they did not exactly achieve the purpose of the mooring mast. There were many reasons they faced conflicts while attempting to let the airships dock in the mooring mast. For example, the airship was made of helium rather than hydrogen, and the hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York, it would have been an utter tragedy. Another reason is that airships were moored in open airstrips, so they could be ballasted. Author Marcia writes, "but using them in the Empire State Building, where they would hang over pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe." This is so, and there are many other reasons why workers find it difficult to build the mooring mast.

In the clip, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. For starters, one of the biggest obstacles was the act of nature. “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong air currents ,” which made it difficult for the airship to have a safer landing. The other obstacle was that there was a law, which went against airships flying low over urban areas. In conclusion, the Empire State Building's mooring mast was not used for landing an airship such as the airship because it was too dangerous. In addition, they used the mooring mast for other safe purposes.

At first, using airships seemed like a good idea. They could be the new form of transportation and seemed to have no flaws. As the development of airships progressed, it was showing signs of trouble. Engineers had planned to dock the airship to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of stress to the building's framing. They then discovered that security was an issue. Most airships used hydrogen instead of helium which was flammable. In addition, they had to use lead weights to hold the airship to the ground when it was docked. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians in the street. Without the lead weights, the airship would simply pivot in the air with the ability to pierce its hull. Finally, there was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. It even made it illegal for the ship to approach the building. There were high hopes for the use of airships, but in the end they had more disadvantages than advantages.

In an attempt to build an airship destination, in the Empire State Building, architects had to deal with @ CAPS3 issues like an airship crash or just nature itself. @ CAPS3 problems like an airship crash would be costly, lives would be lost in the densely populated city and the explosion could destroy buildings around and the Empire State Building itself. To prevent this from happening, the government had already enacted a law prohibiting flying planes from approaching urban areas. To build this @ CAPS1, architects would have to break the laws or bend the rules. Another contradictory idea, which disrupted, plans for an airship docking station would be nature, high winds could easily sway an airship, and the sway could cause the airship to pierce into a nearby building, "Even though the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would still pivot around the mooring mast. " (@ CAPS2 @ NUM1) The pivot, as previously mentioned, could strike near a building and injure civilians. The problems and the laws @ CAPS3 which prevented the creation of the mast should have been realized before, the idea will never be possible.

The Empire State Building is known as the tallest building in the world. The building is located in New York. Al Smith, the person responsible for the construction of the Empire State Building, added a top or hat to the building, which made the building even more distinctive than any other building in the city. The Empire State Building was equipped for transportation. The transport was airship, or zeppelin. The Empire State Building had a mooring mast at its top to moor the new airships. One obstacle the building faced was the lack of a suitable landing zone in New York. Al saw an opportunity to bring people to and from the Empire State Building. Al saw it as something creative and new. The Empire State Building's mooring mast was never made. No security thought was thought of before building the idea either. The main reason was that most airships outside of the US used hydrogen rather than helium which is a higher @ CAPS1 for flames.

Many obstacles presented themselves as the builders attempted to build a landing dock for airships on top of the Empire State Building. Among the obstacles were public safety, @ CAPS1 already in place and unpredictable weather. Many airships use highly flammable hydrogen gas. After the sinking of the German Hindenburg, it became evident that public safety would be threatened by the burning of ships above the crowded streets. At the time, @ CAPS1 also prohibited planes from traveling too low over urban areas and the landing pad was too low. The last problem was the unpredictable weather. The Piolets feared that strong winds would push the ship moored in another building or into sharp arrows which would ruin the ship and put people in danger. There were many obstacles in the way of the Empire State Building's loading dock.

According to the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were high wind currents and an already existing law that prohibited airships flying too much. low above urban areas. The number one reason the airships couldn't 'dock was due to too strong wind currents at the top of the Empire State Building. It was mentioned in paragraph @ NUM1 that “ the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts. Even if the airships were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast. Airships moored in open airstrips had to be ballasted at the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor sure. " @ CAPS1 was said here that it would be dangerous for people if the airship is moored near the Empire State during violent air currents. The other reason the airships couldn't dock was because of the law saying they were against low airship theft over urban areas. @ CAPS1 this law prohibited vessels from mooring to the vessel and even from approaching the area. It was said in paragraph @ NUM2 that the airships attempted to reach the building. "In December 1930, the US Navy Los Angeles airship approached the mooring mast but could not get out of the way. get close enough to moor due to the high winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the airship at the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area that would puncture the airship's hull, the captain could not even remove his hands from the control levers. As the airship was @ CAPS1 big, it couldn't get close enough due to sharp objects on other buildings. It is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building went through some tough obstacles in attempting to 'allow airships to dock there, all because of very strong winds or drafts and the already existing law against airships flying at low altitude over urban areas.

The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many different obstacles to allow airships to dock there. The major obstacle to allowing airships to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing zone. To allow the airships to anchor at Empire State Building for several hours, a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building. Architects couldn't just lay a mooring mast on the flat roofs of empire buildings, so rather than building a utility mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a tower in shiny glass and chrome stainless steel. nickel that would be illuminated from the inside. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast, it could be complete and useful. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. These are some of the hurdles that builders faced in allowing airships to dock on the Empire State Building.      

<START>

 

After planning and building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the developers discovered many issues they hadn't thought of before. They hadn't thought about the flammability of gases inside airships. They also didn't remember the "law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to a building" (@ NUM1 lines). In addition, the strong winds that would be so high above the ground would certainly prove to be a danger to all airships. If they had hit a nearby building, the results could be disastrous.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems that builders faced was that an airship docked at the top of the building would add stress to its frame. In paragraph @ NUM1, it says "Airship load stress and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly @ NUM2 feet below." The builders had to make sixty thousand dollars in modifications to strengthen the structure of the building. Another major issue they faced was security. "Most airships outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium." Hydrogen is extremely flammable and after an incident with the destruction of a German airship, they realized how dangerous it would be over a densely populated area. Another reason was nature. In paragraph @ NUM3, it says "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving." This made it difficult to dock and hold the plane so that passengers could get off safely. Even a navy pilot "couldn't get close enough to tie up because of the high winds." There was even a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. Docking atop the Empire State Building was doomed to fail because of all the obstacles the builders faced.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, builders broke obstacles to allow airships to dock in @ ORGANIZATION1, builders had to rethink the top of the Empire State Building. They had to make it bigger and more suitable for airships to land. They had problems because they weren't sure the airships would be suitable. Second, they had to design the mast. The builders had to design a whole different part of the airship. The builders also had to spend sixty thousand dollars to build the mast. The manufacturers have faced this big obstacle. Third, the builders also made a stainless steel tower for mooring airships. This was a hindrance as there was glass and chrome nickel stainless steel on the tower. The builders went through many obstacles for the airships to moor, when in the end the airships never had the chance to moor.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and allowed airships to dock with it like safety, nature, and the law. In the excerpt, the author tells how many airships use hydrogen which is very flammable. It makes it very dangerous to tie them up to the Empire State Building as they might have an accident, and since New York is so densely populated, it would likely hurt a lot of people. People's lives shouldn't be risked just to land an airship. Another problem that builders face was nature. In paragraph @ NUM1, the excerpt reads "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts." This would mean that the airship would simply be suspended high above New York City and the winds could turn dangerous very quickly because it was so unpredictable. According to the excerpt, it was neither practical nor safe. To add to all these obstacles, manufacturers have not considered an already existing law that prohibits airships flying too low over urban areas. So that meant that it would be illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State Building. The builders faced so many hurdles to allow tanks to dock at the Empire State Building that they just weren't meant to be.

As the builders tried to find a way for the airships to dock with the Empire State Building, some hurdles arose. If an airship were held by a single cable, it would add stress to the structure of the building. The airship had to be wired to the top, which was also difficult because of the Empire State's flat roof. The weather was also a huge obstacle. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1, line @ NUM2) The wind would sway the airship and would not be very stable. Builders also had to keep in mind that using the building could also be harmful to pedestrians, airships would be too close to the ground. Planning where these planes land and fill up was not an easy task for the manufacturers.

In the clip, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the nature, unsafe mooring conditions, and pre-existing laws against airships were just a few hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The main obstacle "to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself". On top of a building so tall, the wind is always changing direction, causing the airship to "spin". Airships or airships always landed in open fields and could be ballasted with lead weights, but using this technique "where they would be suspended over pedestrians ... was neither practical nor safe". The builders of the Empire State Building also stumbled upon "an existing law against airships flying low over urban areas." Henceforth, this law prohibited any airship from mooring or mooring to the building. Attempting to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building was not safe, practical, or legal.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in filling the @ ORGANIZATION1. The Empire State Building is @ NUM1 feet tall which posed some issues. Lüsted said: "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." The wind speed at the top of the Empire State Building would be terrible as the airship's tail is basically weightless and it would move violently, which could cause the support beams to give way or endanger the lives of people below. Lüsted said: "But using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be hung above pedestrians on the street is neither practical nor safe." Another reason the mooring mast cannot be built is the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. Lüsted said: "This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or even to approach the area." It's not even legal for the airship to be near the building, making it impossible to do.

The future of transportation is a question every architect has discussed at some point. Whether reality is taken into account is another matter. Al Smith took on the challenge of making the dream of mooring airships a reality. Although Smith had high hopes for the project, many obstacles stood in the way of the construction of the wharf. One problem is stated in paragraph fourteen, "the greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." Wind power was not considered at the time, nor was the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York were at risk. In conclusion, airships quickly became much more useless with the spark of the plane and quickly died with the dreams of the mooring mast. This destroyed all plans for the mast because not only was it risky to build, but it was also illegal. What was once just a glimpse of the future quickly turned into nothing as @ PERSON1 finally confronted the audience saying construction would be postponed. The future of transportation took a hard hit, but with the new airplane succession, anything seemed possible.

The Empire State Building was under construction, the building passed many obstacles. First, because they wanted to do the biggest construction in the world and they had to work hard.

Despite all the hopes and anticipations surrounding the construction of the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the project was never intended to be a success. In "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow the airships to dock on the mast. The first major obstacle encountered by the builders was that when an airship was mounted on the mooring " the stress of the airship load and the wind pressure had to be transmitted to the foundation of the building ". This obstacle resulted in the need for an abundance of additional support on the frame necessary to maintain the sturdiness of the building. The other, and arguably the biggest obstacle that the builders faced, were the rapid wind currents that surrounded the building. The winds caused problems for the airship because "even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way they would have to maintain control and safety of the airship as it was moored to the mooring. As much as the plan eclipsed any of its day, it was short-lived. The plan had far too many hurdles to overcome and serves best today as a memorable feature of the Empire State Building.

The obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock were issues such as strong winds, weak structure, and public safety. The strong winds would make it almost impossible to keep it stable at the top while the weak structure would make it almost impossible to keep the saflley at the top. with all of these dangers it is totally dangerous for people to get on, moor and board these huge airships on top of the Empire State Building.

Obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The first, he says the foundation of the building will be more stressful with an airship mooring of a thousand feet. For example, “ A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame. The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building. " The second, he says it's really dangerous if they take place on top of the building. For example," when The German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been had it taken place above 'a densely populated area ... like downtown New York. "@ CAPS1 It is said that the winds at the top of the building are so strong. For example, “ the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. " In conclusion, they still face many obstacles, so that the idea of letting the airship dock at the top of the building is hardly a reality.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast", the author, Marcia Amidon Lüsted, is an informant on the structural and natural obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. One obstacle encountered by builders was related to the structure of the building. The problem was that a moored airship, or airship, would add a significant amount of stress to the framing of the building. To solve this problem, the "framework of the Empire State Building should be modified and strengthened". Another obstacle encountered by builders concerned nature. The winds at the top of the building were strong and often changed direction. This hampered an airship's ability to dock at the top of the building and remained a problem. The last obstacle encountered was a restriction on the flight of airships over urban areas. This restriction made it impossible to dock airships atop the Empire State Building. The excerpt explains the structural and natural obstacles encountered by builders.

During the construction process of the Empire State Building, builders had to overcome obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock with it. Some of these obstacles changed the design of the building, thinking of the safety of people and the material of the airships. Since a thousand-foot airship moored at the top of the building would add stress to the building's framing, the building's steel framing would have to be altered and reinforced. Over sixty thousand dollars of modification work had to be spent. An airship was a steel-framed balloon with cotton cloth envelopes filled with hydrogen and helium. It was a security issue; Most airships used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. A German airship was destroyed by fire, and the owners of the Empire State Building realized how serious such an accident could be in downtown New York. When building the Empire State Building, there were a lot of obstacles that the builders had to overcome just to try and get the airship to dock with it.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. A few minor obstacles were the frame and the strength of the building. Other obstacles were major like the uncontrollable nature. In paragraph nine, the author explains that if a thousand-foot airship was docked atop the Empire State Building, it would add stress to the building's framing. In addition, with the pressure of the wind, the foundations of the building would be affected. In order to allow the airships to dock, the structure of the building should be modified and reinforced. As nature has a great influence on the use of the mooring mast, it would be almost impossible to attach airships to the vessel. The wind would rotate the airships around the mooring mast as the author describes in paragraph fourteen. Other hurdles the builders faced were most airships from outside the United States that used hydrogen rather than helium, most heavy airstrips in the back of airships would result in a weight (which wouldn't be safe to make them hang over pedestrians), the last problem was there was an existing law against airships flying low over urban areas. Although the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles to allow airships to dock, it still became a well-known building at @ LOCATION1.

Some of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that inside the airships was hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The builders didn't want to risk lives or damage buildings. They realized how much worse an accident could be if it happened in downtown New York. The biggest obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. The winds were constantly changing due to the drafts. In addition, airships would be suspended above pedestrians in the streets below. The last reason is that it was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law prohibited them from attaching it to the building or even approaching it.

When the architects behind the Empire State Building's mooring mast began working on its design, they didn't take into account the @ CAPS1 they would have to overcome to moor an airship. In the excerpt, he states that the mooring mast was not originally part of the Empire State Building's design structure: however, the stresses it would cause when docking an airship "should be transmitted to the foundations of the building". This meant that builders would need to design a way to do this when construction had already started. Others @ CAPS1 included those in security. The excerpt goes that "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen," which is more flammable than helium. This, combined with the fact that there was really no way to secure the story an airship moored to the mast could cause an accident @ CAPS2 to that of the Hindenburg over a "densely populated area like the center. -ville of New York "

According to the excerpt, this somehow shows that there were obstacles that builders faced in attempting to allow airships or airships to dock there. One of these examples was found in paragraph @ NUM1. He said, "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was designed never to serve its purpose." Another was also at paragraph @ NUM1 when they said "The main reason was safety : most airships outside the US used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized just how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place on top of it. a densely populated area like downtown New York.

In the clip Marcia Amidon Lüsted's Mooring Mast There Were Significant Obstacles The builders of the Empire State Building faced up to get the airships to moor and come to rest. The airship was highly flammable, the structure was dangerous laws and @ CAPS4 was asking them to tie up to it. First, airships are highly flammable near a building that is so important to its @ CAPS1. "Today, these airships are made of camouflage fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to have more light in the air." These airships in the United States only have hydrogen which is the ultimate fire starter. Second, the structure never passed for a human passenger to climb onto the structure and ride the airship. The law states that “ low-flying planes to urban areas are @ CAPS2 ”. @ CAPS3 why this could never happen. Third, @ CAPS4 can never always be right 24 hours a day. The problem is that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving strong drafts." This Put lives in @ CAPS5, they were obstacles in mooring airships.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" from author @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there.

In the clip, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow the airship to dock there. One of those obstacles is stress. Yes, stress. This is because when you have a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the Empire State Building, which is only held up by a single tether cable, it adds stress to the building frame. Another hurdle that manufacturers faced was safety. Since most airships are known to use hydrogen rather than helium, you would think hydrogen is the one to use. Unfortunately, hydrogen is a warning against fire because it is extremely flammable. So security was definitely another hurdle in trying to get airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. A final hurdle that builders faced was nature itself. This is simply because the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast, repeatedly because strong currents would constantly move the winds to the top of the building. There would be no solution, even if the airship was moored to the mooring mast. These are the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there, in the informative excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

When the Empire State Building was confronted with @ CAPS1 an airship docking station, they encountered many problems. The first @ CAPS2 encountered by @ CAPS3 was the wind. Wind over a thousand feet in the air will never be @ CAPS4. Once they brought the airship @ CAPS5 to the tower, they would no longer be able to keep it still enough to refuel and let passengers get on or off the airship. The second @ CAPS2 they encountered was that helium is flammable. If somehow that helium @ CAPS7 fired, it would be @ CAPS8 in a place like downtown New York. The third and final reason is that it is illegal to have a plane this low in a city. There was no way it would work, so they stopped moving forward on this @ CAPS9.

The @ ORGANIZATION1 arrow was originally designed to be more than just visibly stimulating. The spire was actually a mooring mast intended for mooring airships. Airships, or airships, were considered the means of transportation of the future, but the mast had many obstacles to overcome. Al Smith saw an opportunity to bring the Empire State Building and all of New York City to the forefront of modern travel. The mast had to support and support the weight of an airship, so "over sixty thousand dollars in structural modifications had to be made." The constant threat of the wind also made the plans too dangerous. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. These issues included safety, nature and an existing law. Security was the biggest obstacle. These airships "used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." @ CAPS1 the buildings of downtown New York are so close to each other that a building such as the Empire State Building that catches fire could have devastating effects. The most difficult problem to overcome would have been nature. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." It would have been impossible to prevent the rear of an airship from rotating. In addition, airships would be suspended above cars and people in the streets below. The last reason airships should not be docked at the Empire State Building was because of a law that prohibited "airships flying too low over urban areas." It made the whole plan illegal, and while it was a good plan, it wasn't well thought out.

Manufacturers have encountered many problems in trying to allow airships to dock. The biggest obstacle was the wind. At this altitude, the movement was constantly changing. If the airships were attached, the back would pivot. Another problem was that they couldn't weigh it down. Because it was high, if the airship was ballasted, it would fall.

Another obstacle was that the airships were held together by a single tether cable and this would add stress to the structure of the building. Next, New York City would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars on structural modifications. So the greatest reason for security came to them. That is, most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. And hydrogen is highly flammable. The @ DATE1, a German "Hindenburg" airship was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building realized if this was happening in New York City and how much of a problem it would be. The last and biggest obstacle they faced in successfully using the mooring mast was nature itself. Of all the strong winds and drafts, it would be difficult to tie the airships to the mast.

Also, the "roof had to be completed before the mooring mast framing could take place." @ CAPS1, they did not solve several other obstacles. Foreign airships "normally used hydrogen rather than helium ..." And it would cause enormous damage if they crashed into "a densely populated area like downtown New York." Also, being so high, the airship could not be ballasted aft and thus would pivot around the mast. There was also a law banning "airships flying too low over urban areas.

Allowing the airships to dock at the Empire State Building took a few hurdles. First, there was a lack of a suitable landing zone in New York City.

This would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling, service and let passengers get on and off. -Airship foot moored to the top of a building held by a single tether cable. To adapt to the situation, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be reinforced and modified.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock thousands of feet above the streets of New York City. One of their many problems was the size of the airships, somewhere as long as a thousand feet.

Usually, the backs of these airship-shaped structures were anchored by lead weights, but having lead weights suspended above the streets was far too risky if not impractical.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that they needed a mooring mast for the airships to anchor, but they couldn't drop a mooring mast onto the flat roof surface of the Empire State Building. . It would put too much pressure on the building. This problem cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle was the security measures. The airships were mostly filled with highly flammable hydrogen. If an airship caught fire, then the entire Empire State Building would be destroyed, including everyone inside. It was also not safe as strong, violent winds could blow and detach the airship, endangering pedestrians below. Another obstacle that manufacturers faced was the existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. If they tried to anchor an airship to the Empire State Building, that would be illegal. Due to all these hurdles that are not working, the whole idea is gone.

The architects, engineers and workers or the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when they tried to attach an airship dock to the top of the building. The first disturbing encounter for the builders was that they "couldn't just drop a mooring mast over the Empire State Building." Engineers and architects were to make repairs worth @ NUM1 dollars to strengthen the frame of the buildings. Mother Nature herself was also a problem. The constantly changing winds would make it difficult to stay ashore unless they were weighed down. Even weighing down the Zeppelins posed a threat of weight loss and death of an innocent person. finally, a law prevented airships from flying at low altitude over a city. If a point from another building hit and popped the ball, there would be absolute disaster. Overall, there were many obstacles preventing the idea of an airship dock from becoming a reality.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders encountered quite a few problems. They faced the construction of the building. They didn't know if they could build it all. They also faced a bad climate and had to wonder how much the airships weighed and if they could hold it.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with the mooring mast. First off, I would say security was the number one issue. If the airship caught fire, it could land in main streets of New York City, endangering hundreds of pedestrians. In addition, the weather was another factor. If there was too much wind to fly all the time then the mast would be a mess. When I read that they had to spend <@ NUM1 </ @ CAPS1> to modify the structure of the building, " I started to think about all the other things a city could do with @ MONEY1. also an existing law that made it illegal for all airships to be even remotely near the Empire State Building.

The Empire State Building's @ CAPS1 encountered many obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems was that @ CAPS1 had to fix the building frame in order to transmit the stress from the airship to the bottom of the building. Another obstacle that the @ CAPS1 faced was that the @ CAPS1 had to complete the roof before the mooring mast framing could take place. The Empire State Building @ CAPS1 also had to make sure that the mast skeleton was made of steel so that the mast would look like the rest of the Empire State Building and not protrude.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges and obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock with it, such as nature itself. At @ NUM1ft the winds were just too strong and unpredictable to approach and moor an airship. In addition to nature, laws prevented the disembarkation. Airships could not fly low over urban areas, so even attempting to approach the area would be illegal. This idea still posed a great potential danger even though there was no law against it and the wind did not exist. Many airships were made using hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In an area as populated as New York, if one were to catch fire, the damage would be horrendous.

Building a building was difficult, but attempting to build the tallest building in the world was intense. The mast on top of the Empire State Building caused many obstacles for builders such as reinforcing the framing of the entire building. "A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the Empire State Building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's structure." The architects also wanted to make the mooring mast ornamental, or decorative. "Rather than building a utility mast without any ornamentation, the architects' design is a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within." @ CAPS1, the building was to have two more floors added an "open observation deck" and a "boarding area for dirigidle passengers. Even though the mast was doomed never to serve its purpose, the building was still hailed as the tallest building in the world.

In the excerpt " The Mooring Mast ", by @ ORGANIZATION2, certain obstacles such as the support of the foundations, nature and safety called into question the construction of the docking station for airships. The first problem the architects faced was the moored airships which put too much pressure on the building. To combat this problem, drastic changes to the building should be made. "The Empire State Building's steel frame should be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1, @ CAPS2 @ NUM2) This change would have cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle that the builders faced during the construction of the mooring mast was nature. At this height, the wind currents are violent and unpredictable. Although attached to the building, the airships swirled and twisted around the mass, an unsafe and dangerous appearance. Finally, as the exception claims the main reason for failure, the mast safety violations were too severe. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen ... and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire ... the owners of the Empire State Building have realized how much worse this crash would have been… .over over a densely populated area like downtown New York. " (@ CAPS1 @ NUM3, @ CAPS2 @ NUM4) The moor posed a serious risk to the safety of New Yorkers. This problem served as a serious problem, thus serving as an obstacle for the builders of the mooring mass.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the drigibles to tie up to the building. Drigibles are huge steel-framed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium maneuvered with propellers and rudders. Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow drigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling or maintenance. But, the stress of the cart load and the wind pressure should be sent to the foundation of the buildings. This cost exceeds @ MONEY1 value of modifications to be made to the frame. On May 6, 1937, when the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, builders realized how catastrophic it would have been over the densely populated area of downtown New York. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the harsh and violent drafts, and the stern of the ship was constantly swaying. Additionally, current law prohibiting airships from flying too low over cities and towns would prohibit dredgers from mooring to the Empire State Building. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many hurdles in attempting to allow the drigibles to tie up to the building.

In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted some obstacles the Empire State Building encountered while attempting to allow airships to dock there, the winds were too strong and most used hydrogen instead. helium which is highly flammable. The way the airships docked to the building was by a rope attached to the mast. The airships would then be "suspended above pedestrians in the street". (@ NUM1). It was "neither practical nor safe" (@ NUM1) It would not only endanger pedestrians below but also people on airships. The wind was so strong he could throw it into a building. Most airships run on hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. "The German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."

. The Empire State Building during its construction was intended to serve as a mast, in which airships could be tethered. The builders of the building did not realize the gravity of the obstacles that prevented them from accomplishing this feat safely. Most of the issues presented were mostly security related. Due to safety concerns, the mast was considered lucrative and an idea, and posed too much danger. There were just too many possible opportunities for something to go wrong. One of those problems was that airships contain dangerous flammable gases, that if anything went wrong, a flaming airship falling into downtown New York would cause major damage. Another obstacle preventing this idea from becoming reality was that the airship attached to the mast would be "constantly moved due to strong drafts (para @ NUM1). Another reason why this could not be done" was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. "(para @ NUM2) Any problems that could not be plausibly solved were the reason the mast was unrealistic.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's Mooring Mast, the reason for the large spire was revealed as a mooring mast allowing zeppelins to land. the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many difficulties in getting the Zeppelins to land there. on the difficulty was the stress added by the weight of the airship "more @ NUM1 $ of work was done on the foundation. It was difficult because he thought that adding so much steel to a beautiful building could not not be easy. another addition of difficulty involved "the mast ... would have a conical head, this would house a mooring arm" think how easy it is to take an arrow decorated with @ NUM2 feet @ NUM3 feet towards the high, not easy. Last "the winds at the top were constantly moving because of the strong air currents", this means that all the structural workers went through hell to make the building.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was the pressure exerted on the framework of the buildings. Lüsted said: "A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building's framing. The stress of the airship's load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and reinforced to accommodate this new situation. If the Empire State Building were to succeed, they would have to change the frame. It was a major obstacle to Also one obstacle they would face was the safety of people. "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If they succeeded, there would always be a risk of someone catching fire. Making the Empire State Building a dock would have a lot of hurdles to overcome if they wanted this to happen.

Many obstacles faced the builders of the Empire State Building. The biggest problem is the fact that it was illegal for an airship to fly this low in urban areas, stated in paragraph @ NUM1. Another problem was that most of the airships in @ ORGANIZATION2 used hydrogen, which is very flammable. So if what happened to the Hindenburg happened to the Empire State Building, the accident would have been much worse. Especially with people walking the streets below, shown in paragraph @ NUM2. Another problem was nature. The winds were fierce at the top of the building and were always changing. So if an airship was moored to the mask and the lead weights that keep the airship from floating, like anchors, would be hanging over pedestrians ready to fall in an instant, as shown in paragraph @ NUM3. Additionally, fears of sharp edges and high winds would cause the airship to pierce and shatter.

During @ DATE1, airships were hailed as the transport of the future. Airships had a top speed of eighty miles an hour and sailed at about seventy miles an hour for thousands of miles. The main obstacle the Airships would face when landing in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Another hurdle that Empire State Architects and Builders faced was designing a mast that could allow the airship to dock with the building, as well as allow people to enter and exit. get out of the vehicle. The architects knew they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." the architects therefore had to reconstruct the foundations of the building to strengthen the structure of the building. The biggest obstacle that Empire State builders faced was nature itself. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." The strong air currents at the top of the Empire State Building would make it dangerous and dangerous to dock Airships in the building.

In this excerpt, Al Smith had many obstacles to overcome when he wanted the Airships to land on the Empire State Building. The smallest obstacle was to build this summit so that the airships could tie up to the building. "The summit would have cost Over @ ORGANIZATION1 for the necessary changes to the framework." Another obstacle encountered was the fact that there was an existing law in place @ CAPS1 this. "The other practical reason why Airships couldn't get to the Empire State Building anymore was an existing law against low-flying airships."

On December 11, 1929, Al Smith, governor of New York for four terms, announced that the Empire State Building would reach a height of 1,250 feet. At the time, it would be the tallest building in the world, but builders faced obstacles with the most distinctive part; allowing airships to dock there. First, it would be difficult to build a suitable landing zone. As described in paragraph @ NUM1 of the extract, an airship held by a single cable would add constraints to the structure of the building. Therefore, the steel frame should be modified and reinforced so that the additional stress is transmitted to the foundation of the building. In addition, security is a major issue. In paragraph @ NUM2, he said that "most airships outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." The builders realized that if one of the airships caught fire, like the German Hindenburg in New Jersey, it would cause huge problems due to the fact that New York is densely populated. Finally, nature itself is an obstacle for the builders. The winds at the top of the building are constantly moving due to a strong draft. As described in paragraph @ NUM3, the stern of the vessel would pivot and lead weights would be dangerous for pedestrians below. Overall the construction of the mast was difficult and will unfortunately never be used.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. The first problem, according to the excerpt, is that "a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the frame." They would need to spend more @ MONEY1 to modify the structure of the building. Another issue, of course, was the safety of the mast. Most zeppelins outside of the United States did not use helium. Instead, these members used hydrogen which is highly flammable and would have caused disaster if it had been set alight over a densely populated area like downtown New York. The excerpt also states that “ the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents. of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast. " @ CAPS1, there was already a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, it would be illegal for an airship to tie up or even to approach the Empire State Building For the reasons stated, the builders were not able to construct a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building had many problems trying to allow airships to dock at the top @ CAPS1 "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building . " @ CAPS2 the designers had to find a way for the airship to tie up to the top of the building. Even if they found a way to tie it down, "a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." This set the builders back because even if they found a way to dock the airship, the Empire State Building would need "over sixty thousand dollars in alterations." Even if it is possible, "there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas." The builders faced many obstacles that made them back down, but they made a valiant attempt to see their dream come true.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One example is that adding the airship would add stress to the building. The Empire State Building's frame would have to be altered due to the pressure that would be placed on the building. All the changes that would need to be made would add up to over sixty thousand dollars. Now there would also be 102 floors. The top floor would be the boarding area as well as an observation area. Another thing they had done for the mooring masts was hoist an American flag on top. All of these accommodations were designed for using airships moored atop the Empire State Building.

The designers of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to get airships to dock at its top. “ The biggest reason was security ” (para @ NUM1). Airships were dangerous. Strong winds could blow them in different directions, eventually hitting the building. And if there was an accident, debris would rain down on New York City. Since it was windy, they had to use lead weights to hold an airship in place. However, above the city it would be "neither practical nor safe" (para @ NUM2). Finally, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying at low altitudes over urban areas. This would make docking illegal. For these reasons, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges allowing airships, or airships, to dock on the building.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. An example would be taken from the excerpt where the author writes in paragraph 6 “ The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing pad. " This quote means that manufacturers were faced with the challenge of space to land the airship because New York was a relatively populated area. Another example would be in paragraph @ NUM1, when the author talks about security risks. Many airships used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flammable. A final example would be in paragraph @ NUM2 when the author describes the security risks. The builders had to take into account the strong winds at the top of the building.

There were many obstacles for mast builders trying to allow airships to dock, such as laws, nature, and overlooked details. The laws were a hindrance due to the safety risks of having an airship over a densely populated area, such as the Hindenburg crash.

Based on "The Mooring Mast", there were several obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. First of all, they couldn't just put a mast on top of the building as that would put too much pressure on the building frame. In addition, the stress would be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was 11 hundred feet below the mast. So before they could build anything, they had to reinforce the entire structure of the Empire State Building. Eventually those hurdles were fixed, but these are the hurdles that the builders set.

The obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow the airships to dock were very difficult. difficult. One difficulty they had was that the mooring mast itself was natural. When the airships arrived at the building, the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to the strong air current, and the only way for them to tie up was to weigh them in the back and use them in the back. Empire State Building. will not be practical or safe, with pedestrians below you. Another obstacle that the builders had was an existing law. the law prohibited airships flying low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel, or even to approach the area. it was an obstacle because they did not have much to do about it since it is a matter of the government which holds them back.

In the 1920s, airships were seen as the future of transportation. Although useful, the airships had a problem, there was not enough landing zone in New York. With that in mind, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building, he would build a mooring mast on top of the building. This would allow airships to dock there for several hours, refuel, and also allow passengers to get on and off. The addition of a mooring mast seemed proof in its own right at the time, but this new construction plan withstood many obstacles. The first hurdle was how to add a mooring mast without adding stress to the building frame. The architects detected that the stress of airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This led to the second obstacle which modified and reinforced the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the first obstacle. Finally the third obstacle, which was the expense. The modification of the new structure of the building would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Therefore, Al Smith saw a great opportunity for the Empire State Building, but he faced many obstacles.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The most influential obstacle was nature. According to the passage, "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving." This would make it difficult to dock the airships in the first place. If they even managed to dock, the stern of airships would shift and float. The only way to solve this problem would be to add weights to the rear of the airships. Then weights would float above the heads of pedestrians, which "was neither practical nor safe". At that time, there was a law prohibiting any type of aircraft from "flying too low over urban areas". As the passage states, “this law would make illegal a vessel that even moored to the vessel or even approached the area. @ CAPS1, the idea of the mooring mast has been abandoned.

The Builders @ CAPS1 encountered many problems when attempting to build an airship dock on the Empire State Building, which ranged from legal issues to structural and logistical issues. First, there was a law in place that prohibited airships from "flying too low over urban areas", as explained in paragraph @ NUM1. In addition to this legal problem, the builders @ CAPS1 the structural problem of laying a mooring mast on top of a skyscraper. According to the article, the stress of the airship load as well as the wind pressure should be transmitted over eleven hundred feet to the foundation. Due to this additional weight, modifications worth more than sixty thousand dollars were made to the building, as indicated in paragraph @ NUM2. In addition, the logistics of mooring an airship at such an altitude were quite difficult. In fact, half of the attempts to land airships at the Empire State Building were aborted due to high winds. Although an airship landing mast would have put the Empire State Building at the forefront of modern travel, this could not be done due to legal, structural and logistical issues.

Builders encountered multiple obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building. If the thousand-foot airship attempted to land on top of the Empire State Building, it would "add stress to the building structure" (paragraph @ NUM1). The building would then have to be modified to meet these needs. Nature has also played the role of a big obstacle. " The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents " (paragraph @ NUM2). If the airship attempted to land, the rear of it would pivot around and around the landing zone, creating a dangerous environment. Finally, the government also prevented airships from docking on the building. There was "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas" (paragraph @ NUM3). These three main reasons prevented airships from landing on top of the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced @ NUM1 major hurdles. A major problem was that they were using hydrogen which is highly flammable and they were in a very populated area.

Many obstacles were set up for workers, allowing airships to dock on the Empire State Building. At first they thought they knew what they were doing, they were wrong. The first obstacle for the workers was to secure the mooring to the Empire State Building. However, it was difficult to achieve this as it was above the civilians and if it ever fell, the resolution would be extremely serious. The second obstacle that hampered them was the wind pressure. This would have caused unreliable mast support which would screw up the mooring of the airship. Finally, the airship is the last piece of the puzzle along with the disaster. In the The Fate of the Mast section, it is stated that the airship runs on hydrogen which is extremely flammable. This sentence alone establishes that it is not safe for the environment. From a distance, many obstacles hampered the mast process. But the mooring was a whole different idea.

The Empire State Building had a flat roof, but they couldn't just drop the mooring mast on the roof, as that would add stress to the frame. To build a mooring mast, the cost would be over sixty thousand dollars. Building a mooring mast wouldn't be easy as the wind atop the Empire State Building would constantly change direction; so the airships would swirl around. Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted at the back with lead weights, but using these Empire State Buildings, where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor practical. safe.

Building the mast was intentionally a good idea, but the people who built it never really realized the real dangers of the idea as a whole. area, the ship had to sway when it was windy due to the lack of weight.

They must have realized that many other builders are going to try this concept, which means they have to lead by example. Otherwise, the other manufacturers would have big problems, people would be in danger. The builders and the men who thought of using weights to balance the weight of the ship.

According to @ ORGANIZATION2 @ NUM3, "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself".

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. A few of these obstacles are one, the stress of the load of the airship and the pressure of the wind. This happens because "the pressure of the wind should be transmitted to the foundations of the buildings," which means that they should descend almost eleven hundred feet below. Another obstacle is that they realized that "the Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose." The reason is that it should have been apparent before it was ever built. These are just a few of the many obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced.     

<START>

 

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were many issues related to security and money. Successfully mooring the airship would mean spending more than more @ MONEY1, to arrange for the building. In addition, there were many safety concerns such as the gas carried by the airship, the danger to people down in town, and it was illegal for airships to fly so low.

The Empire State Building faced some difficulties when trying to dock their airships. The builders tried to build a docking station for the airships, but the only problem they encountered was mooring securely thousands of feet in the air. The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Winds in New York would also make landing difficult. Another reason airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was laws on airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also dangerous. Most airships from the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German airship was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad it could have been in a densely populated area like New York City.        

<START>

 

The idea of the Empire State Building being used to moor airships may seem ludicrous now, but when it was built, that was the original purpose of the mast at the top. Of course, there are several reasons why this plan was unsuccessful. First, there was "a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas", which would make it impossible to legally attach an airship to a building. Additionally, strong air currents at the top of the building would cause a moored airship to swing uncontrollably, making it a safety hazard. Finally, many non-U.S. Airships used hydrogen to fly instead of helium, and if an airship were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous to civilians. These reasons lend credibility to the idea that the Empire State Building would not be a safe docking bay for airships.

According to the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building when attempting to dock airships in their building were that the foreign airships used highly flammable hydrogen on helium, the winds at top of the building were changing violently and it was illegal to fly too low over urban areas. First of all, foreign airships using hydrogen are very dangerous due to the high risk of them igniting. This only happened to the builders when a German airship Hindenburg caught fire on May 6, 1937. After this tragedy, they "realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had happened overhead. a densely populated area like downtown New York. " Had the incident occurred over New York City, many more lives would have been lost. More people would die, causing a bigger fiasco. In addition, the winds above the building are constantly changing, which would make the airship unstable. The article explains this effect by stating : “ Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. " The shifting winds would torture at the rear of the ship. The front would be secured with its tether, but the rear would be left free to sway and sway in the wind. Pedestrians below would be at high risk of danger, which would make this idea impractical. Finally, the law even forbade approaching the building, let alone mooring on it. The article puts it by saying: "... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas ... would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area. ... "The builders simply couldn't use the dock unless the law changed. The law was made to protect innocent pedestrians and passers-by, and flying the craft to the Empire State Building would violate said law. In conclusion, the three obstacles preventing the use of the Empire State Building were the hydrogen gas used in foreign airships, the unpredictable winds causing the craft to rotate, and the law prohibiting aircraft from flying too low over air. urban areas.

While the winch mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was a well thought out plan, it did pose a few hurdles for builders. The biggest issue was security. Most airships used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If an accident, such as a fire, were to happen at the Empire State's mooring mast, it wouldn't be safe to happen around millions of people like New York City. Another factor affecting the construction was nature. The above winds were constantly moving due to the currents. The only way to tie up airships would be to use weights, but it would also be extremely dangerous to be suspended over a city of people. The last problem was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low in urban areas. This law even prohibited ships from attempting to attach themselves to the vessel, which made the work of the builders almost impossible.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced big obstacles. One of the hurdles was that they had to make sure the airships could dock safely. They had to make sure that the passengers could get on and on safely. Finally, they had to make sure that the building did not collapse when they were making the mooring mast. These examples show that builders faced many obstacles when constructing the Empire State Building.

The building was not designed to support the added weight of having an airship strapped to the top. And airships had to have weights falling from the back to hold it in place, it wouldn't be very safe if lead weights were hanging NUM1 feet in the air. The mast was constructed of glass, which could have been dangerous if an airship could not stop and enter the tower directly. In addition, the electronic winching stations did not seem to work properly.

The Obstacles The Empire State Building's @ CAPS1 was a law that prohibited airships flying low over urban areas. Other issues the Empire State Building @ CAPS1 encountered were when the US Navy driigble in Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to get it. moor because of strong winds. The first obstacle the @ CAPS1 encountered in attempting to authorize the quai des drigibles was an "existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas". This law would make it illegal for a ship to fly up to a vessel. The second reason the builder ran into obstacles while attempting to allow the airship to dock was in 1930. enough to tie up because strong winds They @ CAPS3 wind would blow airships toward sharp arrows. the obstacles the Empire State Building @ CAPS1 encountered to allow docking.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. Al Smith (governor of New York for four terms who led the efforts to build the Empire State Building) was determined to rise above the height of the Chrysler Building "The architect who built the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve . " He built a 185ft boom and hoisted it to the top of the @ ORGANIZATION1 was determined to go over the top by placing a mooring mast on top of the building. "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." The winds would constantly move the mast. "But using them at the @ ORGANIZATION3, where they echoed above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe." Airships could not dock at the Empire State Building also due to a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for ships to tie up to the building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State bulding encountered obstacles when they allowed the airships to dock there.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow the airships to moor to the mooring mast at the top of the building. Perhaps the main problem was that foreign airships don't use helium, they use hydrogen. The use of hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If something went wrong, hypothetically, that an airship caught fire, it would pose a threat to New York City, which is heavily populated. If the airship exploded, New Yorkers wouldn't have enough time to escape the blast. Another problem was the winds. Winds can easily cause the airship to deviate from its course, or worse, into an arrow atop a building and pierce it. This problem was discovered when the US Navy airship "Los Angeles" attempted to reach the mooring mast. The captain was unable to approach the mast. These obstacles and dangers suggest that the mooring mast is a bad idea. What the builders did later.

In the article "Marcia Amidon's Mooring Mast @ CAPS1 the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire Building in trying to allow airships to dock there, a group of engineers here in New York are trying to boost a practical and workable arrangement and government Washington residents are looking for a safe way to moor airships to this mast. Architects could not simply lay a mooring mast on the flat roofs of Empire State buildings. An airship of a thousand feet moored to the top of the building held by a single tether, would add stress to the building frames. The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the buildings, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel framing of the Empire State Building would have to be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars of alterations had to be made to the frame of the building.

According to the excerpt, there are three reasons why the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow airships to dock there. These reasons were that it was too close to town and not up (short). The second reason is that the wind made the airship turn around the mast. And the third reason is that German airships were filled with hydrogen, if they were near the heat, they would explode. And the airships @ LOCATION1 were filled with helium.

When building the Empire State Building's airship dock, there were three major obstacles: wind, structure, and safety. Wind was the most obvious defect of the unloading dock due to the strong wind currents at the top of the building. Landing perfectly on the dock was one thing, but staying there was impossible because you would have been whipped. "[@ ORGANIZATION2 airship Los Angeles] was concerned that the wind would blow the airship at the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area, piercing the hull." (paragraph @ NUM1) The problem of structuring the mast to contain the balloon would also become a structural problem because "[they] couldn't just drop a mooring mast above the flat roof of the Empire State Building" (paragraph @ NUM2) get the structure strong enough to land an airship, they'd have to make sixty thousand dollars worth of frame modifications. flammable, was one of the reasons the mooring mast did not work. Although there were two landing attempts, neither succeeded, and now the mast is only there for decoration.

Builders and architects faced many challenges when completing this project to extend the Empire State Building to a height of 1,250 feet. Although they planned their steps to fabricate the mooring mast at the top, it was unrealistic. It was unrealistic as it had never been done before on top of a building. Another hurdle they faced was passenger safety and in general, because most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Another obstacle they faced was the weather, as landing an airship above the building with fast winds due to the strong air currents was also dangerous for people on the airships and could have struck another building rotating in the air. winds. The last hurdle that the builders faced was that their project was illegal, against federal law because airships would fly near urban areas such as New York, therefore impossible to achieve, as shown in paragraph @ NUM1. In this paragraph, it is stated that “ the Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose, for reasons which should have been apparent before it was constructed. This shows the teacher the inability of the project to be built.

In the end, it's obvious that the whole concept of Al @ ORGANIZATION1 on the Empire State Building was strategically flawed. It was Al Smith's dream, but the dream is not always reality. In theory, the Mooring @ ORGANIZATION3 would be built to moor dredges. However, it was eventually revealed that a docking station on the Empire State Building would never be possible. The reason Al Smith's dream could never come true is because Smith and the builders encountered so many obstacles. One of the obstacles encountered while building @ ORGANIZATION3 was the location. When a landing zone is 1250 feet above ground level, it is extremely difficult to test and complete a perfect landing zone, much more difficult than if it were at ground level. Also, with the location there is the security of having such high wind speeds at such an altitude. This is because the higher the altitude @ CAPS1, the more the atmospheric pressure and the "violent air currents" (@ CAPS2 @ NUM1) @ CAPS1 will have, creating a very dangerous environment. Then another aspect of the location was the fact that it was in the densely populated city of New York, if there were any mistakes a large number of casualties would be expected. Finally, a big hurdle that Smith and the builders faced was technology, in the @ DATE1 and the 1930s the amount of technology and engineering was certainly unprecedented with the technology prevalent in society today. .          

<START>

 

The hurdles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there are that Al Smith built an 185-foot spire inside the building to make it taller. By @ DATE1, the new airships called airships were hailed as a form of transportation for the future. They looked like airships but were filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter. In New York, they lacked a suitable landing zone for airships. Al Smith added a mooring mast to the top of the building so they could tie up the line from the front of the ship.

The Empire State Building's @ CAPS1 encountered many obstacles when attempting to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle was that a law stated that airships could not fly too low over cities, which meant they could not dock at the Empire State Building. Another obstacle was that foreign airships used hydrogen instead of helium to fly, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so using hydrogen airships in @ LOCATION1 would create public safety concerns. Finally, nature would turn out to be the biggest obstacle because of the wind, which could become quite violent and eventually cause the airships to detach from the building or fall. In conclusion, the Empire State Building's @ CAPS1 encountered many obstacles when attempting to allow airships to dock there.

The workers faced many obstacles in the process of building the mooring mast. The first reason was because of the strong winds. The winds blew the airships back and forth. It would be catastrophic if an accident happened. Second, the Law obstructed this idea. A law in New York was passed which prevented airships from flying over urban areas. The reasoning behind the law was because of a German airship accident in New Jersey. Finally, and probably the easiest, there was no clear way to land! The landing gear hadn't been invented yet, so trying to land was too risky. In conclusion, this idea was way ahead of its time, which is both good and bad in many ways.

The builders of @ ORGANIZATION2 face many obstacles. Al Smith realized he was on the verge of losing the title of tallest building in the world. The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone. A mooring mast was added to the top of the building that would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The airships were moored using an electric winch. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's frame. The Empire State Building's metal framework should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation. More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the frame of the building. The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted aft with lead weights. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area, even if two airships attempted to reach the building before the idea was scrapped. Fearing that the wind blows the airship on

The dream of the aviation pioneers to dock their airships on the Empire State Building created obstacles that manufacturers had to face. The mooring mast of the building "was destined never to fulfill its function", the author suggesting that the building should not have been built, because of all these obscured obstacles. One obstacle they encountered was the strong winds at the top of the building, due to drafts. It was difficult for the airships to land. The "four block" airship, filled with helium and hydrogen, would be suspended above, which was unsafe for the millions of people on the streets. In December 1930, the airship Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast because of the strong winds. Another obstacle that manufacturers faced was the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. The Columbia airship attempted to deliver bundles of newspapers to the building, ending up with papers hanging from the airship's rope, as the airship's mooring equipment was never installed. It was therefore "desirable to postpone until a later date that of the final installation of the landing gear" which gave airplanes the title of "transport of the future".

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered problems when docking the airships. Firstly, the height of the building makes capturing airships dangerous due to the structure of the tower @ CAPS1, If the airship were to crash it would fall on the streets of a big city.

The builders of The Mooring @ CAPS1 by @ ORGANIZATION2 face many obstacles when working to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. In order to ensure safety and to eliminate the problems involving the stress load and pressure of the airship on the building, the building would need to "be modified and reinforced to accommodate" the airships, and these modifications would cost up to sixty thousand dollars. Many airships were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flammable substance that could put the building and New York City in great danger if an airship were to explode. Because the winds "at the top of the building are constantly changing due to strong air currents," it was difficult to control airships and keep airships stationary to ensure passenger safety. There was also a law against the height of airships in urban areas. Using the mooring mast above the Empire State Building would be a violation of the law because the mast was too low. These difficult obstacles have proven to be too difficult to overcome. because the mast is not seriously used by airships.

It was very difficult for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow airships to dock there. They had to face many obstacles along the way. One obstacle was that they kept trying to raise the building. Al Smith was very competitive with the architect who built the Chrysler Building which was also in New York. Smith wanted it bigger and by extending it it became more dangerous and more difficult to allow docks up there. Another obstacle was the weather at the top of the building. The winds at this height were very harsh and with a heavily populated area they did not want an accident to happen. Allowing the docs on the Empire State Building was very dangerous.

New York is said to be "the city that never sleeps". New Yorkers are still awake, rushing through the streets. When the governor of four terms, Al Smith, wanted to install a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, the New Yorkers have been many concerns. With the people who built the building. These concerns were about laws, safety and construction. If a mooring mast were built, one law they would have to worry about would be to fly airships too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a vessel to immobilize the vessel or even to approach the area. Another major concern was security. These airships contained highly flammable hydrogen. If an airship caught fire over New York City, the damage could be tragic. The mast construction was out of the question as they had never planned to do it before starting the project Overall, the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building was never really meant to be created. .

After that, they would have to modify and strengthen the frame of the building to adapt to the new situation. The biggest obstacle throughout the process, however, was nature itself. Due to the strong drafts, the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing. Safety was a major hurdle Smith faced while constructing this building.

They encountered a lot of problems trying to tie up to it. It should never have been done in the first place. For a lot of things were predictable. They had no landing gear, the wind was too strong, and the ships could not get close enough to the mast to dock. They had no landing gear so it was difficult to stabilize and tie it down.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. The weight of the airship was held by a single tether cable which "must be transmitted to the foundation of the building", which lay well below. If the cable tie were to break, airship passengers and New York civilians would be in grave danger. This cable tie would be too risky to use. The builders could not overcome nature and its "violent drafts" for the winds they have at the top of the building. These currents would make the mooring potentially too long and dangerous. Builders and architects are trying to overcome this obstacle by weighing down "the back with lead weights". It was "neither practical nor safe," due to the potential danger of weights falling and hitting pedestrians in New York City.

Some of the hurdles that the builders threw in were that they had to make a lot of changes, such as they couldn't just drop a mast onto the flat roof of buildings.

Creating a mooring mast to sit on top of the Empire State Building that would work and allow airships to dock there was an incredibly difficult task for those who built the Empire State Building. Because the building was not originally designed to support the added weight and size of a mooring mast, the architects had to work to redesign the framing of the entire building. The architects changed the plans to reinforce the building's steel frame enough to withstand the added stress of a mooring mast. While the builders were able to solve this problem, many obstacles remained that could not be avoided. One of them was the danger of trying to control an airship. Airships were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen which threatened the safety of the citizens of the densely populated New York City. In addition, airships were traditionally weighted with lead when moored to prevent the airship from floating in the wind. This couldn't be done on the Empire State Building, as it would mean lead bricks would be constantly hanging over pedestrians. Besides all these practical obstacles, it was illegal for planes to fly over urban areas, and it was the last obstacle that prevented the use of the mooring mast.

There were many obstacles in the process of building the process of building a mooring mast. The designers must have thought they were far from them. It was easy to know you couldn't just go up to the top and start building. There were compromises to be made. The excerpt describes : " The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building ... " (@ CAPS1). Simply adding it would disrupt the structure and foundations of the buildings. Safety was a concern. People realized it was a bad idea to have something as highly flammable as the airship. “Most airships outside of the US used hydrogen instead of helium…” (@ CAPS1). After the recent fires, it was noticed that this idea is now dangerous. Control was a problem in the city; rather than an open field. "... the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast" (@ CAPS1). It wasn't going to "fly" with most people, it would be next to impossible to keep it @ CAPS4 for loaders. Designers face a lot of problems during the construction of buildings, but in this case, the mooring mast was simply not planned.

Unfortunately, the reality of successfully completing this faraway destination was slim, as problems gradually arose.

Al Smith had a vision; to create a modern travel site. Smith faced many obstacles and persisted in his efforts to try to bring his vision to life. The stress of a thousand-foot airship would have been too much of a strain on the Empire State Building's original frame. More than a value of @ MONEY1 had to be contributed to strengthen the framework of the buildings. In addition, the builders had designed a rocket-shaped mast, made of aluminum, which could accommodate the mooring arm, and the control machinery would be in the shaft; housing elevators and stairs for airship passengers. Another obstacle they faced was the lack of floors that would serve as a boarding area for passengers. They had started to build additional floors with a glass viewing area and a boarding area.

Another obstacle that the architects had to work with was the placement of the mooring mast on the building. So they had to add over sixty thousand dollars added to the frame of the building to make it strong for the mooring mast. Once the mooring mast was installed and they “celebrated the framing of the whole building,” another problem arose. the mooring mast.

As the builder's dream for the Empire State Building grew, so did the changes they needed to make. To begin with, they had to research and design a safe and convenient way to dock the airship. This was soon done with the help of the Navy and government research. The next struggle was the structure of the building. Adding a mast with the extra weight of airships and an engine room atop the skyscraper would affect the setting. In order for the building to be structurally sound, the frame was modified to withstand the additional stresses. Even with research and modifications, the mooring system was never put in place. The strong, changing winds above the Empire State Building did not allow an airship to dock safely, so the idea was quickly scrapped. Safety and wind were the two challenges that the builders could not overcome.

The obstacles encountered by the constructions of the Empire State Building were that they had to make it solid. They also had to make sure the airships didn't destroy the building when it landed. they also had to be careful that airships crash into the building when he drops the papers. Another obstacle for the workers was that the dredges could not land easily. Finally, they should make sure that nothing is out of place and functional.

The builders of the Empire States Building encountered many obstacles in the attempt to allow airships to dock on the building. Engineers realized from the start that even if they could dock an airship, it would put additional strain on the structure of the buildings. to solve this problem, they had to reinforce the whole building. On top of that, mooring an airship was inherently dangerous. It could easily be destroyed like the Hindenburg

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles including the construction of the mooring mast due to the height of the building. First, due to the presumed and projected height of the mast, there were concerns about how to evenly distribute the airship's weight. The structure of the airship and the fact that it was lighter than air was crucial to understand. With this in mind, the builders had to figure out how to get the whole building to support the weight of the airship and not just the top mast. If the airship had only been supported by the mast itself, the weight of the airship would likely have pulled the mast out of the building. Another obstacle encountered by builders was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. The mast was not made commercially, but rather extravagantly, with much of it being glass because of the many windows. This made the mast installation much more difficult as they had to monitor the mast installation from all areas. The builders encountered many obstacles to ensure that the Empire State Building was acceptable for mooring airships.

Faced with the prospect of building the tallest building in the world, Al Smith refused to give up. In order to achieve his goal, he decided to build an airship mooring mast on top of his new creation. But with this brilliant idea came obstacle after obstacle, preventing the idea from taking off. One of the obstacles Al Smith faced, and by far the most important, was security. Most non-US airships used hydrogen in their airships, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how bad it would have been if a flaming explosion had occurred "over a densely populated area like downtown New York." Another big obstacle was nature itself. " The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents ." This made it impossible to moor the airship without the stern of the ship circling the mooring mast.

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were issues of safety, nature itself, and the law. Safety was a big issue when it came to docking airships over populated areas such as New York City. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." After an accident in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that the accident would have been much worse if it had been in New York. Nature causes many obstacles in life, such as the wind which made it very difficult to moor a large airship. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship was moored to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would swirl." They would be hanging over people, which would not be safe. There is a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel." Two airships attempted to reach the building before the law was dropped. Safety, nature and the law kept Al @ CAPS1's dream from coming true. These were the hurdles that the builders faced when they tried to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building.

Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof. When they tried to build it there was not enough space so they tried to force it but @ CAPS1 messes everything up. "A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building held together by a single tether cable, with no strees to the building's frame." Sometimes when they try to add things that made the building only heavier and more likely to fall. They try to add more things to make it more beautiful, but what they didn't know was that it was just a gain to fall more.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted shares some of the obstacles that were overcome in trying to allow airships to land on top of the Empire State Building. Lüsted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws and construction in "The Mooring Mast". Nature has presented a huge setback in terms of mooring airships. As Lüsted writes, “even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast”. The safety of airships mooring on the Empire State Building has also become an issue. "The owners of the Empire State Building realized how" an accident could be worse if it happened over downtown New York City, rather than in a field. Laws in force at the time prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This law makes it impossible to dock an airship in New York. The construction of a mooring mast alone required "over @ NUM1 dollars in modifications" and a lot of time and planning. As Lüsted puts it, "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose." The obstacles presented in attempting to allow airships to land on the Empire State Building were too great and too numerous. The laws, safety, construction and nature of the day were too big a setback for this business.

There are a few hurdles that the Empire State Building builders face when trying to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle would be the construction of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated. Another reason is the @ CAPS1 law. There was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is definitely not the city for this idea just because there are a lot of people walking around @ CAPS2 and there are a lot of buildings around. This idea of mooring airships on the Empire State Building would @ CAPS3 put an end to the invention of airplanes. The @ CAPS4 idea has disappeared.

Al Smith's idea of expanding the Empire State Building was a very difficult task. It was also difficult to make the top of the building a mooring area for the new airships. One of the obstacles encountered by builders in attempting to create a dock for airships was to avoid constraints on the frame of buildings. If the builders wanted to fix that, it would involve the foundation of the building that was eleven hundred feet below. The frame of the building will be too expensive. The stress on the building will come from the load on the airships and the wind pressure. Another obstacle that the builders faced was the wind. The violent draft would cause the building to move constantly. They didn't want to use lead weights because it was too dangerous. because they were hanging high above the preloads. A law that builders had to think about during construction. It was the law that went against airships flying too low. They had many obstacles that builders had to keep in mind when building the wharf.

The main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were primarily safety and nature itself. safety was the most important, and because they were aiming to land airships above the building, they had to make sure it was completely safe. and hydrogen is flammable. " @ CAPS1 it's flammable, builders realized how dangerous it could be, especially in a densely populated area like New York. Besides safety, one of the biggest hurdles was nature. Having the mask docked at a steep height on top of the Empire State Building came with many difficulties related to the weather and the atmosphere. The winds at the top of the building were always changing, which made it difficult for the airships to land. Due to the unbearable air currents, nothing could be done about the airships. "Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot. around and around the mooring mast. ” Due to the roughness of the wind and the airship's non-idealistic design, safety and nature were the main obstacles to the creation of the Empire State Building.

Builders have encountered many problems with the @ CAPS1 airships docking to the Empire State Building. The first problem they encountered was the wind at the top of the building. When the Los Angeles Navy airship attempted to tie up to the building, the wind did not allow it to get close enough without going out of control, like hitting another building. This made it impossible to dock the airship, so the Los Angeles gave up. Another reason that the builders had a problem with the airships @ CAPS1 to dock on the Empire State Building, was that there was a law that said airships were not @ CAPS2 to fly low in the sky. above urban areas. This law would prevent all airships from approaching the building and, therefore, they would not be able to dock.

In @ ORGANIZATION1's The Mooring Mast, many entrepreneurs were extremely determined to build a mast on the Empire State Building to sanction the use of airships, or airships, as a means of airlift for the future. There were a lot of obstacles on how to make this a reality. Allowing airships to land on the Empire State Building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, turned out to be just an impossible theory. The first problem was the weight of the airship with the malevolent winds combined, ultimately breaking the beautiful frame of the building. “ The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. " The architects quickly solved this problem when they spend impulsively over sixty thousand dollars to change the building in order to remedy this defect, but it was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would fill these airships. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a major concern in a densely populated city like New York. The biggest obstacle was mother nature. "The winds at the top of the buildings were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." With airships flying over thousands of civilians, an unchecked plane due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was unrealistic was the law that prohibited airships from flying too low in urban areas. All of these obstacles made the construction of a mast on the Empire State Building a dream. Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, came up with some fascinating ideas. While they were great, they didn't work. Between the environment, the winds, the use of hydrogen and the safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles made it impossible to continue construction. Al Smith had an incredible imagination with bad luck.

In the article "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the mooring mast faced obstacles that hampered the successful mooring of airships. First, the architects had to design the mast. They knew that the Empire State Building's frame would have to be reinforced to withstand the load and wind pressure of the airship. Therefore, they “designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the skeleton of the buildings” and planned the reconstruction of the building and the mast. The workers were excited about their plans and ready to witness the start of a revolutionary moment. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced numerous roadblocks which prevented the plan from being completed. "Most airships ... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable," proving that the mooring mast was unsafe and could lead to potential accidents. In addition, "the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong air currents." Showing the ship's physical insecurity on the airship. Finally, the law sets restrictions on airships flying too low, and airships would violate this law. Even though the builders wanted to provide a launch pad for the airships and had an ideal design, there were too many flaws that made the mooring mast impossible to materialize. Obviously, there were a lot of issues that the builders faced that could not have been solved by trying to allow airships to dock.

The idea of a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building seemed like a big idea at the time of construction, but it had many hurdles to overcome. . this would strengthen the building against the pressure that a dock airship would create. Adding a mooring mast wouldn't be as simple as placing one on top of the building. The manufacturers therefore built a huge stainless steel enclosure to accommodate the passengers. this enclosure also had an elevator and stairs to bring passengers to the eighty-fifth floor. Finally, the builders had to complete the roof before framing the steel mast. The concept of a mooring mast was ingenious although the practicality quickly turned out to be extremely poor. Not to mention the fact that the builders were a thousand feet tall. this idea presented many challenges.        

<START>

 

The Empire State Building wanted to allow airships to dock at the top. To do this, a mast would have to be built at the top so that the airships could hang on and refuel. They encountered a lot of problems from the start and have continued to encounter them. The first problem, among many, was that they couldn't just drop a mast on top as that would be too unstable and put too much stress on the structure. To avoid this, they ended up modifying and strengthening the structure as a whole, which cost more than sixty thousand dollars. Once they figured out how to balance all the wind pressure, they had to think about how to bring the airships, the answer was simple electric winches. The next issue was security, the airships outside @ LOCATION1 were using highly flammable hydrogen and if that exploded it wouldn't be good for the densely populated town below. Another safety concern was the fiercely changing winds of nature and to solve the problem on the ground they would spread the back with lead weights to keep it from swaying, but doing this in the air over a lot of people could be dangerous. The final nail in the coffin of this plan was that there is a law for airships to fly too low over urban areas.

The obstacle the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there was the winds atop the Empire State Building. Indeed, in paragraph @ NUM1, it is indicated that "the building was constantly moving due to violent drafts". This problem would cause airships to rotate in the air. Another obstacle is that airships had is that it uses hydrogen and helium which is highly flammable.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, such as high winds and how they could tie up airships when it is illegal to fly an aircraft at low altitudes near urban areas. one of the hurdles that the builders faced was the safety of the airships anchored above the busy streets full of people and high winds. Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so any foreign airship that was anchored to the Empire State Building would pose a safety concern as the Strong winds at the top of the building could cause an accident to occur, causing the airship to explode and potentially endangering pedestrians. Another hurdle that builders faced was the law that prohibited airships from docking at the yard, as it was illegal for planes to fly at low altitudes near urban areas and it would have been a long process for the government never leaves them.

Builders faced so many obstacles to airships on the Empire State Building. One of the biggest obstacles was nature itself, as if the winds at the top of the building were shifting due to dangerous drafts.

The next problem was that most airships used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is flammable, and after the Hindenburg fire, people realized how potentially dangerous this idea of mooring was. Another problem was the weather. High winds could cause problems when airships attempt to dock. To top it off, that list of problems is the fact that there is a "law against airships flying too low over urban areas." @ CAPS1, there were just too many obstacles for the builders to overcome, and the mooring mast never succeeded.

The obstacles encountered by builders in attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building were serious. The biggest and most important obstacle they faced was security. If a plan isn't completely secure, it shouldn't happen. The Empire State Building would not have been stable enough with such strong winds. Additionally, most airships or airships used hydrogen, not helium, which would be extremely dangerous if the airship caught fire. Especially in a place as crowded as New York. This was another issue with an airship landing on the Empire State Building. Another obstacle was the wind. An airship couldn't land if it wasn't ballasted with lead weights, which was also not a bit safe for people walking freely in New York City. These issues are the reasons the airships were unable to land on the Empire State Building.

In an attempt to make the Empire State Building taller than the Chrysler Building, builders went through a few hurdles trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles was due to security reasons. Airships outside the United States used hydrogen, not helium. The hydrogen was more flammable, which led builders to realize that if an accident like when the German airship was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, it would be worse if it happened in a populated area like downtown New York. Known as one of the biggest obstacles in attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature. If the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the mooring mast would constantly move due to the winds above the building. The practical obstacle that the builders faced was the law. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Having to tie up the airship to the building would be illegal. But over the years, the idea of using the mooring mast died out, leaving no obstacles to tackle.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles to allow airships to dock there. The author said: "The biggest reason was security." Airships used hydrogen more often than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If an airship caught fire or crashed, it would be very dangerous over a populated area. Another obstacle was nature. The author wrote: " The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong air currents ". The wind would be too strong for an airship. One final reason as to why they couldn't dock was because it was against the law. The story said, "... was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."

The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature, a window on the top was constantly @ CAPS1 due to the corents of biolent air.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the workers who were building the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships or airships to dock there. At first, Al Smith, who was leading the Empire State Building efforts, was really trying to win "... the title of tallest building in the world ..." against the architect who built the Chrysler Building. Then Al Smith had an idea that would make his building more than @ NUM1 taller than the Chrysler building. Al Smith decided that he would add one to the building to serve as a mooring mast for the derigibles. "The Empire State Building should be modified and strengthened to adapt to this new situation." "more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made ...". "The Empire State Building architects and engineers consulted the experts ..." to make sure everything was safe and tidy. The builders went through such trouble and "The Empire State Building's mooring mast was destined never to serve its purpose ...". After so much work and effort, the mooring mast was never used because " the airships moored ... at the Empire State Building, where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street," was neither practical nor safe ”.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders had to face many obstacles in order for the airships to dock with it. The first obstacle was what the airships would attach themselves to. The builders believed that adding a mooring mast would make mooring easier, although they did not consider the foundation of the building. The builders realized that the foundation was not strong enough to accommodate airships, so over sixty thousand more dollars was spent to make it stronger. Manufacturers then had to think about how passengers got on board, as well as a place for luggage and ticketing. To solve this problem, a glazed viewing area and an open viewing platform were constructed. Another obstacle was the existing airship law regarding the height at which they could fly. The airships were clearly against this law and against the idea of using the mast for mooring. After unsuccessful docking attempts, the idea faded and the builders realized the plan would never work.        

<START>

 

The idea of turning the top of the Empire State Building into an airship @ CAPS1 had been a good idea, and would have helped solve the problem of not having an area large enough for the airship to land. However, there were flaws in the idea that were not discovered until the construction of the building was completed. One flaw was the strong air currents that kept the winds around the building in constant motion and would back the airship around and around until the rear of the airship eventually struck the building. The other flaw was that most airships were filled with a highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. If the airship had exploded and caught fire like the Hindenburg in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the flaming shell would fall on people around the building. Even if the flaws had been corrected, there was already a law that went against airships flying too low over urban areas and if airships were to land on the Empire States Building it would be considered illegal.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, builders encountered many obstacles to allow airships to dock with it. The initial problem was figuring out how to get the airship to the building. After consulting the Navy and meeting the president of the new "airship transport company". After that, they thought they had passed the difficult stage, but there were many obstacles ahead. Then, as they began to build the mass, they realized that with the height of the building, landing the airships "would add stress to the frame of the building." The framing of the building would have to be altered to help resolve these issues, and it cost @ MONEY1 more to make these changes. The previous two obstacles had been resolved, but the next group of obstacles caused the attempt of the airships to stop at the dock. Many safety issues posed as obstacles for the construction team. This could be very dangerous, as some gases used in airships are extremely flammable. Another obstacle is the ability to moor safely, at such high altitudes, with "ever-changing" air currents. All of these problems were magnified because it was even more dangerous for these problems to exist in such a populated area. The construction crew managed to overcome some obstacles, but there were some that caused too many potential issues to be solved.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. First of all, a lot of stress would be put on the framing of the building with a thousand foot airship standing on it, so builders would have to make a lot of changes to the framing of the building. "The Empire State Building's steel frame should be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation." @ CAPS1, safety was a primary reason airships were not allowed to dock there due to the highly flammable gas, hydrogen which is used in most airships. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been had it taken place in- above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. " @ CAPS2, nature was the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. Strong drafts caused shifting winds, causing the airship to rotate around the mooring mast, which was unsafe for pedestrians on the streets below. In conclusion, these obstacles prevented the Empire State Building's mooring mast from fulfilling its function.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock with it were nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents. Another hurdle would have to be that builders haven't checked city laws because an airplane can fly so low over urban areas such as New York City, so this law has prevented and made it illegal to a ship from mooring to the building or even approaching the area. The last hurdle the Empire State Building builders faced was public safety and that was the biggest reason. This project with the public in danger because if an airship fell in flames above a very populated city like New York it would be catastrophic! For example, the German airship Hindenburg did in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then the accident would be much worse and many people would die.

During the construction of the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face many difficulties and problems. They first had to make sure the airship didn't knock down the building's frame. Because the airship was so big and heavy, the airship added with the wind would be "transmitted to the foundation of the building" which was below. This had to be fixed, otherwise the building would have been destroyed. Even before that, workers had to learn how airships worked and how they could be moored on buildings. They "consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment" just to learn how an airship flies and how it would be docked. Probably the most important thing workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public. It was very difficult to do, and unfortunately it was not possible to build this mast so that it was safe for the public. This ultimately led to the mast never being used as a docking station.

The biggest obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there was nature itself.

Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted at the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe.

In the extract from "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders had to face many obstacles during the construction of the Empire State Building to be able to allow the mooring of the drigibles. Builders faced many obstacles such as the @ CAPS1 Changes laws and the @ CAPS2 building, which were overlooked while the idea was piling up. After creating the plan to add a mast to the top of the Empire State building a mooring for airships, the new airships finally decided to look at the flaws of the already developed plan. While designing the mask, the architects realized that it "couldn't just drop a mooring mast over the flat roof of the Empire States Building." "A 1,000-foot cart moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's framing." When the builders built their plan, they didn't take into account that loading the airships would add stress to the entire building. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." The builders realized that the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts and because the law prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas, the idea of airships would not be so easy. to achieve with all the obstacles to overcome.

The excerpt from "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, describes the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. For example, after the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, concerns that such an accident would occur in densely populated areas like New York City posed a problem, as most international airships used flammable hydrogen in the air. instead of helium. Another obstacle was the nature of the mooring mast and the strong air currents that cause wind changes. Having an airship docked atop the Empire State Building, “ hanging over pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe ” (paragraph @ NUM1). In addition, there were laws prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it "illegal for ships to tie up to the building or even approach the area" (paragraph @ NUM2). The project architects were so excited by the novelty of the idea that they were blind to these potential difficulties. These obstacles and unresolved issues contributed to the failure of the masses, and the idea faded and was forgotten.

The builders had to face many problems in allowing the drigibles to land on the Empire State Building. The builders had to be very careful or cautious when building the platform to allow the drigibles to tie up. Airships (Blimp) were very large transport machines made from steel and cotton cloth filled with hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a flammable substance that builders had to be careful of with power and power supplies. To allow an airship to dock above @ NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they must work on the building's framing so that there are bad weather conditions, the building does not would not collapse and would be stable. Due to all these problems, the precautions that the builders had to take, the manufacture of the mast was a failure and left for future transport in the plains.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. One obstacle they faced was rebuilding the building to add the mast. "The Empire State Building's steel frame should be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation." @ CAPS1 the mast was an obstacle they had to face. In addition, they had to face all the security requirements. "Was destined never to fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever built." After realizing what could go wrong if they docked airships, the mast's original purpose could not be fulfilled. Another hurdle they had to face was to test their airship docking plan. "The US Navy Los Angeles airship came close to the mooring mast but could not get close enough to moor." The airship failed in their attempt, and the idea of mooring the airships died out in the late 1930s. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles.

The architects of the Empire State Building faced many safety and practical hurdles in allowing airships to dock there. For example, the airships outside @ LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen gas is highly flammable. As a result, the German airship "Hindenburg" was destroyed by fire in 1937. The architects of the Empire State Building predicted that this could have been a much more tragic event if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. . In addition, anchoring an airship of @ NUM1 foot to the top of a building with a single tether would add stress to the structure of the building. In order to solve this problem, architects should make @ MONEY1 in modifications to the steel framing of the building. In addition, there are strong and unpredictable winds above the Empire State Building. If an airship were attached to the mast, it would rotate around the top of the building with the wind currents. When moored in open fields, airships can be anchored with weights. However, weighted anchors suspended over the heads of pedestrians could be potentially dangerous. In 1930, @ ORGANIZATION2's "Los Angeles" airship attempted to dock the Empire State Building, but was unable to get close enough to the spire to attach to it due to high winds. The pilot also had to maneuver around other arrows for fear of piercing the airship. Obviously, there were practical and safety reasons why the airship moor could not be completed on top of the Empire State Building.

Al Smith and his group of architects encountered many problems when they attempted to build a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to moor the airships. Before starting construction, the architects realized that they couldn't land an airship on the flat roofs of buildings. They must have made over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the frame before they thought of mooring airships there. After completing construction of the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that airships could never be docked to the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, the landing of airships was dangerous for the inhabitants of the city. The airships contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there were an accident like the Hindenburg in New York, the damage would be devastating. Nature has also prevented airships from docking with the Empire State Building; the air currents were too strong, and if the ship landed it would pivot around the ship's spire. It was possible to avoid this by placing lead weights in the back of the airship, but it was also dangerous for the people who lived below. The last hurdle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Although the architects had a great idea, they never understood why it would only work after construction.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in trying to allow the drigibles to moor there. For one thing, most tanks outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable, so it could explode. For example, on May 6, 1937, the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. There is nothing to predict that this could never happen again. The biggest obstacle to attempting to moor drigibles was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents and even though it was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship swiveled around the mooring mast. Dredges moored in open airstrips could be ballasted from the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the streets was impractical. nor sure. Another reason is that there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas, due to fear of the wind, blowing the cart towards other buildings in the area, which would pierce the hull of the cart and would cause a lot of damage.

In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ ORGANIZATION2 t the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow airships there. One example is “ Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. This means that you need to have a sturdy stand to hold an airship. Another is " Most airships from outside the United States use hydrogen, not helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." So if it caught fire in the middle of New York, that wouldn't be good. Another is that the changing wind speeds would cause the airship to sway in the air. This could cause stability issues. So, in this passage, The Mooring Mast of @ ORGANIZATION2 had to overcome obstacles and try to allow airships to dock there.

When something is invented or built, many obstacles are encountered. The number one barrier was security. Another problem was the wind atop the Empire State Building. The building itself was also a problem. All these problems and the architects tried to work around them and failed. Safety is important, if a person dies while traveling, no one will get on the balloon. Safety is important, no safety means no business. The wind was a big problem. If the balloon does not stay still during unloading, it is very dangerous. The skeleton of the building would have to change and that is an expensive solution. These are some of the main obstacles that architects have faced. Maybe one day they'll fix it.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring @ CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. one of the main issues was nature. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts," making it unsafe for the airship to circle around the building above pedestrians. Another obstacle that builders encountered was that airships used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the owners of the Empire State Building didn't want an airship catching fire above a "densely populated area like downtown New York." was the law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it “illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even approach the area”.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems when it came to airships. They were confronted with the problems of "... strong drafts" which circulate above the building. These constantly pushed the ships as they tried to dock and rocked the stern while they were moored. Another problem was that there was an "... existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." This would make it fundamentally illegal to dock an airship on the Empire State Building. These obstacles described in "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Lüsted show why the spire on top of the Empire State Building was never used to moor airships.

There were many obstacles that prevented airships from being able to dock there. The layout of how the mast would be used was not carefully thought out. One of the reasons is that airships have to use hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Due to the fact that the airship would be relatively close to pedestrians and other buildings, it would be unwise to use the mast. Additionally, there was a law stating that the airship could not fly low in urban areas, which it would do exactly if it was attached to the mast. Additionally, the force of the wind could spin the stern of the airship, causing it to rotate around the mast. The solution would be to put heavy blocks in the back that could cause it to fall on pedestrians. Overall, there were many reasons why it was unreasonable to allow airships to dock there.       

<START>

 

The obstacles encountered by the builders of the empire state building to allow airships to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that other airships outside of the United States were using hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which airships used in the United States. The owners didn't want anything like the German airship Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason airships encountered problems docking with the Empire State Building was that an existing law prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. For example, an @ ORGANIZATION1 airship named Los Angeles could not get close enough to dock due to high winds. These problems show that the owners of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in allowing airships to dock there.

The Empire State Building was designed to become the tallest building in the world, with a few tricks up its sleeve. The building was originally intended to function as a mooring mast for airships as well. Unfortunately, there were many problems in how to put this theory into reality. One of the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the use of dangerous gases in the balloons. “Most airships outside @ LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable.” The use of hydrogen posed a dangerous threat to the safety of civilians in New York City. Another problem with the building was the wind. "the stern of the ship swiveled around the mooring mast ... (the airships) hanging over pedestrians in the street was neither practical nor safe. A third problem, the builders There had been legality the issue of mooring ships in buildings. There was a law prohibiting aerial vessels from flying too low over urban areas. " With this law in place, it would have been impossible for ships to moor. . While the manufacturers have good intentions, they have not realized the reality of the situation.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered multiple obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. For example, as mentioned in paragraph @ NUM1, "a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building frame". The difficulty with having the stress of airship load and wind pressure is that it would have to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Wind was another obstacle that builders had to overcome. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. And even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast. Airships moored in open fields could be ballasted in the back with lead weights, but using the LED weights at the Empire State Building would not be safe, as they would swing well above pedestrians in the street.           

<START>

 

The construction of the mooring mast was not an easy task, there were many problems with creating this futuristic design. Some of the problems these builders faced were that airships can be up to a thousand feet long, so they are very heavy and sway dangerously in the wind, it was also illegal for airships to fly at low altitudes at- over urban areas, and there was also a great danger that the airship would crash or catch fire over the densely populated area of New York. Even though these issues seem almost impossible to fix, there are a few things they were able to fix to make the project more realistic. The Empire State Building's steel frame was altered and reinforced so that it could withstand the airships and the pressure of the wind, but nature had no mercy and would have vigorously rocked the airships, which was neither safe nor practical. They were able to get around the law and try to tie up once, which ultimately didn't work. There had already been cases of airship crashes like the Hindenburg. But an accident in a densely populated area would be horrible and impractical. Due to these issues and more, the idea of using a mooring mast to moor airships was completely withdrawn.

When the idea of an airship mooring dock @ CAPS1 on it seemed like a brilliant idea, but over time and construction obstacles to overcome made the idea of a dock to mooring remained an idea. When the mooring mast was completed, obvious safety hazards prevented it from fulfilling its purpose. The biggest danger @ CAPS2 was the nature of the mast itself. The winds at this height were strong, violent and constantly changing. Even if the airship was tied up, the stern of the ship would be wrapped around the mooring mast. Another danger was that most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. After the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized they couldn't take this @ CAPS3. A final hurdle that arose was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. this law even prohibited a ship from approaching the vessel.

The obstacles engineers faced were those of any builder @ CAPS1. You have to think about the height of the strong winds, the sturdiness of the frame, @ CAPS2 and the payroll of the engineers.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there.

"The other practical reason why airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." This symbolizes that it is illegal to have an airship near a heavily populated area. The idea of mooring airships to the Empire State Building was ignored.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many natural oppositions while trying to allow the derigibles to moor in the building. The forces of nature posed a complete threat to the idea of airships landing on the Empire State Building : " The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts ", which would not be safe for people entering and leaving. the airship because the ship would pivot around the mast in the morning. Another opposition to the idea was that most airships that came from outside the United States did not use helium, but hydrogen which is highly flammable and put the lives of people who lived around it at risk. The empire state building. Also the law was against this idea. There was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas.

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were that they needed to be modified and strengthened.

Another obstacle that the builders had faced was that the airships used hydrogen instead of helium, so the hydrogen was very flammable.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the airships to dock with the Empire State Building. @ PERSON1 says in the excerpt "The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone." This shows that in order for airships to dock atop the Empire State Building, there must be enough landing space. If a mooring mast were added to the top of the building, it would only allow airships to dock there for several hours, for refueling or service, and for getting passengers on and off. One of the other practical reasons airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. Nor could the architects simply lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the building. A thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, could add stress to the building's frame. Thus, the builders of the Empire State Building did not allow airships to dock atop their building. Also because of anything that could happen to the building.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when they attempted to allow the airships to dock on its mooring mast. A large airship moored at the top of the building would add tremendous stress to the building, and "over sixty thousand dollars in alterations" had to be made to deal with the stress. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the winds would rotate the stern of the ship around the mast. According to the article, airships could be ballasted to avoid this, but it is dangerous for pedestrians. There was also the problem of mooring airships that use hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. On May 6, 1937, a hydrogen airship was destroyed by fire and according to the excerpt, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that if the accident had happened in downtown New York, it would have made the densely populated area dangerous.

The workers who built the extravagant Empire State Building went through several obstacle courses. One of the obstacle courses having the airship sit on top of the building.

Since the Empire State Building was so high, the wind was terrible. The last hurdle they had to overcome was the gas they used inside the airships. If they used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance like German airships, it could have been bad.

While trying to dock airships to the Empire State Building, many problems were encountered. One problem encountered was in paragraph nine where it says, "A thousand foot airship at the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." If they were building the airship dock, they would have to reinforce the whole building so that it didn't collapse. Another problem encountered was that most airships used hydrogen, not helium. Therefore, since hydrogen is flammable, they could not take the risk of an airship exploding over a densely populated area. A more ******* problem was the weather, especially the wind, at @ NUM1 feet. The drafts were so violent that the airship swiveled around the mooring mast. Airships typically land in an open field where they could be anchored by lead. According to the excerpt, swinging over pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Finally, the most important issue was the law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @ NUM2, the law prohibited a vessel from mooring to the building or even approaching the area. Even across the dock the airship was a great idea, too many issues were conflicting with the mooring mast for it to be fully operational. On the plus side, it made the Empire State Building the tallest in the world.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow the airships to be docked there.

Another problem in the attempt to allow airships to dock there was the winds at the top of the building. The drafts were very strong this high. “Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast,” so it would not be safe for people on the city streets. Finally, city laws interfered with the mooring mast plan. The law said it was illegal for an airship to fly too low over urban areas. If the airship could dock on the mooring mast, it would be a violation of this law. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems and their plan never came to fruition.

The Empire State Building encountered various obstacles in an attempt to allow airships to dock there. What was most important was the danger posed by this ambitious plan. Airships from outside the @ LOCATION3 commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German airship destroyed in a fire, the owners of the Empire State Building saw the real dangers of an accident like this in downtown New York. Another obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. Winds at such a high altitude made berthing difficult. When moored, airships would have to hang over pedestrians, which was "neither practical nor safe". The current law banning low-flying airships in urban areas creates further problems. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast due to high winds, owners began to see the issues unresolved. By the end of the 1930s, the idea had "quietly disappeared".

According to the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the construction of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was hampered by many obstacles that the builders had to face. First of all, the stress of the airship's load and the pressure of the wind would damage the structure of the building. The builders solve this problem by making "more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications ... to the structure of the building" (page @ NUM1 paragraph @ NUM2). After the mast was built, two more obstacles appeared. First, most airships used hydrogen, which is very flammable. After the German airship Hindenburg is destroyed by fire, builders realize the danger of letting the same crash happen in the densely populated city of New York. The biggest obstacle of the mast was "nature itself". As the winds at the top of the building receded due to the drafts, the stern of the airship swiveled around the mast. Builders thought about using lead weights to solve this problem, but weights suspended over pedestrians on the street "were neither practical nor safe." The last and most obvious obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Although builders and owners were able to overcome the first hurdle given by building the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, future obstacles prevented the mooring mast from fulfilling its purpose.

The people who built the Empire State Building had a lot of trouble building it. The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the existence of a suitable landing zone.

Some of the @ CAPS1 that the builders of the Empire State Building faced while attempting to allow the airships to dock there is that they were tied up using an electric winch, which was aligned from the front. from the ship, then attached to the mast. In addition, the body of the airship could sway in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the airship by descending a gangway to an open observation deck.

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were related to cost and safety.

In order to build the Empire State Building, some of the workers had some problems during its construction. Engineers and architects first consulted the experts. The obstacles that the builders had to face were, one the height. It was a thousand feet away and it put stress on the framework of the buildings. The wind pressure also added stress to the thousand foot building. Another big obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly moving towards the strong air currents. Even when the mooring mast was tied or tied up, the stern part of the ship swayed from the wind. Ultimately, the author says or suggests that it was never meant to be built because of all the issues that came with it.

The future of mooring airships atop the Empire State Building became unrealistic when safety concerns were raised and testing did not go as planned. Some airships used hydrogen rather than helium which could be flammable.

Placing a dock in the heart of New York City risked the lives of too many passengers and citizens @ CAPS1. When the dock was in place atop the Empire State Building, two airships attempted to land, but both times it was unsuccessful. There were issues @ CAPS1 and the landing, one being the wind.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few major hurdles in an attempt to allow the airships to dock there at the top of the building. These three main obstacles were mast design and building modifications, safety and existing aircraft laws. The mast design was an obstacle as an airship moored to the mast would add stress to the building frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they had to deal with "over sixty thousand dollars in alterations" to do so. One of the other issues was, above all, security. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States which used helium. This was dangerous because hydrogen is flammable, and the owners of the building did not want the Hindenburg accident to repeat itself when a German airship was destroyed by fire. Additionally, an airship had to be ballasted or it circled around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard to pedestrians below. The last major obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was the existing law prohibiting airships from flying low over urban areas. It would be illegal for an airship to approach the area let alone attach to the building. These are three of the main hurdles that builders faced when building the Empire State Building and its mast. Design, safety and legal issues were all hurdles that got the better of the builders.           

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple security concerns. Because Al Smith wanted to build a building larger than the Chrysler Building, he decided to put an airship mooring mast on his own. The framing of the building had to be altered before construction of the mooring mast could begin, as simply putting it on the roof would stress the framing and cause it to fall. Another problem was the landing of the airships themselves. They could be weighed down when they were on level ground, but not above a building, there would be many people below who could be injured if something went wrong. There was even a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. The builders had to find their way there. The biggest obstacle seemed to be the safety of people.      

<START>

 

In the process of building the Empire State Building, the architects encountered many obstacles. One of the main obstacles was to make the foundation strong enough. Another was the wind factor. They had a lot of trouble building the Empire State Building. In order for the airships to dock with the Empire State Building, they had to reinforce the foundations of the whales. If an airship docked in front of the whale, the vessel would twist and sway. Another problem was the wind. wind blowing from another building would spin airships at high speed. Even though they faced many obstacles, they managed to complete the Empire State Building.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles when they attempted to add an airship docking station to the top of the building. As it says in paragraph @ NUM1, "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." The wind could cause a serious safety hazard by rotating the stern of the moored airship. Airships are also highly flammable. If an explosion like the one in the Hindenburg had taken place atop the Empire State Building, it would have been catastrophic. Attempting to tie up an airship to the top of the building was not only dangerous - it was illegal. There was "a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas." (paragraph @ NUM2) The fact that mooring an airship was illegal and extremely dangerous was not the only obstacle that manufacturers faced. It was also a difficult task. Manufacturers would need to learn new technologies to operate the system at the US Naval Air Base. After researching, builders figured out that they should beef up the frame. "Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame." (paragraph @ NUM3) The obstacles encountered by the builders turned out to be a sufficient reason never to use the mooring.            

<START>

 

In their attempts to try and build a platform for docked airships, the builders of the Empire State Building did not note a few difficulties. One would be the way passengers have one and get off airships. When anchoring to refuel and allow passengers to get on and off, the rear of the airship would constantly pivot, which could endanger passengers and possibly damage or destroy the airship. Another difficulty was the way the mast was constructed. It had a rocket-like design, so it was not possible for airships to land fully. If it had a platform-like design, instead of hovering, airships could land, which allowed for more stability.     

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock on the mooring mast. The builders had to consult with experts and make tours of the equipment used in the construction of the mooring masts, the service of land airships and a functional layout, and modify the building for the support of the mast. In view of the construction of the mast, the architects first visited the equipment at @ ORGANIZATION1. The builders also met with the president of an airship transport company that offered their services across the Pacific Ocean. A viable arrangement had to be created. It was difficult and tedious to imagine " a sure way to tie up ships to this mast ". The foundations of the building also had to be considered because "the architects could not just drop the mooring mast above the flat roof of the Empire State Building." More @ MONEY1 in modifications to the frame and foundation of the building had to be done. All of these obstacles prevented architects from building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles encountered by the architects was the frame of the building. They had to design the landing zone so that if an airship landed there it wouldn't add too much stress to the structure of the building. Another problem was load stress and wind pressure. In paragraph @ NUM1, the author says "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below", and that is why the load of the airship, and the wind pressure is a big problem. Finally, once the builders realized that they had to make various adjustments, also to strengthen the steel frame of the building, "over sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made", which is a lot of money ! These are the obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow airships to dock there.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles in order for the airships to dock safely at the top for refueling or repair. People were thrilled with the idea, but they knew how difficult it would be. First, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler Building builders' tactic of sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith wasn't going to let this happen, so he decided to make the @ CAPS1.SB even bigger. (1250ft) Second, the builders had to find a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as an obstacle because at such a height, the construction is difficult to do. Al Smith, however, was more than determined, which enlightened workers stated in paragraph @ NUM1, "over sixty thousand dollars" of modifications had to be made to the structure of the buildings (Lüsted, @ NUM1). In addition, the wharf or landing stage could not be used if weather conditions permitted. Airships so close to town, building, and civilians were dangerous when swaying. The author says that "some were up to a thousand feet long, the same length as four city blocks in New York" (6). There were strong wind currents that could cause the airships to sway around the mooring mast. Finally, an existing law against airships flying so low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being banned and breaking the law would get in trouble for many. Overall, the Empire State Building Architects' attempt proved their dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the Pier to be successful in society.

In the excerpt from "The @ CAPS1 Mast", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it was mentioned that architects face challenges when trying to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building. . In the snippet it says hydrogen is highly flammable @ CAPS2 if something goes wrong it could be a huge problem in a heavily populated area like New York. The main problem they faced was nature. He said "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts." The airship has the potential to turn around the mast and with all the pedestrians below it is very dangerous. These challenges are what led to the fate of the mooring mast not being used as originally intended.    

<START>

 

It's a shame that such a good idea never got off the ground. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties when they attempted to allow airships to dock on the building. They had to design the mask first, which seems like a long and complicated process. Everything seemed like it was going to work out. The builders started construction. After two months of construction, the mooring mast could not fulfill its function for several reasons. hydrogen is highly flammable and dangerous to use in such a populated area. Things like the wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible. There were laws that would never have allowed this to happen anyway. If builders and planners had done better research, they would have found this project impossible before going through all the intense construction.         

<START>

 

The first hurdle that can builders faced was the fact that the idea of the Empire State Building being New York's tallest building had been shattered. This caused them to subsequently face more obstacles as their plan expanded. When the design to build the plan was completed, they started to face more potential problems. The first being that it was not logical or probable to "leave a mooring mast above the flat roof of the Empire State Building" (line @ NUM1) Because, in this case, the amount of stress that 'it would induce on the frame would be monstrous, therefore, it was concluded that the stress should be transmitted through the foundation of the building, which, to the dismay of the builders, was 11 hundred feet lower. This resulted in a value of @ MONEY1 of changes to the foundation. Another obstacle encountered was the wind pressure. "Los Angeles approached the mooring mass but could not get close enough to moor because of the strong winds" (line @ NUM2)        

<START>

 

During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock. First, the dangers of allowing airships made outside of the United States. May's non-US airships were made of hydrogen which is much more flammable than US helium balloons. To avoid a repeat of the Lüsted States airship explosion, "the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the crash could have been if it had taken place over downtown Montreal. New York." @ CAPS1, the winds at the top of the building were too strong to attach an airship safely to the top. The author specifies: “Even if the airships were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot ... This shows that for the ship to be sufficiently still to be able to moor, it was dangerous. Finally, a law was passed making it impossible to fly close enough to the vessel to be able to moor. Marcia Amidon Lüsted says: “An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. " This illegal makes the opportunity to land a blimp on the Empire State Building.         

<START>

 

One of the obvious reasons is the height of it all. The strong and ever changing winds were a problem as it caused the stern of the airship to sway from side to side. Another problem was trying to stop the ship from swaying, they consulted by putting on lead weights, but hanging weights over pedestrians is not at all safe. Another reason was that it was illegal to fly planes too low to the ground. These are just a few of the reasons it wasn't going to work.    

<START>

 

Even starting to build the platform for the Empire State Building was a mistake. What at first seemed like a valid and realistic idea ended up being potentially horrible if it failed. One of the obstacles that manufacturers faced when attempting to dock airships was the law that did not allow airships to fly low over urban areas. It would even be illegal to have boats permanently above pedestrians. Another obstacle that they fased where the insecurity of it all. The winds at this height Are constantly different And could move the Airships. Having airships docked at the Empire State Building was potentially dangerous and illegal.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. One issue they had was when and if they landed to get an area for people to get on and off. they also had to enlarge the platform. When the airships landed it was because they needed more fuel @ CAPS1 it would only take a few hours for them to be stopped.   

<START>

 

During the construction of the Empire State Building, builders encounter many obstacles when trying to allow airships to dock with it. One of the hurdles was that builders couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." Another issue that workers faced is that they would have to change the entire building design to meet the mooring dock accommodations. The main reason the wharf didn't work was security. The author writes that "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium ...". All of these reasons explain why the mooring dock never saw the light of day atop the Empire State Building.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of those hurdles was that many airships coming from outside the United States use hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because "hydrogen is highly flammable" (para. @ NUM1). The mooring of airships using hydrogen instead of helium was found to be dangerous by German Hindenburg when it was destroyed in a fire, and if something like this happened over New York , the results would be horrible. A second obstacle encountered in allowing airships to dock with the Empire State Building was another safety concern. The point was raised that “ the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts ” (para. @ NUM2). This would make it dangerous for the passengers aboard the airship. A third obstacle encountered was the fact that there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over areas like New York. This law prohibited a vessel from mooring to the vessel or even approaching the area. "(para. @ NUM3). These are three hurdles the builders faced when trying to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building.

When designing the Empire State Building, architect Al Smith had in mind the idea of a futuristic airship trip. However, he encountered many obstacles while attempting to allow airships to dock in this giant building, as described in The Mooring Mast. Mooring an airship at the top " ... would add stress to the structure of the building ." In order to allow the airships to dock, Smith had to modify the structure of the building: transmit the pressure to the foundations. Smith also faced the problem of foreign balloons; most of which used highly flammable hydrogen, instead of helium. A fire caused by an airship moored to the Empire State Building would quickly spread to the city. Smith discovered that nature also caused problems. Due to the changing winds at the top of the building, "... the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast", @ CAPS1 pedestrians. Because of all these obstacles, the idea of an airship mooring was abandoned, but the mast remains today.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were as follows : 1) it was at a height of @ NUM1 feet, @ NUM2) how the passengers could get on and off, @ NUM3) takes a long time to slow down and @ NUM4), the building would be 102 stories high with an observation deck on the 101st floor and a boarding / observation deck on the 102nd floor for airship passengers. Some of the other major hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were so intense that it's hard to explain. These major obstacles were : 1) how to moor airships and @ NUM2) how many airships could moor to them at a time.

In the excerpt " The @ CAPS1 Mast ", by @ PERSON1, the architects of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the problems faced by the builders was that the airship did not have a landing zone. The architects concluded that they couldn't just drop a mast @ CAPS1 on top of their building as it would add stress to its frame, so they had to reinforce and modify it to make it work. Another obstacle. was the fact that most airships ran on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Builders realized how dangerous it could be, especially over a densely populated area like downtown New York. They also realized that nature itself was their biggest obstacle. The winds were constantly changing due to the strong air currents and they knew this idea was neither practical nor safe. Finally, there was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas, which would make their idea illegal and unsuccessful.

@ CAPS1 was seen as the future of transportation. Also known as airships, @ CAPS1 looked like balloons, except they were made of steel and had rubbers and propellers to keep them in control. These steel balloons can travel at eighty miles an hour. The main reason the Empire State Building couldn't dock them was that most @ CAPS1s outside of the United States use hydrogen instead of Hellium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and causes accidents.   

<START>

 

When construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was completed, builders began to face issues that should have been apparent from the start. Some of the problems encountered were that there is a law in the United States that prohibits planes from flying in or around cities and buildings. That meant they couldn't have the airships strapped to the mast anyway. The very strong and constantly changing weather and wind was also a problem as it would blow the airship all over the place, and it could not be weighed down with lead blocks like on land as it would not be safe to let them hang overhead. the city. The winds being mad, the airship (most filled with hydrogen) could be punctured and ignite while following people on the ground. These @ CAPS1 being among the more obvious problems some would think they would not have tried it, but these obstacles were never overcome and the mooring mast is still unused.

@ ORGANIZATION2's mooring mast talks about the Empire State Building and the expectations people had for it. In @ DATE1, it was announced that the Empire State Building will reach the height of 1,250 feet. The purpose of the selection is to show that there was another idea that the builders of the Empire State Building were trying to bring to life. Builders have encountered obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there, such as the building not being stable enough to support airships, the need to add framing, and the possible dangers of making this idea a reality. reality. "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure would add too much stress to the framing of the buildings." Because of this additional constraint " the steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced ". Then when an airship was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse it could have been in a place like downtown @ CAPS1. ”Good thing they did. did not get the idea.

In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. The mast was doomed before it started. The main reason the mast never worked was for safety. Hydrogen, in most airships, is highly flammable. If an accident were to happen, it would happen in downtown New York. "The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1) Nature itself was one of the biggest obstacles to the successful use of the mast. Strong drafts and horse winds made it difficult to pilot an airship near the building. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." (@ CAPS1 @ NUM2) The mooring mast was doomed before they started building it. The main reasons for its failure were drafts and safety. The airships were never able to land there.

While attempting to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. One of the obstacles they faced was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Al Smith believed that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, then airships could dock there to refuel and let passengers get on and off. than helium which was extremely flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building felt that it would not be safe for the airship to ignite with a densely populated area just below. The biggest obstacle encountered was the use of the mooring mast with nature itself. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." The owners of the Empire State Building believed that if something went wrong, the airship would swing above pedestrians on the street. It was very dangerous.

Many obstacles arose as the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow airships to dock there. The stress of the airships moored on the vessel would be too great. "The metal frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation." Another problem was that airships were highly flammable and in such a populated area of New York "it was neither practical nor safe". Laws prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas were against the idea, but two airships attempted to reach the building before the whole idea was scrapped.

Construction workers faced many obstacles in the construction of the Empire State Building. One of those obstacles was significant. Since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world, they had to make sure there was enough technology to do so. They also had to add seventeen more floras to the building, making it 102 floors instead of its original @ NUM1 floors. Another obstacle was his security concerns. Construction workers never reported any problems with the construction of the mooring mast. In paragraph @ NUM2, the author declares: “ The still unresolved problems of mooring aircraft to a fixed mass at such a height have made the postponement to a later date of the final installation of the landing gear descriptible. " The author is trying to say it in the design of the production of the mass mooring; “They overlooked some issues that cause them to postpone the final date. Due to these obstacles, the construction team managed to construct the tallest building, the Empire State Building.

The Empire State Building ran into obstacles as it attempted to allow airships, "huge steel-framed balloons" commonly known as airships, to dock there. One of the main problems was the pressure on the building from the airships. As stated in the excerpt The @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2, by @ ORGANIZATION2, "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundations of the buildings, which were nearly eleven hundred feet below. . " (paragraph @ NUM1). More than @ MONEY1 worth of modifications have been made to strengthen and adapt to this new situation of airships.

One of the hurdles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to license airships was that the stress of the mace and the airship and the pressure of the wind would all be transmitted to the foundations of the buildings. The frame of the building should be reinforced to adapt to the new situation. There were also security reasons. Since most states have used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is flammable. If something happened and the airship caught fire. The fire could destroy New York City because it is so densely populated. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. If the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the vessel would pivot around the mooring mast.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. When designing the mast, the architects were faced with issues such as wind pressure, safety and practicality. The frame was not strong enough to withstand the stresses and wind pressure caused by the load of the airship. The foundation of the building, which was about @ NUM1 feet lower, would have had to be reinforced and modified to be able to handle the movement of the airship attached by a single tether cable. Safety was the biggest hurdle that manufacturers faced. Most airships used hydrogen to make them lighter than air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable causing many dangers. As New York City is a heavily populated area, the fire hazard was too dangerous to take. Finally, instead of landing in open fields, airships should dock eleven hundred feet above the ground, in the words of Marcia Amidon Lüsted, "using these (airships) at the Empire State Building, where they would be hung over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. "       

<START>

 

There were three main obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in trying to allow airships to dock there, the densely populated area, strong drafts, and the existing airship law. First, most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Since the dock would be above downtown New York City, the risk of the dock exploding is higher due to the density. Second, nature was a big obstacle. There were a lot of winds at the top of the building and the wind currents were constantly changing violently, there was a gigantic fear that the airship would spin around and hit another building. Finally, the wharf could never allow a ship to be legally moored due to the existing airship law flying too low over urban areas. The airship would not be safe, and the whole idea would collapse. For these reasons or obstacles, many builders of the Empire State Building were faced in attempting to allow airships to dock with it.       

<START>

 

Architects had their hands full when building the Empire State Building extension. There were some hurdles @ CAPS1 that needed to be overcome when they started building, like making sure the airships were safe enough, also taking into account the constantly changing winds. These problems are part of the reason why the plans were damaged. Certain weather conditions played an important role in the safety procedures put in place. "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself." The winds would cause the ship to sway back and forth, which would be extremely dangerous. Another problem was that the foreign ships @ CAPS1 were running on hydrogen which is flammable and that would be a high risk. “The @ CAPS1 airships outside of the US used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.

The builders had to overcome many obstacles at @ CAPS1 to allow the airship to dock on the @ ORGANIZATION2. The first thing that got in the way of getting him to the top of the Empire State Building. They said that due to the wind it was very difficult to get the airship up there without it exploding. There was also the security of being up there. There was already a fire coming from another airship that caught fire. The gases inside are really flammable and that would be a very big problem. The last thing they had to consider was whether the airships were too low. The airship would explode. for all these reasons, they had to consider them at @ CAPS1 to authorize the airship on the Empire State Building.        

<START>

 

Docking the Empire State Building and holding the airships raised issues so significant for builders. Most of the problems lay in the idea of a mast, Al Smith knew that the mass would exert a lot of pressure on the frame of the building, another was the balloon itself, moreover most American airships were made of hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen made it much more dangerous in the crowded area of downtown New York City because hydrogen was much more flammable. a third obstacle was the winds, as "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong air currents" put it. It was also illegal to fly / hold or dock an aircraft so close to the ground. Docking and maintaining the airships at the Empire State Building led to many issues and problems, which made it difficult to achieve such an idea for such a tall building.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant hurdles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. For example, the architects had to solve the potential problem of the "existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas". This law would clearly prohibit and make "illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even to approach the area". The airships were designed to be "moored in open airstrips" and "could be ballasted at the back with lead weights, but use them at the Empire State Building, where they would be suspended above the airships. pedestrians on the street was neither convenient nor safe. " Another example of a barrier that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the potential risk to the safety of passengers and residents. The reason that airship landings were a potential threat to the entire population of New York City was that "most airships outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and l hydrogen is highly flammable ". The owners of the Empire State Building saw these potential risks "when the German airship" Hindenburg "was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey". Also, another obstacle to setting up a mooring mast among one of the tallest buildings in the world was " the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts ." Due to the unpredictable winds, the airship could sway and "spin around and around the mooring mast". The architects of the Empire State Building were threatened by the possible obstacles of building a mooring mast at the top of the building.           

<START>

 

Throughout the new The Mooring Mast, builders faced many obstacles to achieve their vision. For example, workers had to design a mast that would withstand “the stress of the airship load” (@ NUM1). It was stated that the cable at the top was unable to maintain the stress that the airship would produce, so engineers had to develop a new solution to evenly distribute the weight of the airship. It cost them time and money due to the massive height of the Empire State Building. the architects also had to do additional research to develop the mast. The workers visited the United States Naval Air Force base and met with the president of the airship company just to make sure the airships landed safely and securely. These obstacles had to be faced in order to produce their unrealistic dream.      

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building had many @ CAPS1s. One of those @ CAPS1 was trying to get the frame of the building to support the airship, "The stress of airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted to the frame." Another problem the manufacturers encountered was that there was a law prohibiting planes from descending this low, this was stated @ CAPS2 @ NUM1 "The other practical reason airships couldn't tie up to the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. " The biggest obstacle was nature itself. Strong winds that rose up high would have prevented the airships from mooring, "Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mast." These were the @ CAPS1 that the builders were faced with.

The Empire State Building was to be the tallest building ever. At the top, was to be an accessible docking station for airships called mooring masts. The idea of having a mooring mast above the Empire State Building resulted in the modification of the entire building. It cost over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the mooring mast. This project was the first of its kind and had many obstacles like modifications. Some of these obstacles included strong air currents and the constant change in wind direction at the top of the building. With the changes in the wind, the airship could rotate and strike the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution was to attach lead bricks to the tail of the airship like what is used in the fields when they land. While the bricks prevent the tail from moving, hanging them over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not spared. Ultimately, the idea of docking the airships on the Empire State Building was scrapped due to many issues that might arise.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles @ CAPS1 in allowing the Airships to dock. The most obvious was the height at which they would dock. Al Smith states that "Empire State would reach the height of @ NUM1 feet", @ CAPS1 Airships outside the United States were extremely flammable. If one of them caught fire while docked atop the Empire State Building, the results would have been catastrophic as it would occur over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was the wind. If the vessel were attached to the mast, the stern of the mast would constantly pivot. Using LED weights to secure the back would not be safe or practical. The last was a law that made it illegal to fly an airship too low over an urban area. No ships would be allowed to fly over downtown New York.

Al Smith encountered many obstacles in the design and construction of a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Most of the obstacles should have been completed before the mast was even built. One of the obvious obstacles was the constant changing of the wind. The rear of the airship would not be attached and therefore was swinging in the sky. Another obstacle would be the design of the mast. This was important because if it was poorly designed the mast would put stress on the building and could cause a lot of damage. There was also a law on airships flying too low in urban areas, New York being an urban area. One of the most dangerous reasons was that some airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. Al Smith and his architects should have understood and discussed these issues before building an unusable structure. If this had been discussed, a lot of time and money would have been saved.

In this excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. The first goal was to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building, but they overcame that with the desire to add a top or hat to the building. They then had to adjust to the new situation that further modifications had to be made so that the airship did not add stress to the building frame as the steel frame of the building could not withstand the load and stress. wind pressure that would transmit near @ NUM1 feet below. The biggest obstacle that led to the mast fate was the fact, since most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen which was highly flammable, and they could not have any accidents over downtown. from New York. Nature itself was the biggest obstacle because of the constant changing winds. Airships could be ballasted at the back with lead weights, but hanging them over pedestrians in the street was neither safe nor practical. There was also a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the obstacles that builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building.

Marcia Amidon Lüsted, author of "The Mooring Mast", highlights not only the security risks that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered in attempting to allow airships to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with the laws. and violations that solidified the failure of such transport. Normally airships would dock in open airstrips and then ballast to make sure they would stay @ CAPS1 motionless on the ground, but like the Empire builders @ CAPS1 Building are tempted to dock airships at NUM1 feet in the laws of the air, nature and airspace come into play. The Empire State Building towering to 102 floors was a feat in itself; the vision of airships moored at such a height by builders has been mutilated both by actual forces of nature and by legal disputes. The fact that airships would have to dock atop the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace at NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly changing due to violent air currents so powerful that even "the United States Navy airship Los Angeles ... could not approach enough to tie up. It was too strong of a safety hazard and to bet on an airship with non-cooperating winds. The most factual and practical problem that builders face when faced with the idea of Docking airships atop the Empire State Building was a violation of an airspace law. to fly too low over urban areas, ”meaning that legally it was potentially dangerous to the safety of steer and moor an airship so high in the air.Without certainty of success, the operation of mooring airships on the Empire State Building was discontinued in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building alright Couldn't build a @ NUM1ft skyscraper, the attempt to dock airships on the building failed mainly due to security risks.

In the excerpt, "The Mooring Mast", para. Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Al Smith wanted to make New York's tallest building. He had made the building very tall, 1,046 feet tall to be exact, but then the Empire State Building was enlarged, 1,250 feet. It was basically a competition to see who was going to have the tallest building in New York City. A mooring mast was placed at the top of each building for more height. However, the manufacturers did not take into account the balloons or airships that pass through the air. Airships are highly flammable, and if they come in contact with a mooring mast it could be destroyed, as before, "The German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937" . .. The mast could have caused enormous chaos in New York if it had damaged an airship passing through the air.      

<START>

 

The main reason was safety: Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle to using the mooring mast was nature itself. The top of the building was constantly moving due to the strong drafts  

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several problems while attempting to allow airships to dock there. For starters, the architects could not simply lay the mooring mast on the flat roof of the building. This was due to the fact that an airship held by a cable would add stress to the frame of the building. Although this was a hindrance, the architects spent more than @ MONEY1 on frame modifications to remedy the problem. Another major issue with the mooring mast idea was general safety. First of all, most foreign airships use hydrogen, compared to helium, to stay in the air. This problem was that hydrogen was highly flammable, and after the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, architects worried that the same accident could happen downtown @ LOCATION1. In addition, the idea of the mast turned out to be dangerous due to the strong wind currents. To avoid blowing, the airships needed lead weights, which could not be allowed to hang over the busy city streets. In conclusion, a final hurdle was a law that prevented airships from flying too low over an urban city. This made it legal to dock any airships or ******** in that area. These were the obstacles faced by architects.         

<START>

 

During the construction of the dock for airships. Al Smith could only think of a few obstacles that would arise. It turned out that there were more obstacles than expected. It was expected that the building could be knocked down by airships, as stated in paragraph @ NUM1, third sentence. One obstacle that was unknown until the mast was built was that the violent change in the wind caused the airships to wrap around the mast and hang weights behind it to prevent the winding was considered dangerous as stated in paragraph fourteen, second sentence to fourth. Another little-known issue was the "existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas" (paragraph @ NUM2, first sentence) as well as the fact that "most airships outside the United States used airship. hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @ NUM3, second sentence) The whole idea of a mooring mast was not well thought out.

Back in the days of @ DATE1, there were a lot of obstacles that came into play for architects to build an airship dock so they could land on top of the Empire State Building. The builders had to face situations with the weather conditions of this wharf. The Empire State Building was so high that " the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts ." The weather conditions above this 1,250-foot vessel made it difficult to dock the airships, making the result unsafe. Manufacturers also had to face the reality of "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas". with this law taking its action, it made it illegal for an airship to even attempt to land on these docks. The main concern of the obstacles that these builders construct this landing dock would be the strong winds that would occur. The winds were so powerful and strong that the airship would face " the sharp arrows of other buildings in the area, piercing the hull of the airship ." This meteorological obstacle was a huge struggle for these architects making the dock of these airships unsuccessful. The obstacles encountered during the construction of this wharf resulted in airships being "given to planes".

Based on the excerpt, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were, the only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone, also saw an opportunity for its Empire State Building to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building that would allow airships to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, or for let passengers get on and off. The airships were also moored with an electric winch, which ascended in line from the bow of the ship and then attached it to a mast. In conclusion, these are the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced, to allow the airships to be docked.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2, there were many difficult obstacles that the builders of @ ORGANIZATION1 were attempting to allow airships to dock there. Al Smith, the governor of New York for four terms, was determined to overtake the Chrysler Building by expanding the Empire State Building. He had objectives where the building "would be equipped for an era of transport which was then only the dream of the pioneers of aviation". The first obstacle involved their expanded use in New York City, which was the lack of a suitable landing zone. Al Smith, however, saw an opportunity to have a mooring mast added to the top of the building that would allow airships to dock there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers get on and off. ". Al Smith's ambitions to improve the height of the building encouraged him to overcome this obstacle. Another problem with this however, was in fact the construction of the mast which led to a new obstacle. Over sixty thousand dollars of modifications were made to the Empire State Building because they couldn't have a thousand foot airship docked at the top of the building. If the airship was held by a single tether cable, it would add stress to the frame of the building. Even though this was a hindrance, the modifications to the building fixed this problem, and the builders were able to create the mast. As the progress of the Empire State continued, more and more from d Difficulties arose, which made the goa for Al Smith much more distant. Not knowing the fate of the ma er mooring on the Empire State Building, the builders subsequently realized that the purpose of the mast had become obsolete. The issue here was mainly safety, that "most airships coming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." They noticed after the mast was built that it could have been a tragedy to have an airship in flames over the densely populated city. Another major obstacle that interfered with the attempt to dock airships over the Empire State was nature itself. It was stated that "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts". The builders knew that weighing down the back of an airship would be dangerous because of the pedestrians below. Even with all of these hurdles, the builders of the Empire State Building kept trying to get airships docked there, but over time the idea faded and they basically gave up on the project. Al Smith's goals remained unfinished due to difficult obstacles, but in the end he managed to establish the Empire State Building as the tallest in @ ORGANIZATION5.

extract from the extract The mooring mast where many obstacles were encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The first thing was security. And that indicates that hydrogen is used rather than helium, and that hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle to using the Mooring Mast @ CAPS1 was nature itself. the stern of the vessel would pivot around and around the mooring mast. They would be hung over pedestrians on the street, which was neither practical nor safe.

Obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there included safety concerns, nature issues, and a dilemma with a law. Safety was a major concern as many airships used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. An example of such an airship was the German Hindenburg, which caught fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. As the article "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted indicates, "the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area such as downtown New York ". @ CAPS1, nature was a big obstacle that the owners faced as the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. According to Lüsted, this would have "pivoted around the mooring mast" the rear of the airships, which would not have been "practical or safe". @ CAPS2, there were legal issues the builders were facing. At the time, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over populated areas. As the article notes, "This law would make it illegal for vessels to attach to the vessel or even approach the area." The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges of security, nature, and the law.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION1 encountered many problems with the attempt to allow airships to dock them. One problem was that the frame already built was not strong enough for a new airship mooring mast. A second problem is illustrated in the quote " The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts ... " (Lüsted para. @ NUM1). The weather at the height of the Empire State Building was throwing and moving the airships in a violent manner when attempting to dock. The strong winds even caused the threat of an airship blown in an arrow on a surrounding building, the threat is indicated in the quote "which would pierce the hull of airships" (Lüsted para @ NUM2). This is what could happen if an airship tried to attach itself to the building. Manufacturers have also been faced with laws regarding flying this low over an urban area. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of issues when trying to allow airships to access the building.

The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. The first obstacle they encountered was placing the mooring mast on the vessel. Lüsted says: “The architects couldn't just place a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building” (Lüsted @ NUM1). This meant that they had to build another structure to be able to place the mooring mast. The second hurdle they faced was preparing the vessel to moor the airships. Lüsted says: "A thousand foot airship moored at the top ... held by a single tether would add stress to the building frame (Lüsted @ NUM1). Airships would weigh down the building and therefore would have to find a way to The Architect would have “modified and reinforced the steel structure” so that any airship would dock in. These are the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they attempted to allow the airships to dock.     

<START>

 

The men who constructed the building did not give enough thought to the practicality of the new form. A major problem with airships landing there to refuel is the fact that they could explode. There had been an airship crash before and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York. "When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been had it taken place in- above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. " (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). Winds at the top of the building would also blow the rear end of the airship, and it is not safe to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians, and the airship would be too low. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." (¶ @ NUM2) "- the stern of the ship would swivel around and around -" (¶ @ NUM2) "Airships moored in open landing fields could be ballasted in the aft lead weights, but using them at the back. 'Empire State Building, where they would hang over pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. " (¶ @ NUM2) the architects should have thought better of their plan.

The builders encountered many obstacles when they attempted to dock airships to the Empire State Building. First of all, there was a big security issue. Many airships in foreign countries used helium instead of hydrogen; while helium is highly flammable, the airship could therefore explode. Second, the wind made mooring the airships very difficult. The winds were always changeable due to the strong air currents. Finally, there was already a law prohibiting airships from flying at low altitude over urban areas. So even if they fixed the other issues, it would still be illegal to tie up airships. These are some of the problems that manufacturers encountered when attempting to dock airships.

In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building ran into obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. The architects struggled to put the moor pole above the building. "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." The mooring mast would have stressed the vessel. Due to the stress of the load of the airship and the pressure of the wind, the entire building would have to be reinforced and modified, which cost more than sixty thousand dollars. So they build a tower in shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel. These were the obstacles to the manufacture of a mooring mast.

The obstacles that the builders encountered in allowing airships to dock there were that they wanted to put a mooring mast on the flat roofs of Empire State buildings, but the problem was that the stress of the ship's load. airship as well as the strong wind pressure had to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was about @ NUM1ft below. And as they had to, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be altered and reinforced to suit the situation. 

<START>

 

Some of the hurdles that the builders faced were that if they were to add the mooring mast, they would have to strengthen the integrity of the building. This is necessary because once the mast has passed to the wind, the pressure would have been transmitted to its foundation. More floors should be added to accommodate elevators and stairs to a ticket and baggage area. They had to find a way to tie the mooring mast to the foundation, which is almost @ NUM1 feet below.

In the clip, The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders encountered obstacles while attempting to allow the airship to dock with the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles that the builders encountered was that they had to modify the frame of the buildings in order to install the mooring mast. The builders had to modify the building because “a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building's frame. This was another hurdle that manufacturers faced. In addition, the mooring mast never fulfilled its role for safety reasons. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature The winds were constantly changing due to strong drafts. The idea was neither practical nor secure.

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many problems while trying to allow airships to dock on the mask. One obstacle involved dropping "a mooring mask above the flat roof of the Empire State Building" (paragraph @ NUM1). If they had done this, the mask would have added a great amount of stress to the foundation of the building. As a result, the Empire State Building's steel frame had to be altered and reinforced, but it was too expensive. Another obstacle is the use of hydrogen rather than helium in foreign airships. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if an airship were to accidentally catch fire, a lot of damage could be done. The biggest obstacle, however, was the strong wind atop the Empire State Building. Even if the airship were " attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot constantly " (paragraph @ NUM2). Using lead weights to anchor the airship down while " hanging over pedestrians in the street was neither practical nor safe " (paragraph @ NUM2). In conclusion, during the construction of the mast of the Empire State Building, architects and builders encountered many obstacles.

In the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. When constructing the Empire State Building, architects had to consider the height of the building and the mooring mast. They just couldn't put a large glass and chrome mooring mast on the building's flat roof. In addition, wind currents over a thousand feet high change rapidly. An extremely large airship sign at the top of the building "would add stress to the frame of the building." (@ NUM1) Architects should modify and strengthen its steel frame for building safety. These changes would cost over sixty thousand dollars. But alas, the Empire State Building's mooring mast never fulfilled its destiny due to these obstacles.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author describes the obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships (airships) to dock there. The original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing point for airships, also known as airships. In paragraph 6, the author states “ The only obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone.

The mooring mast of @ ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempts to allow airships, the transport of the future in @ DATE1, also known as airships for moor to the building. The biggest problem was how to operate the mast. The main obstacle to using the mooring mast was nature, as the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong and violent drafts, the stern of the airship would turn and turn around the mast even when it will be attached to the mast. It says in the snippet that airships moored in open airstrips can be ballasted using lead weights. Because these would be hanging over the people below it would be dangerous, just in case he fell. Additionally, builders cannot control nature, which makes that the most difficult. Another obstacle was the stress the building frame would receive if the airship was held by a single tether cable. Wind pressure and stress would have been too great for the foundation of the building. This was addressed by modifying the steel frame of the building to be stronger to prevent the building from collapsing. against airships flying too low over urban areas.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges and obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of their obstacles was that foreign airships used hydrogen and not helium to stay in the air. If it exploded over New York City, the damage and death rate would be catastrophic. A second obstacle they encountered was that the building elevation was @ CAPS1 high and there were strong wind currents. This makes it difficult for the Navy airship the Los Angeles to come @ CAPS2 from the docking station to the mooring mast. The last obstacle they faced was the fear of the airships heading towards @ CAPS2 another Spire building puncturing a hole in the airship, causing it to crash. The builders were faced with many obstacles such as the danger and high risk of a foreign airship trying to eventually explode because they are filled with hydrogen and not helium. Also, being at such a high altitude, the strong wind currents make it difficult for airships to get close enough to moor. Finally, the Airship Fear goes @ CAPS2 another Spire building puncturing a hole in the airship causing it to crash.

In the excerpt from "The Mooring Mast," the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when they attempted to allow airships to dock there. The designers had such big plans for the building that the reality was far away. One of the challenges they encountered was the safety of everyone. In the excerpt, they explain how "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (paragraph @ NUM1). The risk of the airship catching fire was very high. If it caught fire, it would not only harm the airship, but the buildings and people of New York City as well. Another obstacle that stood in the way was nature itself. No one could predict the weather and "the winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts" (paragraph @ NUM2). Airships couldn't fly close enough without the wind pushing them. Winds could cause the plane to fly into buildings, which could damage the airship's design. All in all, the challenges designers had to overcome to construct such a large building were just a practical dream that reality quickly shattered.

In the snippet, builders encountered many obstacles on how to secure airships to the top of the Empire State Building. The first problem they had was with the high winds. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts" (@ NUM1). This was a problem because the winds could crash airships into the building, releasing its gas. The second hurdle they faced was making the structure of the building strong enough to attach the airships. "The Empire State Building's metal framework should be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation" (@ NUM2). This was a problem because if they didn't strengthen the steel, the airships would weaken the structure of the building.

Another is " The steel frame of the Empire State Building should be modified and reinforced to adapt to the new situation ." Which means they should be wasting even more money. Then they later found out that they couldn't even do it, primarily for legal reasons. If they did, they would be in trouble with the justice system. Once they realized that I think they realized the project was a failure and said to the world "The still unresolved problems of mooring aerial vessels to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to also postpone final installation of the landing gear to a later date.

The design of a docking station was supposed to be a great achievement for New York City. Unfortunately, the builders encountered many obstacles in trying to make this incredible plan flourish. Many engineers did not think about the dangers and for "reasons that should have been apparent even before it was built" (@ CAPS1 @ NUM1). The biggest problem was security. The airships used a highly flammable gas, hydrogen, and if an incident like the Hindenburg were to happen again, it would be of immense danger to the densely populated city. Another obstacle was the winds atop the Empire State Building. The winds were constantly changing and the backs of the airships swayed constantly. There was also a law banning low-flying planes over urban areas. it was therefore illegal for a vessel to approach the area. The idea of a docking station was great, however, many obstacles weren't raised at the start of @ CAPS2 in planning so the Empire State Building never became a dock.

According to the excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1, the obstacles the Empire State Building builders faced in allowing airships to dock were, to make it work. For many reasons, builders would never get airships docked at the Empire State Building. One of the reasons this idea never could happen was that the airships themselves were highly flammable. The hydrogen gas used in most places to power airships made them highly flammable. In a densely populated area like New York, that would be a problem. Another problem would be money. The builders would need more money to strengthen the building for the weight of the airships. With a thousand foot airship moored to the top of a building by a single tether cable, there will be a lot of stress on the building. Finally, the last reason would be security. Strong winds would make airships unstable when docked to the vessel. There is also a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. In @ CAPS2 based on the extract The mooring mast ; by Marcia Amidon @ CAPS1 obstacles the Empire State Building builders encountered in attempting to allow airships to dock were flammability, money issues, and safety concerns.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges with airships. The first being that with the large size of the planes it would put a lot of stress on the building and therefore a new framework was created to accommodate the airships of @ NUM1 ft. Sixty thousand dollars were needed for the modifications. Another issue was security. Many airships outside the United States used hydrogen which is highly flammable and various accidents like in New Jersey, where the airship caught fire, were to occur in the densely populated city of New York, with many injuries and deaths would occur. A third reason is nature. As the building was so tall, the wind speed and pressure was very unpredictable, especially with the strong drafts. In open fields, weights were used to stabilize airships, but having lead weights " hanging high above pedestrians ... was neither practical nor safe ". @ CAPS1, there were laws against theft at certain altitudes in urban areas. With the Empire State Building at its height, it was still illegal to tie up an airship or other craft to it. These are obstacles that the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building.

The builders of the Empire State Building had to go through many hardships building the mooring mast and trying to moor airships to it. Some of the obstacles that the builders had to overcome were the weather, "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself" (paragraph @ NUM1). The winds at the top of the Empire State Building changed a lot due to the strong air currents, even if the airship was attached to the mast, the wind would push the stern all around the mast. Another hurdle that the builders had to overcome was that they were concerned that the lead weights that held the airship down would hang over the edge of the building, leaving it unsafe for pedestrians and for the pilot and passengers of the airship.

In the excerpt from @ CAPS1 "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. Airships, also known as airships, where during the Empire State Building era, and the most advanced form of @ CAPS2. The Empire State Building was erected to tie up airships and allow them to unload and reload passengers and refuel. While building builders realized that " the stress of airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of buildings ... eleven hundred feet below " (para. @ NUM1). Plans had to be made to support the building and the airships. Nature was also in conflict with the project. Lead weights would be used to land airships "where they would be hung over pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe". (para @ NUM2). Due to the high winds at the altitude, these weights would wobble the airship and its weights. The planes therefore also risked landing on "the pointed arrows of other buildings". (para @ NUM3). In addition, a law @ CAPS2 offers to "fly low in urban areas (para @ NUM3). For these reasons, the Empire State Building was never used for mooring airships.

When the Empire State Building was built, the world thought they knew the future of air travel: airships. In an attempt to keep up with the modern world, Al Smith, the lead architect of the Empire State Building, decided to top the building with the airship docking station. Unfortunately, during the construction process, the architects faced many obstacles that prevented them from completing the mooring mast. One of those problems with the sixty thousand dollars they would have to spend on modifications to the building. Another was the flammability of hydrogen, the gas used to inflate the ship. But the biggest obstacle was nature. The winds that the airship would face were very strong, and pedestrians on the sidewalk were endangered by the possibility of the ship tearing off the tether it was attached to and crashing. A final reason for the end of the mooring mast plan was a law that stated that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Although the mooring mast seemed like a great idea at the time, there were many obstacles that kept it from being successful.

The builders of the Empire State Building went through many obstacles. I feel bad for them because it was dangerous and how long they had to work. At the same time, I would have been happy to be a part of something like this. The builders could have died doing their job. Building it so high it must have been hot. I don't think it had to be so high that they could have done the same but lower. These are some of the hurdles that I think the manufacturers have gone through.      

<START>

 

There were a few challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. The mast could not simply be placed on top of the building. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building held together by a single tether cable would add stress to the structure of the building." All these constraints would be transmitted to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle was that the builders had to modify the whole building. The architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the skeleton of the building. The builders had already completed the building, but to dock the airships they had to change the building. These architects worked hard to build something that could never be used due to the strong drafts. "Even if the airships were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." The architects put all their work into remodeling the building for nothing.

In the clip of The Mooring Mast from @ PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. Their biggest concern was safety. "Most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (Lüsted, paragraph @ NUM1). The excerpt mentions the German airship, the Hindenburg, which was destroyed in a fire. "... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been had it taken place over a densely populated area like downtown New York" (Lüsted , paragraph @ NUM1). Another obstacle was nature itself. “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong air currents ” (Lüsted, paragraph @ NUM3). The unpredictable winds made it impossible to safely dock people on and off the airships. Finally, laws have been put in place to restrict airships flying too low over populated areas. "This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area" (Lüsted, paragraph @ NUM4).

While adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building is a very smart idea, there are multiple issues and concerns that accommodate this new functionality. For example, even if the cable were attached securely enough to the thousand foot airship, it would add stress to the frame of the building, weakening the building much faster than without it. In addition, to alter the significant effect of airships on the building, it would be necessary for the airship's weight and wind pressure to "be transmitted to the foundation of the building", which was almost impossible given that this distance was. greater than @ NUM1 the @ CAPS1, @ CAPS2 legs were an important factor in the construction of this futuristic structure ; more than sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to see better support the structure of the building

In attempting to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building, the builders encountered a few obstacles. One obstacle was an existing law on airships flying too low over urban areas like downtown New York. Another problem faced by the builders was the high winds that caused the stern of the airship to sway in the wind, making it unsafe for unloading passengers. Unlike airships moored in open fields, lead weights could not be used to weigh down the rear of the airship as they would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Another safety concern was that most balloons outside of the United States filled airships with hydrogen, which is much more flammable than helium. Airships filled with hydrogen could cause disaster if they caught fire. Although the idea seemed good at first, the builders of the Empire State Building realized that it was neither practical nor safe.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. A huge hurdle was that some airships were up to @ NUM1 feet, the same length as four blocks in New York. Another obstacle was the expanded use. New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone that they would have. With this, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his building. He would add an early morning mast to the top of the building that would allow passengers to get on and off, which would then become a place of supplies or service. But with this new idea, it would take a lot of planning.

The architects who built the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s, airships were seen as the means of transportation of the future. The idea of making a mast was not so far-fetched at first. As construction neared completion, many concerns arose. Many airships outside of the United States use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. Another problem was the mooring of the airships, with the winds on the Empire State Building moving constantly, forcing the stern of the airships to circle around the mooring mast. Finally, a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitude. When all the problems came together, the idea of mooring the airships quietly vanished.

In @ ORGANIZATION2's The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow airships to dock there. One of the main hurdles they had to overcome is that when the airships dock, it leaves stress on the building foundation. "More than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the framework of the buildings." Another obstacle that the builders had to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly changing direction. They thought about putting weights on the airships, but it wouldn't be safe to make them hang a thousand feet above people. There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to overcome.      

<START>

 

A mooring mast could simply be placed on top of the Empire State Building. If an airship over a thousand feet were to indebt the top of the building, held in place by a tether, then it would add stress to the structure of the building. The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure must be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which is eleven hundred feet below. The framework would have to be strengthened and modified, and it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Nature itself was the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The winds were changing because of the strong air currents on top of the building. The stern of an airship would pivot around and around the mooring mast. Lead weights ballasted the airships, but they wouldn't be safe in the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians underneath. These weights were used for open airstrips.                       

<START>

 

When the Empire State Building was built, they had problems letting airships dock there. Some reasons are that when airships were made they weren't made to go high. So when the Empire State Building was built, the airship had a slight problem. Most airships made in the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. But, hydrogen is very flammable.    

<START>

 

When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow airships to dock there, they encountered multiple obstacles. Most important was the issue of safety as the airship would cause chaos if it caught fire. The hydrogen would be too dangerous to be used in the airship if it could catch fire at any time. Another obstacle was the wind speed at the top of the Empire State Building. There were strong drafts, and these would shift the airship's position if it was moored to the mooring mast. Since the stern of the airship could not be weighed down for safety reasons, it swiveled around the mooring mast. The last problem was an existing airship law. They were not allowed to fly at this height because it was too close to an urban area. This made it illegal to attempt to dock with the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even get close to the area, with the exception of Los Angeles and Columbia, which were allowed to try before the idea was ruined. Neither of them was able to dock successfully, and the idea was over.        

<START>

 

From the excerpt from @ PERSON1's book "The Empire State Building", there seem to be two main issues with docking airships in New York City. First, it is the problem of nature itself. The area around the Empire State Building, and everything @ LOCATION3, is just too windy to have a safe docking procedure. The Los Angeles Naval @ CAPS1 attempted to dock, but the operator pulled away for fear of piercing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. The second problem, although slightly easier to rectify, was the law that prohibited all aircraft from near buildings in New York City. It even made any attempt at mooring illegal. There are plenty of reasons the idea for zeppelins didn't see the light of day around the world, and this New York snippet was a prime example of the hurdles that couldn't be safely overcome.      

<START>

 

In their attempts to allow airships to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. First, the Empire State Building's frame was too weak to support the added load of the airship. The builders sat down to strengthen the frame of the building, a feat of sixty thousand dollars. Second, the builders had to deal with strong and changing winds. These winds made mooring an airship nearly impossible, as "the stern of the ship would pivot around and around the mooring mast." Another obstacle encountered by manufacturers was safety concerns. The interiors of many airships were filled with hydrogen, a highly flammable gas that allowed the airship to float. After an airship fire in New Jersey, builders realized the dangers of airships and what would happen if an airship caught fire over New York City. Finally, manufacturers were also confronted with laws concerning air traffic. Laws prevented airships from flying " too low over urban areas ." Ultimately, obstacles prevented the builders from letting the airships dock on the Empire State Building.            

<START>

 

From the excerpt, it is clear that the builders of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building faced multiple issues. For starters, the excerpt indicates that airships in other countries were often filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. The danger of hydrogen was demonstrated when the German airship "Hindenburg" caught fire. The Hindenburg incident could have been much worse if it had happened in a densely populated area like New York. In addition to the Fire @ CAPS1 that the mooring mast would create, there was also a ban on low-flying planes, therefore in densely populated areas. According to the excerpt, however, the biggest obstacle was "nature itself". It was a reference to the mighty winds and fierce gusts found atop the Empire State Building. With these winds, it would be extremely difficult to control an airship safely. After realizing all these complications and obstacles, it was decided that the mooring mast would not be built.        

<START>

 

From what I learned from reading the excerpt " The Mooring Mast ", I learned that there are many obstacles to making room for airships at the dock. The most important reason is security. Since most airships used hydrogen instead of helium, airships were highly flammable. If the airships were to catch fire over New York City, many lives could be in danger. Another obstacle was the climate. The top of the Empire State buildings where they were going to build the mooring mast had such a bad climate that it was nearly impossible to moor an airship there. These are some of the many obstacles that architects had to face when designing the mooring mast.

Some of the hurdles the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there I also should have thought of @ CAPS1 a thousand foot airship @ CAPS2 from the top of the building could do to its structure . The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted an expert, leaving the folks at the US Naval Air Station for a tour of the equipment and the mooring mast. (Who is the anchor of the airship) Passengers on the airship could hop on and off by descending a gang plank to an open observation deck. In all, more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had to be made to the foundations of the buildings. And some airships couldn't even dock

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast excerpt, the builders encountered many obstacles while attempting to allow airships to dock above the Empire State Building. If the builders wanted to dock the airships, they couldn't because there wasn't a good area to land them. "... in New York was the lack of a suitable landing zone". Another obstacle was that they had to know the type of weather because nature itself can take control. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." The airships if they landed on the Empire State Building would be heavier because at the rear would cause weights therefore, it would weigh them down. Another reason this was an obstacle was because the airships used hydrogen gas rather than helium and hydrogen gas is a highly flammable gas that can do a lot of harm if there are passengers present in it. airships and could be very dangerous for the Empire. State building.

The Empire State Building's dream was to allow airships to dock there. It seemed like a great idea, but the builders had to face a lot of obstacles in trying to achieve the goal of mooring them there. The first problem they encountered was that the load of the airship and the pressure of the wind had to be transmitted to the foundation of the building so as not to stress the building frame. To do this, more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had been made. A tower in glass and chrome nickel steel was made with an illuminated interior. The building now had 102 floors. Even though all the hard work, the building was never used for mooring for safety reasons. One of the hurdles to safety was that the airships were highly flammable, after one caught fire in New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building didn't want it to be the same. in the densely populated city of New York. Another big obstacle was also caused by the terrible winds. Even though there was a landing sight, the airship could never be strapped in for passengers to get off. There was also a law which stated that planes could not fly at low altitudes to urban areas. Despite all the money and obstacles that the builders had to overcome to make this dream possible, it never came true.

During the construction process of the Empire State Building, the workers overcome countless obstacles. Al Smith, the governor of New York, wants to build "the tallest building in the world" (1). As the Empire State Building is being designed, the @ ORGANIZATION2 building, also in New York City, completes construction Construction workers @ ORGANIZATION2 decide they want to challenge the designers of the Empire State Building by secretly building a 185-foot spire and making their building 46 feet taller. This begins a competition between designers to see who will win the title of tallest building. Later, after the construction of the Empire State Building and obtaining the title of tallest building, workers try to make it work as a mast for land airships. Designers forgot to take into account the safety of landing an airship in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in making the plane land safely. The idea of the building serving as a landing for airships was abandoned. The empire state building ***************

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles encountered was making sure that the people below would not be injured.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to moor there. Some of these obstacles were not caused by the building itself, nature took part due to the high winds at a height of 1,250 feet, it was difficult for the airship pilots to steer the ship close enough to tie it down. This situation occurred at @ ORGANIZATION2's "Los Angeles" airship fearing the wind would blow the ship over sharp edges or other buildings in the area. The witch would cause the shell to puncture resulting in disaster, the captain failed to reach the building in December 1930. Another obstacle the builders encountered was that an existing law banning low-flying airships altitude above urban areas would put civilians on the streets at risk. Another obstacle was that an airship not large enough would put stress on the framework of the buildings.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. On the one hand, having airships suspended above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. There was also "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas." In addition to these obvious setbacks, "a thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." However, it is said to be safe that Mother Nature herself came up with the biggest hurdle for builders. “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents ,” which made it extremely difficult to keep the airships safely and securely up to the building. Obstacles for builders also became much more dangerous when they began to understand the science of airships. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." When the German airship "Hindenburg" caught fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners and builders of the Empire State Building realized that the accident could have been much worse had it occurred in summit of one of the most populous cities. in the world.

The people trying to get the airships to dock at the Empire State encountered many obstacles. They would first have to modify and strengthen the framework of the buildings to adapt to this new situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within, with a recessed design that mimicked the general shape of the building itself. After doing all of this work, they found out that the Empire State Building's mast would never work. The biggest reason was security. Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. The other practical reason airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. The law prohibited a vessel from docking with the vessel or even approaching the area. By the end of the 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for airships and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Airships, instead of becoming the transports of the future, had given way to airplanes.           

<START>

 

There were many issues with the airships docking to the Empire State Building that engineers ignored. While the architects were designing the mast, they realized that the building was not built to withstand the stresses of airships and wind. "... modifications had to be made" (paragraph @ NUM1). While these obstacles could be overcome, many others were not. Since most airships besides the @ PERSON1 used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, an airship could ignite like the German Hindenburg, and "the owners ... realized how bad this accident could have been. be worse ... above .... New York "(paragraph @ NUM2). Another obstacle was a problem with a "law against airships flying too low over urban areas" (paragraph @ NUM3). No airship would be allowed even near the building ; however, two tried anyway, but neither was able to securely attach to the building. The idea of transportation of the future has shifted to airplanes, and the upper floors of the Empire State Building are now a public tourist spot.

Obstacles encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow airships to dock there were due to the airships being moored by means of an electric winch, which pulled in line from the front. from the ship, then tied it to a mast. architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building's flat roof.

There were many obstacles in the way of adding a mooring dock to the top of the Empire State Building. Firstly, many modifications had to be made to the frame of the building. Indeed, the previous frame could not support the additional weight of an airship @ NUM1 suspended from 1 cable. These additions would take "1 in sixty thousand dollars" plus additional time and effort. Another big issue was security. The winds around New York "were constantly changing due to strong drafts." This would lead to the airship getting wrapped around the tower and eventually breaking or worse. Not to mention that all around was a densely populated city and any accident could cause much more destruction than normal. The Forgein airships also used massive amounts of hydrogen, which, proven to Hindenburg, could explode into a huge dunk of flaming steel. This chance would be amplified with the weather and any accident would have high human and property costs. Finally, it was illegal for airships to fly low near a city, which made the whole project illegal. As you can see, having an airship mooring center on the Empire State Building poses a lot of problems.

Obstacles are encountered every day, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even more difficult challenges in attempting to allow airships to dock on the building. The reasons why the airship could not dock there were obvious. Most airships use hydrogen, a very flammable element, to float. If an airship caught fire over a densely populated area like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develop. Another obstacle that had to be faced was nature. The winds were constantly shifting due to the strong air currents rotating the stern of the ship around the mooring mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the stern of the ship, but hanging these weights over pedestrians is very dangerous. Additionally, there is a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for an airship to attach to the building. The idea of making a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a clever idea, but obviously it was impossible.

In the article " The Mooring Mast " by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it is evident that the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when attempting to dock the airships. The airships themselves could be a danger. " ... Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." York. In addition, the light mass of airships would make them a target for strong and violent winds. This reality has raised fears that a zeppelin could be thrown into some sort of arrow at another building, causing it to suffer a hole in its fragile skin. The law also caused obstacles for mooring airships on the Empire State Building "... airships could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over areas urban. " This law thwarted many potential attempts to dock the latter. Mooring airships was a dream we talked about on "The Mooring Mast", but soon never had the chance to come true.

The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were that first, the pole designed to go over the Empire State Building was designed just to make it the tallest building in the world, not because it was necessary, so a lot of problems arose. This mast was designed to be an airship docking station, which at the time airships were very dangerous, and lacked a proper landing zone so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place of anchorage for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers get on and off. A mooring mast could not be simply laid on top, as it would add stress to the framing of the building, so the steel framing had to be altered, and it cost over sixty thousand dollars to do so. After construction, it was decided that if an incident like the Hindenburg happened again, it would be much worse in a densely populated area like downtown New York. But the biggest obstacle was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing, due to strong drafts, and although attached to the mast, the stern of the ship swiveled, the use of weights lead could solve this problem, but because they would be hung over pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. There was also a law prohibiting naval aircraft from flying too low over urban areas.

While building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, a number of hurdles have kept this theory from coming true. Builders and architects had to completely change the frame of the building to accommodate the weight of the mast, and it cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another problem was that most airships outside of @ LOCATION1 use hydrogen over helium, which was very flammable, and if an airship suffered the same fate as the Hindenburg it would cause a much bigger crash on the plane. ground level. The biggest challenge the mast faced was the constant shifting of winds from strong air currents. This caused the stern of the ship to pivot around the mast, even when attached to it, causing a problem. More importantly, there was already a law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the airship to approach the building, let alone attach to it. Although the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea, this feat could not be accomplished due to the obstacles.

The @ CAPS1 of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles in order to have an airship dock on the Empire State Building. They needed to build a mooring mast so that the airship could dock on the building. This presented another problem, however, because if the airship was moored to the building, it would weigh too much for the building. They overcame this obstacle by strengthening the supports of the building. The biggest obstacle and the one that thwarted that idea of docking an airship on the Empire State Building were simply the elements. Strong drafts and high winds made it impossible for an airship to attach itself securely to the top of the empire edifice. For example, when the airship @ ORGANIZATION2 Los @ CAPS2 tried to get within range of the mooring mast but could not, due to high winds. In the end, the @ CAPS1 of the Empire State Building could not overcome the obstacles.

New York-based architects went to great lengths to build a successful mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, moor airships for several hours for refueling or service, and allow passengers to board and get off the airship. During the construction, the architects faced difficult obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast opening and becoming usable. An airship moored to the top of the Empire State Building held by a single tether cable would put stress on the building's frame. The weight and pressure of the wind should be transferred to the foundation of the buildings. About more than @ MONEY1 of modifications should be made to the frame of the buildings. Another obstacle was the roof. "When the building was framed up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be finished before the mooring mast framing could take place," @ PERSON1 wrote in his post "The Mooring Mast". The biggest obstacle, however, was nature itself. Strong drafts caused the winds to change constantly, causing the airship to pivot around the mooring mast. The only solution would be to weigh down the rear of the machine with lead weights, but the risk was too great. Last but not least, there was a New York line of airships flying low over urban areas. The law even prohibited an airship from approaching the Empire State Building. Due to the inability to use the mooring mast for parked airships, the reserved rooms were turned into the tallest soda fountain in the world and a tea garden for tourists and tourists alike. By the late 1930s, airships had become a means of transportation of the past, and planes had made their way to the front of the crowds.

Constructing just one building is a huge job for builders, and then adding a mooring mast for airships makes the job much more difficult. Architects and builders had to consult with experts to find out how this construction should go and whether it was safe or not. Architects and builders had to tour the equipment and docking operations at US Naval Air Station Lakehurst, @ CAPS1 and also had to meet with the president of an airship transport company. Intense planning and many meetings later they would start building this mooring mast. When it came to the building, the construction workers couldn't just lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building, they had to find another way, they didn't want to put stress on the frame. buildings. They came to the conclusion that the structure of the building had to be modified requiring more than sixty thousand dollars. The workers had to add the mast, then the construction was hauled away due to the danger of pedestrians, all this work for nothing.

The builders of the Empire State Building were @ CAPS1 with immediate problems when attempting to allow airships to dock there. The media difficulties that they @ CAPS1 were placing a mooring mast on top of an already completed building. "A thousand foot airship ... would add stress to the structure of the building." (¶ @ NUM1) Not to mention that a big airship would also have put the building to the test. Carrying out such a project would be extremely difficult because the building was not designed for mooring airships. This means that the roof and upper floors would have to be converted to accommodate passengers and travel operations. Nature was also an obstacle that the builders @ CAPS1. Strong winds could cause the airship to sway violently. The weights used to tie up airships could also be a safety hazard in a densley populated area such as @ LOCATION1. Fire was another safety concern for builders. The gases used to keep airships airborne were highly flammable and would again pose serious safety concerns for a city of millions of people. In the end, all of these factors caused the creation of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to fail.

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. One of the obstacles that the builders faced was the winds at the top of the building. The winds were constantly changing due to strong air currents. Even though the airship was moored to the mooring weight, the ship circled around the mooring weight. This would make it dangerous for pedestrians. Another issue with the airships landing on the Empire State Building was safety. Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German Hindenburg airship was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, the owners of @ LOCATION3 in the Empire State Building realized the crash would be much worse in downtown New York.

During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders encountered many obstacles. One of the first obstacles encountered was competition. New York Governor Al Smith was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler Building which was also under construction. This created an obstacle as it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to create such a miraculous and tall building. of the building itself. "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the structure of the building." More than one value of @ MONEY1 had to be made to the frame. The last hurdle was all the work done in the mooring mast so that it could even work. It was dangerous for airships to land there. The airships were highly flammable. The winds were strong and dangerous, and there was a law prohibiting planes from flying so low.

The builders of the Empire State had to face many obstacles while trying to build it. Some of these obstacles were that a thousand-foot airship moored atop the building held by a single table would add stress to the base of fame. In addition, the wind at the top of the building was constantly changing due to the strong drafts. This would rotate the stern of the ship. It was always thought how dangerous it was to use hydrogen and helium which were extremely flammable. These are some of the hurdles the builder does face in trying to make Empire State bigger.

The Empire State Building had to deal with dangerous conditions every day such as winds @ CAPS1, heavy lifting, high heights.

After reading The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles that the Empire State Building builders face in attempting to allow airships to dock there are obvious. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most airships used hydrogen, which is very flammable. The risk of fire is particularly low because it is a very populated area. In addition, "The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself" (¶ @ NUM1). With the building so high, "the winds were constantly moving due to strong drafts" (¶ @ NUM1). The conclusion was made that airships land in airstrips because they can be ballasted at the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building face too many obstacles to allow airships to dock there.

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered some problems while trying to allow airships to dock there. The @ CAPS1 issue was a security issue. Most airships @ CAPS2 use highly flammable gases such as hydrogen. It could be a detrimental problem if the airship caught fire above the New York public. Another problem was to work with nature. There were strong air currents moving constantly at the top of the building, rotating the stern of the ships around the mooring mast. Airships couldn't just be weighed down at the rear, as that would pose a safety hazard. The last problem the builders encountered was the law. At the time, there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over cities. Tying a ship to the Empire State Building would be considered illegal.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had planned for this to be the tallest building in existence, but they were thwarted by the engineer of the Chrysler Building. They put a new roof on the building, making it forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men, Al Smith decided to add his own crown to the building. He built a mooring on the 102nd floor that would allow airship travel. Once it was in place, it had to be made compatible with airships. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the building's frame. There was also a need to find safe ways to moor the airships. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch. The balloons were also fueled by flammable gases, a safety hazard in a large city. Additionally, weights could not be hung over city streets in order to get off the ship. These problems caused the airship's popularity to drop dramatically, so the mooring was never used to its full potential.

In the passage, The Mooring Mast by @ ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there are outlined. These obstacles were security, nature and the law, security was an obstacle because the passengers of airships would be endangered. This is evident in the line "... airships outside @ LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." Airships could have exploded, as many have done in the past. Nature was an obstacle as airships could have difficulty hanging onto the mast if the weather was not desirable. This is argued in the quote, "... the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts." The wind could cause airships to move uncontrollably, which would not be very safe for anyone. There was a law against airships in urban areas which was a hindrance. This law is explained in the quote, "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even to approach the area." This law made the mooring mast unnecessary, as it could not be used legally. The obstacles highlighted in the passage Le Mât d'Amarrage of @ ORGANIZATION2, allowed the architects to avoid wasting funds on something that would not be profitable.

In the process of building the Empire State Building, there were many obstacles for the builders. Al Smith, who was the one who designed the building, wanted to make the building taller. He did this by attempting to allow airships to dock on a mooring mast at the top of the building, reaching 1,250 feet high. There were obstacles in the way of achieving this goal. Safety was the main reason it was never used as a docking station. Hydrogen was used in airships, which were highly flammable. An accident had already occurred in connection with an airship, named Hindenburg, in New Jersey. As popular as New York City was, they couldn't risk putting noxious and dangerous gases into a densely populated area. Another problem that occurred to prevent this building from being used as a mooring mast was the strong wind currents that were constantly moving. The airship hung high above the pedestrians who swiveled in the wind, which made it very dangerous and even impractical. A final reason the Empire State Building wouldn't be able to have a mooring mast that airships could land in was that there was a law that said airships were not allowed too low at the top. above urban areas. These were some of the obstacles encountered by the builders of @ ORGANIZATION1.

In this excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems while trying to build a dock for airships. The first problem they faced was how could they put so much pressure on the building structure, as mentioned in paragraph @ NUM1. Another issue the workers faced was the safety of the townspeople below. What if the airship caught fire like the Hindenburg and all pedestrians below would be in danger. In addition, the building around it would also be harmful. As indicated in paragraph @ NUM2, the dock has never really been used. I think they just wanted a reason to make the building taller than the Chrysler Building.

Everyone would love to jump in an airship and move from place to place. However, builders faced many challenges in attempting to do so. One of those challenges included the amount of stress the airship's single cable tie would add to the building. In addition, wind pressure is a dangerous factor that must be taken into consideration, as the airship is so heavy that it could easily fly off and hit someone. The building would also have to be reinforced to accommodate the airship which would cost more than sixty thousand dollars. One of the most important reasons against allowing the airship to dock there is that it could easily catch fire. . " (para @ NUM1) Overall, due to the dangerous factors associated with mooring the dririgible there, these will always outweigh the benefits, and maybe one day the technology can create a safe way to do it.

Based on the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted. One of the hurdles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the airship could not dock with the Empire State Building because the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. . Another obstacle that manufacturers faced was that there was a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make airships illegal if they attempted to approach the area.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles and attempted to allow the airships to dock. The first problem was overall security. Airships built outside the United States required the use of hydrogen. Hydrogen is an extremely flammable gas which presents a great danger. An example of this was when the Hindenburg was destroyed on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. It eventually turned out that if an airship were destroyed over a densely populated area, it could potentially injure many more people. A second hurdle that builders had to face was nature itself. At this altitude, there were strong air currents causing constant wind changes. It was also a danger for the landing of airships. Even if an airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern would continue to sway. It would be more difficult to tie up passengers and allow inspections. In addition, airships would generally be weighted with weights. However, because it was so high, it was neither practical nor safe. The last hurdle these builders had to face was the laws. A specific law did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas. It was also illegal for the airship to dock or even approach the building. Overall, these obstacles negated the potential of the mooring mast.                

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to allow airships to dock there. The first problem, presented in paragraph nine, was that they had not originally designed the building to contain a thousand foot airship with a single cord. "A thousand foot airship moored at the top of the building ... Would add stress to the structure of the building." @ CAPS1 had to reinforce the building to manage this new stress. The second problem, introduced in paragraph thirteen, was that airships consist of a dangerous element, "Hydrogen is very flammable." The builders of the Empire State Building did not want to try their luck on such a populated area. In paragraph fourteen, the reader learns that the wind speed at the top of the building far exceeded the wind speed in other places where airships could be moored. This was a problem because when they normally tied the aft end of the airship with rope and pipe, they could no longer do so due to the location they wanted to tie it down. The builders of the Empire State Building attempted to tackle architectural flaws, airship safety flaws, and nature's flaws allowing airships to dock there, which ultimately did not work.    

<START>

 

Al Smith had incredible vision with his plans for the Empire State Building. However, his enthusiasm for airships to be allowed to dock at the top of the building made him blind to the obvious obstacles in the way. Airships themselves were not safe modes of transportation. Hydrogen is highly flammable and would not be safe near large crowds, such as in an urban area like New York City. From a practical point of view, the mooring mast would not work either, due to the high altitude. The height of the building would have high winds @ CAPS1 it would be difficult for airships to land for passengers to disembark. The last major problem was that there was a law stating that airships should not fly too low over urban areas. Irvan Clavan summed it up by saying: “The still unresolved problems of mooring the airships on a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone the final installation of the landing gear to a later date. However, technology quickly made airships obsolete.          

<START>

 

The main issue with airships landing from the Empire State Building was safety. For some reason, airships were huge; "Some were up to a thousand feet long, the same length as four city blocks in New York City." The Empire State Building is @ NUM1 ft tall. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." If an airship were to land on a windy day, it could potentially crash into other buildings, cutting through the airship's materials. Also on the mooring to the mooring mast, " weighing down aft with lead weights ... " the idea was dangerous. To hold the airship to the building, there would be lead weights, " hanging high above pedestrians in the street, was neither practical nor safe ". Because of all of these issues, the airship would never be safe to land on the mooring mast were the issues the builders faced.            

<START>

 

There were many reasons why the mooring mast could not be used. The first reason is the wind speed. Indeed "in 1930, the airship @ ORGANIZATION1, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to moor because of the strong winds". @ CAPS1 the airships couldn't even get close enough to moor. Another reason was security. In 1937, the German airship Hindenburg sank due to a fire. This situation could have been much worse if the airship fell on densely populated areas, in which thousands of people could die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, it would be illegal for an airship to come close enough to dock.        

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles throughout the construction process. First, many airships were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium, and "hydrogen is highly flammable." @ CAPS1 in the wake of the German Hindenburg rule, the owners of the Empire State Building "realize how much worse the accident could have been", and this led to the decision not to use the mast as a mooring area. Additionally, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast on top of the building, due to the weight of the mooring airships, the architects had to invest "more @ MONEY1" to modify the structure of the building. and allow it to support the weight of a suspended airship @ CAPS2, due to high winds the mooring airships failed to land properly and were "constantly moving". Lead weights could not be used due to the dangers and inconveniences the idea might define on @ LOCATION1 below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast was not easily achievable. Al Smith himself says that the engineers "are trying to find a practical and workable arrangement. As a result, Empire State builders encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow airships to dock on the building.      

<START>

 

The ability to dock airships atop the Empire State Building, while initially lucrative, presented major hurdles. The problems encountered during the development of the mooring mast would be the cost, the flammability of the airships and the weather conditions over NUM1 feet in the air. The structural and cost issues facing Al Smith were that " the stress of airship load and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below ." In order to overcome this obstacle, " the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be altered and ... over sixty thousand dollars of alterations would have to be made ." This is problematic as Al Smith now has to spend more time and money than originally planned. Additionally, another problem is that "most airships from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." This is a huge obstacle because a fire or explosion "over a densely populated area like downtown New York" would be catastrophic and could put thousands of people at risk. Finally, the weather at the top of the Empire State Building is not conducive to mooring airships: “ The winds at the top of the building were constantly turning ... the stern of the ship swiveled around the mooring mast. » This is dangerous for the building structure, surrounding buildings and people nearby. Due to these issues, Al Smith and engineers were unable to complete the mooring mast.

In "The Mooring Mast" by @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles while trying to allow airships to dock there. These obstacles took care of safety, nature itself and the law. The first obstacle was that of security. "Most airships outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." The owners of the Empire State Building realized that if an airship were destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident. Additionally, this accident would be devastating as it would occur in the densely populated area of downtown New York City. In addition, "the winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to strong drafts." These would rotate the stern of the ship around the mooring mast. Airships moored in open fields use weights to be ballasted. Still, these cannot be used atop the Empire State Building, as they would be suspended from walking pedestrians, which is dangerous. Finally, a major obstacle encountered in the attempt to allow airships to dock on the building was the "existing law prohibiting airships from flying too low over urban areas". @ CAPS1, this would make it illegal for a vessel to attach itself to the building or even approach the area. All in all, the obstacles encountered in trying to get airships to dock on the Empire State Building led to this idea disappearing altogether.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of different things when trying to build a dock for airships. Builders had to make sure it was safe to walk on the platform to descend airships. In addition, the wharf had to be high so that the owner could always maintain the highest building record in the world. But with a little hat added, that wasn't going to do much, so building a dock was a better idea.   

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire stat building encountered both man-made and nature issues while trying to get airships to dock there. One of the main problems was the solidity of the buildings. The steel of the building was not very strong to "transmit the pressure of the load of the airship to the foundation of the building". Additionally, "the winds at the top of the building were still moving and full of strong drafts," which would push the Zeppelin into the edges of the building. Airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal even for a ship to tie up to the building. Price was also a factor, along with the cost of the buildings, an additional $ 60,000 of modifications had to be made to the structure of the buildings just to make the building strong and capable of accommodating an airship. Despite all these problems, builders were not surprised to find that mooring airships to the mooring mast was not possible.

According to the excerpt, the morning mast that the obstacle builders @ CAPS1 encountered attempting to clear airships to @ CAPS2 on the state building of Empile. Building a building @ NUM1 feet tall was difficult, adding a mast would be even more difficult. Allowing an airship on land and on the Empire State building would be dangerous. The German airship the @ CAPS3 was destroyed causing damage @ CAPS4. "The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been if it had taken place over a densely populated area like downtown." Therefore, the mast was put in place but was never used as an airship @ CAPS2.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The task of building something on top of the Empire State Building that would allow airships to dock there was a daring and dangerous job. Manufacturers faced many obstacles. One obstacle was the winds. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." This would make the construction very difficult because everything would fly away. Another obstacle was that " the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation ". This means that the builders first had to make the building sturdy enough to contain the mooring place before they could start constructing the mooring place. These two obstacles that the builders faced made the construction of the mooring site much more difficult. It took a lot longer because the building frame had to be reinforced first. In addition, they had to watch the wind so as not to injure themselves.            

<START>

 

The obsticals that the @ CAPS1 had with mooring the airships were that even though they would be tied up in the bow. The rear end would still swivel in the wind. They couldn't blame little expectations because if they ever fell they would @ CAPS2 podestriens. And there was a law before ships could dock on the building or even approach rural areas. These are some of the problems that workers have faced.    

<START>

 

The technology has not been caught up with airships. they couldn't dock because neither the building nor the airship had the proper equipment and that was one of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced. For @ CAPS1: when they have to deliver the newspaper.  

<START>

 

One of the obstacles to the attempt to allow airships to dock with the Empire State Building was to reinforce the building's framing. "The stress of the airship load and the wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below (paragraph @ NUM1)." If the building weren't reinforced, all this stress and force would cause the building to collapse. Another obstacle to the perfect mooring of airships was the modification of its safety. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @ NUM2)." If an airship were to be destroyed by fire in downtown New York, I guarantee you a very serious dangerous accident. Downtown New York is densely populated, a destroyed airship in downtown New York puts airship passengers and downtown pedestrians at risk. Besides the two obstacles explained above, nature is another obstacle to the Empire State Building. Strong winds can affect the building or even the airship. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong air currents (paragraph @ NUM3)." Strong winds could force the stern of the airship to pivot around the mooring mast. A ship pivoting above pedestrians is far from safe. The law requires that airships cannot fly too low over urban areas. Flying too low over urban areas, once again, puts pedestrians and passengers in danger. The airship could be blown away and blow on a sharp arrow at other buildings in the area. These are the obstacles encountered in successfully docking an airship.

The mooring mast architects were blind to the amount of trouble that could have arisen. The balloons aren't very strong, and if they didn't already know it, it's windy on top of the Empire State Building. The wind could drive the humpback chariot right into its bristling fate. They had no real way of containing the cart, as usually lead blocks held it in place. Of 102 stories in the air, this was not the safest plan. Additionally, most non @ CAPS1 airships used hydrogen instead of helium. In a crowded New York City, a fireball like this would be devastating because hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders really should have planned this better.

The builders of the Empire State Building (@ ORGANIZATION2) faced many obstacles while constructing the mooring mast for the airships at the dock. High winds, flammability of foreign ships, and airspace laws hampered production of the airship. Very high in New York, the winds are dangerous. If an airship attempted to dock with it, the back would be whipped and could end up injuring someone. Being that high is dangerous. Many foreign airships were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable as evidenced by the Hindenburg. When this happened, the owners of @ ORGANIZATION2 thought it was too risky to fly these items over highly populated areas. law every time they did. It was not a risk the owner wanted to take. The idea of the mooring mast was a very little known idea. The builders forgot that the wind, the flammability of ships and airspace laws would eventually stop the mast's success. Now the @ ORGANIZATION2 just has an unnecessary long post above it.

Weight was an obstacle they faced. “A thousand foot airship moored at the end of the building, held together by a single tether cable, would add stress to the building structure. The stress of the airship load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted up to the building. to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet lower. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be altered and reinforced to accommodate this new situation.

Some airships were highly flammable "Most airships from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable." They thought it was too dangerous because it was located in a densely populated area. Air pressure was another obstacle he faced. " Fear that the winds would throw the airship at the sharp arrows of another building in the area, piercing the hull of the airship ...

According to the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to allow the dredgers to dock there. "Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." This was the number one fight, a 1000ft wagon would add too much stress to the frame. "The stress of tank loading and wind pressure should be transmitted to the foundation of the building." This was another obstacle the builder had to overcome given that the foundation was eleven hundred feet lower. The Empire State Building then had to be reinforced and modified in order to build a more solid base for docking an airship to the Empire State Building. These are some of the many obstacles encountered by the builder when designing the mast.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast", there were obstacles that the builders faced. Some of the obstacles encountered were related to the strength of the frame. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast to top off the flat roof of the building, as that would put too much strain on the frame. Thus, more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications had been made to the framework of the buildings. Anothe obsticae, the mooring mast was never intended to fulfill its function.

The architects who built the Empire State Building had a big problem trying to get the mooring mast all the way up.

" Although the architects were faced with many problems, it was most important. This ment that they would have to change the structure of the buildings in order to make it work.

In the clip "The Mooring Mast" from @ ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock on its mast. The wind turned out to be a very big problem for airships. Not only did they sway dangerously when attached to the mast, but on the rare occasion that an airship approached the Empire State Building, they couldn't maneuver close enough because of the wind. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts." Another thing that prevented the Empire State Building's dock from being used was the danger it posed to the buildings and people below. The gas, hydrogen, that airships used to float is highly flammable. "When the German airship was destroyed by fire, ... the owners ... realized how much worse the accident would have been ... over a densely populated area." The third and final hurdle they faced was the law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. "This law would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel." With all of this potential danger and despondency, it's no wonder the Empire State Building was never used to dock airships.

The obstacles that the Empire State Building builders faced in attempting to allow airships to dock were a thousand-foot airship moored to the top of the building. Because it was held by a single cable tie which would add stress to the building frame. Another obstacle was that the load of this airship and the pressure of the wind had to be transmitted to the foundation of the building, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Even so, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and reinforced to adapt to this new situation. All in all, it cost over sixty thousand dollars to modify.

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in creating docking stations for airships. One of the main things was that there was a law in place that prohibited the use of low-flying planes in urban areas, like New York City. Another reason is that he just wasn't sure to moor those huge airships that high. Near @ NUM1 a hundred feet high the winds would have been very strong, and with the airship's tail not attached, it was very likely that it could roll over and get tangled with the mast. Also, it was not safe as many foreign airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and if a similar accident to the Hindenburg with fire had occurred in an urban place like New York, it could have been very tragic. Finally, to build the masts, the builders had to reinforce the frame of the building so that it could withstand the stress that such a station would put on the structure.

In the attempt to allow airships to dock atop the Empire State Building, builders faced several different obstacles. One of the hurdles the builders faced was how they were going to modify the building to be able to support a "thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether cable," as that would add too much stress to the framework of buildings. Another obstacle with the modifications to the framing of buildings was money. The construction of this new structure would cost "more than sixty thousand dollars of modifications". One of the biggest hurdles, however, was security. Although most airships in the United States use helium, countries outside the United States primarily use hydrogen. Hydrogen, being highly flammable, was absolutely out of the question to be in a city as heavily and densely populated as New York. Other safety risks included winds that were "constantly shifted due to strong air currents" because the rear of the airship could not be weighed down and also "an existing law against airships flying too low over air. urban areas "which would make their attempts not only dangerous, but illegal. Ultimately, the mooring mast was never completed.

According to the excerpt "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered some obstacles. One of those hurdles was ensuring that airships and other means of air transport did not interfere with the building. Another hurdle that builders had to face was making sure the mooring areas were safe. Because if an airship approaches an urban city like @ CAPS1.Y and all that flammable fuel is leaking out. It would be a great disaster. These are the obstacles that manufacturers have faced.

In The "Mooring Mast" by @ ORGANIZATION1 many issues with the Empire State Building mast are explained. One of the many problems was that the large, out of adjustment object attached to the mast of the building was adding stress to the building, which could cause it to collapse. But this problem was solved by strengthening the foundation of the building. A second issue with docking an airship to the Empire State Building was the highly flammable gases the airship used to become lighter than air. If the airship caught fire, its metal frame could fall to the ground, endangering the citizens below. The last danger would be that while the airship was docked, strong air currents from the building could cause the tail of the airship to spin on the mast. One way to solve this problem would be to place lead weights on the back of the vessel. But if any of those weights fell from the airship, it could potentially harm pedestrians below. Due to these problems, the mast could never be used.

When designing the airship dock atop the Empire State Building, there were @ CAPS1 hurdles that @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 faced. One problem was that they couldn't @ CAPS4 drop the mooring mast over the empire state building because it was too @ CAPS5 for the building frane. So because of this problem, @ CAPS2 and @ CAPS3 had to find a way to modify the framing of the building so that the building could withstand the added stress of the mooring mast. Another problem they faced was that it was @ CAPS4 too dangerous. I was deemed unsafe because most of the airships were filled with hydrogen which was extremely flammable and they couldn't @ CAPS8 if @ CAPS9 got to the Hindenburg 102 stories above the city streets which were crowded with world. So those were @ CAPS4 a few items that @ CAPS2 encountered while building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building     

<START>

 

The @ CAPS1 says the biggest obstacle would be nature itself. The wind would blow the airships on the sharp arrows of other buildings. 

<START>

 

Builders faced many problems that should have been anticipated. Perhaps the main reason was that the @ CAPS1 airships used hydrogen instead of helium as the gas of choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, it would have been fatal in New York if it had exploded. Time has also created great risk. If there was an airship at the dock, the strong air currents would move constantly. The use of lead weights would endanger pedestrians. This idea was neither sure nor practical. One of the most obvious risks was probably the law. There was a law that said airships could fly low over urban areas. For these reasons, he made the Empire State Building a dangerous landing zone.         

<START>

 

After completing the @ ORGANIZATION1, the architects want to start mooring the airships right away. However, due to three potential issues that the architect had never realized before, they were never able to dock any airships. One of the problems was that the @ CAPS1 airships used hydrogen instead of helium. This was a problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable, after the Hindenburg @ CAPS2 in @ ORGANIZATION2, the architects feared a similar catastrophe would occur in @ CAPS3, but many more would die. Another problem was the high winds. Because there was so much wind at the top of the building, it was almost impossible to keep the airships steady. Also, the airship would have rotated when attached to the building because there was nothing holding the front and back. the third problem was that there was a law prohibiting airships flying at the height needed to moor at the Empire State Building. This is why no airship has ever successfully docked on the Empire State Building.        

<START>

 

There were many obstacles that the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there. First of all, as stated in paragraph @ NUM1, "A 1000ft tank moored to the top of the building ... would add stress to the frame of the building." This shows an obstacle because to enable this it would take more than @ MONEY1 of funds. The funds led to the reinforcement and modification of the steel frame. We must therefore redo the fundamental building blocks of the operation. Second, the biggest concern was security. This is handy as most tanks are very flammable. They are made of helium, which is an extremely flammable gas. Also, if the forklift were to climb to the top of the Empire State Building, the back of it would swing endlessly. There might be a chance for this to come apart and crash into a densely populated area. These are some of the reasons behind the obstacles in trying to allow drigibles to tie up to the top of the Empire State Building.          

<START>

 

During the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles while attempting to allow airships to dock with it. In paragraph @ NUM1, we learn that "[this law] would make it illegal for a vessel to tie up to the vessel or even to approach the area." Another obstacle that the Empire State Building construction team faced while constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Due to the strong wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew was constantly changing, making it very difficult for any airship to properly connect to the mast. In paragraph @ NUM2, we are told how if it was possible to connect the mast to an airship whose rear would tilt. "Airships moored in open airstrips could be ballasted at the back with lead weights, but using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be suspended above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. " Because there were too many obstacles with not enough safe options, the mooring mast project was stopped ; proving that during its construction its builders were faced with too many obstacles.        

<START>

 

Designing a mast for airships to land was not easy, architects couldn't just place a mooring mast on the flat roof of @ ORGANIZATION1. To be able to create this mast, the Empire State Building had to be modified and reinforced. First, the architects "designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from within, with a recessed design that mimicked the general shape of the building itself." This rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its aluminum corners and would rise up to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. For the winches and the airship mooring control machinery, they would be placed at the rear of the machinery. Finally, when all this was completed, the existing plans for the building had to be put in place.     

<START>

 

There were many obstacles that the mooring mast builders had to face. They thought it would be an easy task to accomplish, as seen in paragraph eight where Al Smith was asked about the mooring mast and he replied, "[It's] level, okay. No kidding. We are. let's work on it now. " It shows how confident Smith really was about the simplicity of the lens. Although determination was an important factor in the construction of this world famous monument, problems continued to hamper success. For example, in paragraph @ NUM1, the author describes how the Empire State Building would not be able to fulfill its purpose, even though the workers should have known better. She states: “When the German airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse this accident could have been had it been. place above a densely populated area. like downtown New York. " @ CAPS1 continued to impoverish, one of them being the nature. Finally, the workers abandoned after the postponement of the project mainly for reasons of security. At the end from the 1930s the idea for the mooring mast was almost gone, all that really matters is that they tried it, and all it took was just a dream.

In the excerpt "The Mooring Mast", by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered some problems while trying to allow airships to dock there. one of the first issues they encountered was security. "Most airships outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable" (Lüsted, @ NUM1). Builders should keep this in mind. The next obstacle they faced was nature and its winds. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents", (@ NUM2). Winds would be a major problem that builders would have to deal with because it is so unpredictable. Finally, builders had to worry about the law relating to airships flying too low over urban areas "This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even to approach the area" (@ NUM3 ). The builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges of security, nature, and the law in attempting to allow airships to dock at the Empire State Building.        

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles such as safety, nature, and the law in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. The safety issue became evident as most airships made outside of @ LOCATION1 were made with highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. To risk the destruction of one on top of such a bustling city would be devastating. Nature has also become a problem in the futile attempt of the builders. With such "strong drafts" (¶ @ NUM1), the airship would pivot even if it was moored to the mooring mast. Finally, the law was an obstacle for the builders. Existing legislation prohibited airships from "flying too low over urban areas" (¶ @ NUM2), which meant that airships would have no way of landing on top of the urban building. obstacles such as security, nature, and the law hampered the attempt to allow airships to land on the Empire State Building.       

<START>

 

In the @ CAPS1, mooring airships posed many problems. Firstly, boarding passengers would be very difficult as the airship will be @ CAPS2 from a gust of wind. Second, the gases used to float are highly flammable and explode quite easily.  

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles in docking airships. First of all, it was a huge security issue; "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen ... hydrogen is highly flammable" (paragraph @ NUM1) if an accident were to occur (say the magnitude of the Hindenburg) over New York, thousands of people could die from this highly flammable substance. Second, a very big problem was to successfully use the mooring mast. "The winds at the top of the construction works are constantly moving due to the drafts" (paragraph @ NUM2). If the wind was out of control and the airship was not properly strapped in, the high winds could swing dangerously over the people of New York. Among many other reasons and the use of common sense, it is clear that the construction of this mooring mast should never have been considered a reality.      

<START>

 

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's Mooring Mast, you learn about the plans for the Empire State Building, but you also learn why the Mooring Mast cannot be used for its original purpose. The mooring mast was to be used as a docking station for airships or airships. One of the reasons the mooring mast couldn't tie them down was that places outside of the United States were using hydrogen instead of helium. The excerpt states that "most airships outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable." (¶ @ NUM1) @ CAPS1 they didn't make a huge fire in a densely populated area. Another reason it didn't work was the strong drafts. The excerpt states that “ the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to strong drafts. Even if the airship were attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would be wrapped around the mooring mast. " (¶ NUM2 @) @ CAPS1 with this problem, they should worry about the removal of the mast. The last reason is because of a law. The excerpt reads "an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas" (¶ @ NUM3) The mast of the building was too close to humans to allow them to dock there. @ CAPS1 while the mast was a brilliant idea, it couldn't be done now, it's just a dream.

The builders and architects of the Empire State Building encountered many problems while trying to dock the airships at the top. The first problem was that there were very strong winds near the top of the building, which made it extremely difficult for a captain to control his ship. When anchored to the mast with a single tether, the airship was twisted around the boom by the winds, making it nearly impossible to transfer passengers. Another big problem that the builders couldn't overcome was the fact that the streets under the Empire State Building were densely populated. This meant that a disaster similar to the Hindenburg tragedy in New Jersey could claim many more lives in New York. Finally, one of the most obvious hurdles that builders couldn't overcome was the existing law banning airships flying over urban areas. This law prohibited flying an airship at a height that would be necessary to moor on the mast of the Empire State Building. With these obstacles in their way, the builders of the Empire State Building probably never could achieve their dream of mooring airships to the mast.       

<START>

 

One obstacle to the builders of the Empire State Building @ CAPS1 was weight. If the story says, "A thousand foot airship moored to the top of the building, held together by a single tether, would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of airship load and wind pressure should be forwarded to all up to the foundation of the building, which was nearly @ NUM1 feet below. " Another obstacle was nature. The story says, “The biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong drafts. Even though the airship was attached to the building. mooring mast, the stern of the vessel would pivot around and around the mooring mast. "   

<START>

 

The architects had to overcome many obstacles such as the reconstruction of the entire structure of the Empire State Building. In paragraph nine, it says "Architects could not just lay a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building." @ CAPS1 they had to modify and strengthen everything to adapt to the new situation. Another obstacle they faced was that the hydrogen was highly flammable. When a German airship was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that such an accident could be worse on the crowded streets of New York. Another obstacle was nature itself. In paragraph @ NUM1 it is written "The winds at the top of the building were constantly moving due to strong drafts." The stern of the ship would pivot, but could be held with lead weights, but as the @ NUM1 paragraph says "using them at the Empire State Building, where they would be hung, is neither practical nor safe". / Time

The @ CAPS1 of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles in an attempt to allow the airships to be docked there. for example, it would have been almost impossible to moor with the strong winds blowing at this height. "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to the strong air currents. Even if the airship was attached to the mooring mast, the stern of the ship would pivot around the mooring mast." It would not have been @ CAPS2 to land an airship there as the text says the winds at that height were not stable and the ship would sway and spin in the air. Another obstacle the @ CAPS1 encountered was the law of airships flying too low to the ground. “The other practical reason why airships couldn't dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to dock. to the building or even approach the area. ” This means that while an airship could dock at the Empire State Building, it is illegal because all airships must fly a certain height above the area. urban. The workers who were building the Empire State Building had to face many obstacles to allow the airships to dock there. The obstacles were too great to overcome. Thus, no airship has successfully docked there, and none ever will.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. Allowing airships to moor on the mast would be too complex, which the builders did not realize at the start. The more complex obstacle was how the builders were going to tie the airship securely without it not only turning, but tearing the building off its foundations. Builders also had to consider whether it was safe or not and whether it was allowed. Another major hurdle was that not only were the airships too low to the ground to dock, but they were mostly made of hydrogen instead of helium, which was highly flammable. After all the hard work to be successful. Al Smith and his peers had to look out for the best interests of New Yorkers.

Airships are large, steel-framed balloons surrounded by cotton wool and filled with hydrogen and helium. In the early 1930s, the new idea came up that airships would moor atop the Empire State Building in New York City. After reading The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, we learned about the obstacles that builders faced. The author notes that "the biggest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wings at the top of the building were constantly moving due to the strong drafts." Airships would be constantly moving and moving. The author also states that "the other practical reason why airships could not dock with the Empire State Building was an existing law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban areas." This law was put in place for security reasons. Due to the two main obstacles ; nature and the law, the builders, could not allow the airships to dock at the Empire State Building.         

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles if they planned to allow airships there. The first and most serious problem was the safety of the passengers as well as the pedestrians in the street below. Airships are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. In 1937, in New Jersey, the airship Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. This disaster would have been worse if it had taken place over the heads of the people of New York City. Nature also posed a huge threat to the completion of the mooring mast. Due to the drafts at the top of the building, the airship (airship) would be moving constantly. The only way to control the sway of the airship would be to use weights to hold the airship down, which would again endanger the public. In addition to natural hazards, it would have been illegal for airships to dock with the Empire State Building because of an existing law. The idea of allowing airships to tie up to a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building is totally unworkable.       

<START>

 

There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow airships to dock there such as nature, the law, and the sharp arrow. Nature was probably the biggest problem because you can't control the wind. The wind at the top of the Empire State Building was so strong because "... the stern of the ship would pivot constantly ..." It would make it difficult for the airships to land and land. The law was also a problem. There was a law that prevented "... airships from flying too low over urban areas." The spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to shatter any airships flying over it. If an airship were to hit it, it would blow up the airship and kill many people below.      

<START>

 

The only obstacle that the builders encountered when trying to build this building was not that landing the dirigibels was convenient for everyone. The dirigibels have a very fast speed of eight miles an hour, and they were as big as four blocks in New York City, paragraph @ NUM1. This was a problem for the builders because the dirigibels were very big, and so was the building itself. Size was an issue as the huge dirigibels were not going to land in the correct space. Lack of time was always a problem as the building would not be finished on time. Builders have always had to hold back because "engineers have consulted experts ... architects have met presidents" paragraph @ NUM2. Holding back the construction of the building to meet the people of the house took time. When there is something very high and wide in the path, there will be a problem.       

<START>

 

Some of the problems with building mooring airships were that, natural causes like the high winds described in paragraph 6. Airships were highly flammable due to the use of hydrogen gas that made airships fly. Another important factor was also that this project was taking place in a densely populated area, which meant that damage could be done to civilians if something went wrong. 

<START>

 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in their attempt to allow airships to dock there. One problem they had was the strong winds blowing the airship at high altitudes, with people on board, "The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing." Another setback was that it was illegal to fly such a low plane, it was "illegal for a ship to tie up to a building". It was also dangerous for airships running on hydrogen to dock because hydrogen is highly flammable. The Empire State Building's mooring mask has become nothing more than an attraction for tourists.

The obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were that they could not over the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to dock with the building or even approach the area, although two airships attempted to reach the building before the idea was scrapped.

Do you want me to tell you what they had to endure to allow the airships to land there ?! Well to tell you the truth they had to go through a lot of things like "one obstacle lack of a suitable landing zone" also another "obstacle I must say is nature"! let me tell you why I chose these obstacles. Keep reading! They want to tie up the airships to the Empire State Building. I say wanting because the plan didn't work because a lot of things were wrong. like the fact that they said "one of the obstacles was the lack of a proper landing", they couldn't find a good landing zone for airships without something bad happening. another "obstacle they had was nature" I say nature because if the wind was blowing it could take some people away. So these are my main obstacles that they had to cross @ CAPS1 to allow airships to dock there.

We stood there and continued to be patient. It didn't bother us . since we were raised to be patient and wait our turn. I think being patient is very important, because if you stand in line you might make people think they are holding you back, but it's the line that goes slowly.

There was a time when I found out I was going to @ LOCATION1 now that's the good part but when I ask "how are we going to get there?" we had to fly and at that point I knew I was going to have to be very patient and thought I didn't have enough patients to fly @ LOCATION1. Although I went through it. Now the worst part is when I got to @ LOCATION1 it was very hot. We had to stay outside to wait for the bus. It was so hot I lost all of my patients and got so mad at everyone I thought I was going to explode! Only because I didn't want to wait for the ride anymore. Haha I came to my senses and started, that was why it was easier to wait and the bus finally arrived and I was already feeling so much better.

On a beautiful sunny day, I was trapped in a doctor's office without air conditioning. this doctor's office had @ NUM1 chairs in the dirty waiting room. I was already crammed into the room with about @ NUM2 people for @ NUM3 minutes. I tried to be patient but the patience wore off. Sweat was streaming down my face onto my black shirt @ PERSON1 shorts- @ CAPS1. I was starting to get hot and angry, but I kept my patience. I know if I was going to get even more angry it wouldn't help or speed up the time. Then all of a sudden, "creeeeeck", the door opened. A tall white woman with green shrubs said, "@ CAPS2".

Once I was patient it was @ DATE1, when I was in line to pilot the dragster at point @ CAPS1. I had a super hot day, I was at point @ CAPS1 with my best friend and we were getting ready to get on the dragster. The line is about an hour long and the sun is beating down on you, so for me it was forever. Just as we were about to make the ride, they stepped in because the ride was not working properly. So we had to wait another @ NUM1 minutes. Fortunately my best friend and I have had good patients unlike other people who barged in within the first five minutes. We waited and got on the ride and it was one of the funniest experiences of my life. “I'm so glad we waited,” my best friend @ PERSON1 said. Some people have patients like @ PERSON1 and me, and others don't like the people who have run there. I'm glad we waited or it wouldn't have happened. In this case, the patient was a good thing for @ PERSON1 and me.

One day, my football team was in the championship game against the lions. At the start of the match, I was on the bench, I was the worst on my team. After @ DATE1 we were up @ NUM1 but my trainer put me on the bench anyway and I sat there and clapped for myself. The next quarters went by and it was a draw @ NUM2. Halfway through @ DATE2 the star player got injured so the coach put me on. I didn't know what to do, I was just chasing the ball. With a minute to go, I was standing next to their goalie and one of my teammates shot the ball in the air and hit me on the foot. The ball was redirected to the goal, my team started to cheer us on, we were up @ NUM3. When the @ DATE2 minute was over the horns went off and everyone again clapped and lifted me up. This is how patience helped me.

This is a story that I was patient on, I was on a @ LOCATION1 "@ LOCATION1, so this is what is happening on @ LOCATION1. I was standing in line to order sausage, eggs , pancakes with atia syrup, chestnuts and orange juice and I had my cool derille sat a man with a steak for his head and ordered something and sat down, and I get kinda mad on I I am still patient, okay, but i'm really mad because the steak chef is his before mine and got in here first. So i calm down because a cute cute girl is walking in order and come and sit where I was sitting, then an old woman thinks there is goding and hip, they and they order to sit. Finally the girl and I finally have a meal and show the people hipsters that we challenged them to enter a surf contest, but the main thing is to sit and wait and be patient even through @ NUM1 in @ TIME1.

Tick, tock, tock, tock. Being patient is difficult for some people, but easy for others. I am not a very patient person. I will tell about a time when I was patient. (the only time) Once my mom and sister went to the doctor because my sister had an appointment with the doctor. I asked my mom how long this was going to be and she said "about @ NUM1 min". @ CAPS1 I said ok. @ CAPS1 we got there and she asked me if I wanted to come in and I said no I will wait in the car. @ CAPS1 I was inside the car waiting and I had a boar and I turned on the music and it was ??? about @ NUM2 or @ NUM3 in. About @ NUM4 later I got tired of listening to music. @ CAPS1 I tried to fall asleep. It didn't work @ CAPS1 I went out to stretch because my arms and legs were outstretched. It was @ NUM5 and my mom and sister are coming on foot. It was a time when I was patient.

One day @ CAPS1 went to Pretty Earlie School in @ TIME1. He just went ?? if it was a normal day, and headed for its star class in the @ category of NUM1. He chatted with his all-star friends and the class was over. Then it goes to science @ NUM2 hour and there is a lab with partners. @ CAPS3 him and @ PERSON2 decide to be partners. halfway through the lab, they don't know what to do. @ @ CAPS3 CAPS1 goes to the teacher and interupts her and another student. @ CAPS3 the teacher says to be sick with you in a moment, but he keeps bugging her. @ CAPS3 he got a step. Then later that day he was in @ CAPS2 and working on a worksheet, but the teacher was writing with the principal. @ CAPS3 he decided to wait for her to do @ CAPS3 he didn't get into trouble, but it was much longer than expected @ CAPS3 he noved th problem following his. then the teacher comes back and he got her help. @ CAPS3 in conclusion @ PERSON1 learned two lessons that day. One that you can get in trouble for being impatient and getting a step. Two that if you are pollite and courtaeous in class and be patient you can get the reward of getting a letter citizenship rating. Wich @ PERSON1 did that day.

I remember once that a famous madican named @ PERSON1 preferred a stunt that required a lot of patience and courage, his name was "@ CAPS1 In Time". The madichian must have been in a block of ice for @ NUM1 days or @ NUM2 hours ! The tall Madichian only had one sweater. He opened the consilated mirror to the public as the magnificent Madichian said "I could hardly hear anything". He waited for hours and seemed to fall on an abyss or a bottomless pit. Until the end of the last few seconds. The Madichian finally free. And alive

One day a few years ago I woke up and my mom said we were going to my grandmother's house. So started to prepare. After I finished dressing, I watched. My dresser and I grabbed my @ MONEY2 @ MONEY3 which I was saving to buy something in case we went to the store. When we got there I saw my cousin's dad @ CAPS1 walking a puppy. I walked up to him and asked him about the dog, he said it was his brother's dog and he was selling it. My mom told me I could have a dog, so I asked her how much it cost. @ CAPS1 said @ MONEY1. I was really excited because I had @ MONEY2 and was able to get @ MONEY3 through my granding. So I called my mom but she was busy elsewhere but she told me she wanted to see the dog before I bought it. So @ CAPS1 waited for hours but my mom took forever. Then finally I got impatient and bought it. But my wow wasn't crazy cause she ended up loving him

The time I was patient was not that long ago. It was a day of boredom and waiting. I went to a candy store to buy candy, wanted a pop truck. The man told me to hang on while he took my candy. It was @ NUM1 minutes until he brought me my candy. I was patient enough to wait for my candy. There was another day like this. It was at the cernique, I was at the end of the line while waiting to take a walk. There was a man arguing with the life guard instructor for not letting him go upstairs. He chatted for half an hour. S was patient while he waited for him to stop. I didn't complain or discuss the man who wasted our time.

One day I was patient when I tried volleyball. I had to be patient because the two coaches had to choose who was going to be part of a team and if so which team. My friends and I waited patiently in the gum while the coaches privately told the kids in the hallway. They had to do this in private as there are two teams, Team 'A' and Team '@ CAPS1'. Finally, there were about @ NUM1 other girls still waiting. I chose to go last because I thought I could meet the challenge of patience but I was wrong. The pleasure of finding out was @ CAPS2 ! Finally, it was my turn to step out into the lobby and find out that I was on the '@ CAPS1' team. Even though it wasn't the 'A' team, I was still glad I didn't come out. It was a day when I had to be very patient.

Once I was patient it was last year in a cheering contest. At the start of the day, I was patient to stand in line to get ready to play. Once we were ready we would wait to go play. Afterwards, we played, we went to see the rest of the teams. The other teams were really good. Then the team went to lunch while some of the teams were still playing. We had to wait until all the teams finished. Once the teams were done they called all the teams to the mat, it was rewards time. All the teams sat down on the mat. My team members waited patiently to see if we went into cheering or dancing. We waited… and waited… and waited until he finally called his name. The college junior cheerleader ! We took the first in dance and the fourth in cheering. That day was a good day for me and I was very patient and being patient may or may not be as you want it to be. You never do now until this happens. It was a time when I was patient in cheering contests.

I'm writing about my time being patient on a game @ ORGANIZATION1. It was my birthday and my dad took me to see the @ LOCATION1 vs. @ LOCATION2 at @ LOCATION1 huggets. We were in a huge traffic jam. The jam was caused by a wreck a few miles away and everyone was trying to get to the game before it started. I was patient with the whole trip as the trip was about @ NUM1 ½ hours. My dad, uncle, aunt and I were all a little frustrated that it was taking so long, but I kept my cool and was able to cross the @ NUM1 ½ hour drive. When we got into the arena, @ LOCATION1 and @ CAPS1 were warming up and the game was about to begin. At the end of the day, the @ LOCATION1 won. It was the best birthday I have ever had. Now I don't think I could ever keep my cool like this because I have a very short fuse now in order. I will never forget this anniversary again.

Be patient? Being patient is very difficult for me because I am bipolar and I have anger issues. My experience with patience is when I lived with my host family !!! They had grandchildren who really pissed me off !!! My host family had a different religion from mine I am an atheist. They are @ CAPS1 and they would constantly tell me that I am wrong !!! It pissed me off a lot but I didn't say anything because I was patient. And I hate it. With my anger issues, I am very surprised that I didn't attack them? But yes, patience takes a lot of practice, a lot of practice. Because not everyone in this world is patient !!! Tolerance on children… I don't like children too much, but where I got married to live there were tons of grandchildren who were the grandchildren of my foster family and I continued that these kids were boring but I had to put up with them. Children are very hard to tolerate just like "parent guardians" they are the worst, they tell you what to do and they are not even your parents, but I tolerated it.

The one where I was patient was when we were going north. We had to pack our bags but I was already done because I had done the job before my family was still packing and I went to sit in the car because I was already ready I had nothing 'other to do when I got inside the house they were almost done packing so I went to the bathroom when I got out they were done packing. When we left I had to wait over @ NUM1 hours to get to where we were going but when we got there we had fun. The reason I used this example as an example is that it took a lot of patience to get to Mackinoc City from nbly. That day I learned a lot about the importance of being patient.    

<START>

 

Patients are very important. But I'm not very good with my patients. And when I am and I wait my turn I end up forgetting what I'm going to say. I guess I am not very patient because my family is not very patient. My family is not very patient because we just want to say what we are going to say before we forget it. Is the family is also very forgetful. This is probably another reason why we are not patient. Patients are important because it helps you calm down and helps you take your turn. That's all I know about patients.        

<START>

 

Patience is when you can take your time for something. When you are able to wait, in no rush to push, to rush as if something bad is happening. Being patient also means that you are understanding when it comes to the tolerant and that when you are calm, cool, peaceful and in love !!!

When I was patient. It was when I was going down the river with my dad and two sisters (@ CAPS1 @ MONEY1). The only way I can be patient is when my dad says we're going north to @ LOCATION1. So I didn't choose to be patient because it's a two hour trip. But there is a railroad bridge my dad uses the least @ CAPS2 on and brakes and has lunch and the bridge is about an hour down the river if you really do all the way but when just me and my dad go we just slit our way out of the hole.

Patience? I'm not the patient type. I am @ PERSON1 @ CAPS1. He played in a @ CAPS11 called @ CAPS2 that I really wanted @ CAPS10. Who came out @ DATE1. That I haven't even seen yet until one day I was sitting on my porch where I asked my mom to @ CAPS19 to @ CAPS9 and @ CAPS10 @ CAPS2 that @ DATE2 when she said "wlc" I was really upset because I wanted @ CAPS10 it's really, really bad. I was very patient at the time. I had called my @ CAPS4, @ CAPS5, my sisters and my brothers to give me the preference. @ CAPS14 they said they were busy so I fell asleep crying. The next @ NUM1 days my mom and dad were talking about going to the movies and having dinner. I walked in shouting and shouting "@ CAPS6 ARE @ CAPS7 @ CAPS8 @ CAPS9 AND @ CAPS10 A @ CAPS11 AND @ CAPS12 @ CAPS13 @ CAPS14 @ CAPS7 @ CAPS16 '@ CAPS17 @ CAPS9 @ CAPS19 @ CAPS7 OWN @ CAPS21" @ CAPS22 I left the room. The next day my brother and his girlfriend went to @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 knowing I wanted @ CAPS9. They came home to reassure me that @ CAPS6 was indeed @ CAPS11. So that night I went down the stairs to ask @ CAPS9 @ CAPS10 "@ CAPS2" saying "I am very patient with you to take me to @ CAPS10 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS14 you all push my buttons so j 'demands from @ CAPS9 tomarrow "@ CAPS22 I waited @ NUM2 seconds @ CAPS22 she said I could @ CAPS9 this @ DATE2. This was the very @ NUM3 time that I was patient, and I'm proud of myself, I'm waiting @ CAPS16 '@ CAPS17 @ CAPS10 my @ CAPS25 @ PERSON1 @ CAPS26 "

I am not at all a patient person. But sometimes I have to be like my birthday for example, I would love for my birthday to come at least every month. But of course I only have @ NUM1 birthday per year so I have to wait. I would like to be a patient person. It's just not in the cards for me. My father, on the other hand, is more patient than anyone. I know he will tell me to clean the car @ DATE1 I told him I haven't done it yet so he says he will give me more time. I couldn't be so patient with my children. I would tell them to clean it up now or they would be grounded. I wouldn't make them do anything, but I'm not going to wait a whole month to have my car cleaned! I guess I could try to be so patient with my dad, but it would be really difficult. Although if I am "patient" I am sure I will be able to do it!

Patience is when you wait for something to happen and struggle but don't complain. My friend @ PERSON2 is a patient person. She and her brother are both very patient. Their father spent most of their life fighting for our country. This is the story of the time when @ PERSON2 and his brother @ PERSON1 were patient. When @ PERSON1 was born, his father was @ NUM1 years old. @ PERSON1 dad had already applied for the army. His father has been most of his life. Two years later @ CAPS1 sister my best friend was born. Their dad was with them until @ CAPS2 exie was around @ NUM2 I think, but he left that year. @ PERSON1 again why her dad was gone, but @ PERSON2 is about a year late because she has very bad ADHD, so not sure why she hasn't seen or talked to her dad for about three years. When she was about six she knew her dad was gone and that was the time @ PERSON1 joined the military and that was also the time their dad was in the leg by a machete. When they came back for about a year, they spent a lot of time with him, and @ PERSON2 is very fragile and he was trying to play with her and tickle her and it hurt @ PERSON2 and she was screaming "@ CAPS3!" @ CAPS3 ! " But it didn't work, he just kept acting like he didn't hear her. @ PERSON1 is not fragile at all, he loves her dad and her too but she doesn't don't like as a person. She loves my dad more than hers because she sees him more and thinks he's nicer. In conclusion, I think @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 are very patient because they don't know if they'll ever see him again someday after he gets on that plane, and i asked their mom and she says they never complain about missing their dad.

Patience is an important thing. Patience is when you are understanding and tolerant. I have been patient several times. For example, when my mom uses the phone late until she gets up to talk to her. Before events like plays or movies, you need to be patient until the movie starts playing. I am very patient during the tests. Like this one, average patience is very important. If you don't have patience with certain people, it's anxious. If I didn't have patience, I would be a completely person ??? people would take care of me a lot and each of them @ CAPS1 would get along with me so inside bothering someone @ CAPS2-stop being patient.

Long ago in the land of @ LOCATION1, there was a young boy named @ CAPS1. @ CAPS1 wanted to be a ninja like the rest of the older boys but he was too young, he was only six years old. , @ CAPS1 came running home, he wasn't just running he was spinning, twirling @ CAPS1 acting like fireworks, @ CAPS1 came bursting threw the door, and said "mama mama im @ CAPS2 old enough to be a ninga "said @ CAPS1, and kins mom said" well, sorry you can't ninja training is only six years away, "kins mum said," why now when i have @ CAPS2 my twelfth birthday. ” @ CAPS1 replied“ Well the sensai is still in training so you have to be patient ”so @ CAPS1 waited six long years and @ CAPS2 became a ninja

One in a country called @ CAPS1 bokane there was a youngster named @ PERSON2. In the country of @ CAPS2, everyone lived off the land. They believed that everything has a spirit, and when you die the spirit of judgment decides what you will be in the next life. For the folks at @ CAPS2, honor was everything, and no one liked @ CAPS6 more than the hunter @ PERSON2. One day @ PERSON2 and his friend @ PERSON1 went to the sacred forest to hunt the Danes, an animal resembling a deer. As they approached the hunting grounds, the two men notched their bows and pulled up the trunk of an old oak tree. @ PERSON2 and @ PERSON1 waited several hours before seeing a dane, and when they did, @ PERSON1 had no arrows ready, @ CAPS4 from this @ PERSON2 killed @ CAPS6. The Danish looked @ PERSON2. @ CAPS6 looked at it . The pupils no longer blink. Sniffing the blue haze from his nose. Still, @ PERSON2 didn't take the hit. Instead, the Dane fled into the tree line. “@ CAPS5 didn't you take the picture ?” @ PERSON1 whispered. “@ CAPS6 was too far my friend. I wasn't sure an arrow would kill @ CAPS6 painlessly.” @ PERSON2 simply replied. The next day the pain returned to the woods and again a dane appeared . This time, however, @ PERSON1 had an arrow ready, but @ PERSON2 had rites for this Danish because @ CAPS6 was the same as the day before. The back of the Danish was towards pair, and again @ CAPS6 was in ringing at @ PERSON2. @ PERSON2 just stepped back. Soon @ PERSON1 took the picture because @ PERSON2 wouldn't. The arrow flew high and impaled the obsidian tip into an ash tree. "@ CAPS5 n 'didn't you take the picture ? "@ PERSON1 whispered. " @ CAPS6 is not honorable to take the life of a beast with @ CAPS6's back turned. "@ PERSON2 whispered. On the third day , the same Danish crossed the hunting grove of @ PERSON2 and @ LOCATION 1. The Danish crossed the grove from the left this time giving @ PERSON2 a clear shot on his right flank This shot @ PERSON2 takes. The arrow flies through the tree and pierces the lungs and heart of the animal. “@ CAPS9, the spiritual judge @ CAPS10 will be thrilled.” @ PERSON2 as he brings his murder back from the woods. In the end, patience rewards better than impatience. No matter what.

One time I was patient was when my family and I went fishing at @ LOCATION1, @ CAPS1. Once we got on the boat it took us @ NUM1 minutes to cross the river. Then at @ NUM2, we just waited, hanging out in the water. Rock from side to side like a baby in its cradle. Installation of all poles and tures. Then towards @ NUM3, we got our first shot. My dad rushed over to retrieve the pole and started reaching out as fast as he could. Finally, he put it in it, it was @ ORGANIZATION1 at @ MONEY1. Then towards @ NUM4 another post got hit, I rushed over to grab the post and started to realize it. With a little help my fish turned out to be a king @ ORGANIZATION1 that happened to @ NUM5. and @ NUM6 inches tall. This is why it always helps to be patient. You never know what that 's going to happen if you are patient.

A long time ago my family and I used to go to a cabin that we owned. It was about a four hour drive. This is the most fun place to go. I was so happy that I couldn't wait until we got there. I knew I had to be patient. But I wanted so badly to get there. But if I complained a lot, I knew I would be in trouble. I know this because I had to learn the way. About a few weeks before we were due to visit my grandmother, she lived about two hours away. I kept complaining that it was taking too long. Then when we got home later at that height, my phone was taken away for a week, so after that I knew never to complain again about something that was taking too long. So on my way to my grandmother's cottage, I didn't complain. Not complaining is smart to do. If you are not patient, do not go on long trips. It's good to be patient since I was patient all the way to my grandmother, my mom was happy with me. If you are patient, people will know that you are a very tolerant person.

I once went to @ CAPS1 and had to sit in the parlor / area for about @ NUM1 min- @ NUM2 min. I really didn't care, because I had to go to school after I finished, you could tell everything about me was not very happy because you only had to wait @ NUM3 minutes. I finally got in and went to sit on the chair and they took off my rubber bands and I had to sit there and wait about @ NUM4 minutes. I was still patient, because I didn't want to go to school. I don't like coming in the middle of the class, because everyone is looking at you. The doctor finally came to see me, then I put on rubber bands of different colors. The doctor is also came to see me and see if my corset was fine. I finally got out of the office @ CAPS1 and it was around @ NUM5 so I went home and was happy.

It was a time when I was patient when I went to the hairdresser and my family and I went on a trip and had to have my hair cut the day before we left. I went to the barber shop was packed so the guy who cut my hair told me I was next in the chair. So more and more people started to come in and he let these people jump in front of me so I set there and waited. After these people were done, he never called me, so he picked up his phone and walked out. Then he told me to wait for him to come out of the bathroom, then five other people walked in, that's when my mom called my phone and asked if I was done because I had gone from @ NUM1 to @ NUM2 and she said go see someone else's chair because he was about to go somewhere. I still needed to pick up my things and will be leaving at @ NUM3 am the next morning.

One week @ DATE1 a few years ago my grandparents were dead. We went to my @ ORGANIZATION1's sisters and my @ ORGANIZATION1 and my aunt (my @ ORGANIZATION1's sister) were going to teach me how to tie my shoes because I was going to kindergarten and the teacher wouldn't do it for you . They said if I learned how to tie my shoes I would pick something at the dollar store which got me excited! When we had theirs after lunch, they started teaching me. The tirck they taught me went like this : after taking the first cross step you do the bop (tree) and you put the other string around (the rabbit who loves around the tree. @ CAPS1 you pass him (the darling rabbit in his hole.) @ CAPS1 you are bound. After many tries I was starting to understand. Later we returned home and my @ ORGANIZATION1 continued to help me. Finally one afternoon I got it, my @ ORGANIZATION1 was happy and she kept telling me good job. Later we went to the store and chose something! My @ ORGANIZATION1 must have be patient with me. She didn't get mad when I kept messing it up, she just continued to be encouraging and patient. My @ ORGANIZATION1 was patient and it helped me learn faster.

Patience. Being patient means that you have to constantly do and do something to get it across. It is patience. My mother is patient. When I understand a problem, she explains @ CAPS1 to me, never in a hurry. She doesn't yell at me when I don't understand, unlike my father who is very impatient. He was screaming and maybe insulting me in chinease. It happens almost every time I don't understand something. But my mom will keep explaining to me until I understand what @ CAPS1 means. Some people @ MONTH1 are impatient because of triats or because they have high blood pressure. Patience is something my people have, but @ CAPS1 seems like even moving people lack @ CAPS1.

Swimming is great fun. I like to smell the cool water all around me. Patience is an important part of swimming, you need to be patient while waiting to start practice, stretching, waiting for instructions when learning a new swim, learning a new way to turn the wall, etc. . On the first day of the swim team this year, the coaches looked at the safety rules, the regulations and what we were going to do this year. For all the people who already knew this stuff, like me, it was not very easy to be patient. But I personally think the whole team did a good job of listening. Patience is important.

Patience, what is it really? Do any of us have it? I think if we think about it, we could all be patient. Once when I was at @ LOCATION1 we went to @ ORGANIZATION1 and didn't wait for the rides. Next time we went we had to be patient as the lines were really long. I could wait, but it seemed like a lot of small children were having a hard time staying still. Another example of patents is that when the miners were registered in the mine at @ LOCATION2 for @ NUM1 days, they had to be patient and wait for someone to rescue them. They also had to be patient when they got up from the mine in that magical little elevator thing. A final example of patience is that when you walk in a group with other people, you have to be patient and listen to their ideas and let them do some of the work. I think these are just a few examples of why you need to be patient or when you need to be patient.

The time I was patient was when we first went to work at the disco and I was very excited! We only had a week to wait to go.

I will write about patience in my own way, even if you are adults. Once they were a little warm and silky, they were preparing to turn into a month of butter fly. But this silky worm had a problem, it was still too thin to change, it must be beautiful and as big as a big stick of pratle cut in half. He liked to go from bush to bush, eating all the green leaves he could find. But here's where an inferior issue tripped to please. It was becoming the winter cut side, so every leaf he found was brown and nasty. In the grass was changing. But he wanted to change into moath so badly that he chose to eat the leaves and the grass. In he was very patient about it. But then he practiced eating leaves and grass, so he became more and more impatient because he wanted to change so much that he explained…. But he woke up to see that it was in a white silk wrapper, so he got out of it. He was actually a butterfly after all, but he remembered he ate good green leaves together. In wrapped her ??? until you want to sleep. And that's how he had this strange dream.

I have lived in a lot of different. Places throughout my life. These are @ ORGANIZATION1, @ PERSON1, @ CAPS1, @ LOCATION2, @ LOCATION1 and @ CAPS2. It's @ CAPS3 different place. @ CAPS6 was and still is land at about @ CAPS6 @ CAPS4 somewhere along that long road at @ LOCATION2, my parents were devastated. My dad moved to @ CAPS5 and eventually @ PERSON2. We moved to @ LOCATION1 with my mom (my sister and me). @ CAPS6 was fun there because @ CAPS6 hadn't seen my cousin, aunt, uncle, and grandma in about six years. @ CAPS4 I haven't seen my dad for almost @ NUM1 month. My grandmother says not to move and see him soon. Soon @ CAPS6 didn't think like @ NUM2 months meant. During these @ NUM2 months we wanted a neat house with a patch of work and fresh water @ DATE1. My mom even had a boyfriend who she broke up with later. Then later she started and still dates the guy we rent an awesome house to. When my dad called and said he was coming, @ CAPS6 got me. So happy. @ CAPS6 @ CAPS7 didn't know @ CAPS6 could do @ CAPS6 @ NUM4 months without seeing my dad. @ CAPS4 @ CAPS6 did @ CAPS6. Now that he's settled in, see him once per game over a weekend. With better than @ NUM4 months or not at all.

I was patient on the trip to @ LOCATION1 it took two days to get there. I was hungry and had to go to the bathroom every time I was hungry. had to be patient without complaining. So I had to be patient until the gas tank was empty that's when we got gas and I could eat something or I had to be patient until there is a @ CAPS1 on the right hand or a test area as there is a vending machine there and bathrooms there too. On the right because you can go down and then take the motorway again. It was then that I had to be patient.

When I was patient. I have been patient once or twice. I once had to use the phone but my mom was on it. So I waited an hour and a half to use the phone. Another time was when I wanted to go to @ ORGANIZATION1 to have some pop. So I waited while my mom got everyone ready to go to @ ORGANIZATION1.

It was my first camping trip! Well we went camping when I was a year old but I don't remember much. I was super excited! So I'm sorry if I couldn't help but wonder @ CAPS1 on? are we going! My patience was not very good. While I was waiting for my dad to hook the motorhome to his truck, I sat there very bored. I kept saying when are you gonna be done? Or, when are we leaving? Whenever I have it, just be patient honey. So, I tried that it didn't really work. We finally left, it was an hour's drive and when you're seven it's a very long time. I had nothing to do, I was bored to the point of losing my mind! So I said "daddy when are we going to be there?" I arrived later, just be patient. So I followed the requests and followed his idea. When I got there the first thing I wanted to do was swim. While my mother was putting on his shirt of bath . I was so impatient that I felt like I had ants in my pots. I was going to go knock on the bathroom door but, I didn't take what I had learned earlier and I did. I sat down and waited patiently for my mother. So, throughout this, I learned a great lesson about patience. If you are patient, things will go much faster. I still use this lesson today. But every now and then everyone is a little impatient.

Once I was patient was when my brothers and I were waiting to see if they were going to allow us to have our first puppy. We waited and waited for about an hour while my parents discussed whether or not we should. When they finally called us downstairs. At first they said no and we were devastated. My mom really wanted the puppy but it was my dad's decision. My sister then made a face that my father couldn't resist. So he said yes. So I had to be patient. We had to leave town in two days, so we couldn't have it the next day. The next day came and my dad was at work. So my mom decided to surprise my dad by bringing the puppy home today (@ CAPS1). We picked him up at the store (shaggy @ CAPS2) because my aunt who lived in another state allowed us to bring @ CAPS1 with us to her home. He was surprised and delighted to see us playing with @ CAPS1 away from home. we all fell in love with @ CAPS1 and he's our new cuddly pal !

You have to be careful when baking cookies. Baking cookies takes a long time. You have to be patient when you are waiting to play a game. And you have to stay calm in the waiting room until they call your name. You have to be pacive when you go out in a game, you have to be pacive to get @ CAPS1. When you get a home run you have to be peaceful when trying to get the ball. For example sorry game you have to be patient to get @ NUM1 card, @ NUM2 if you get one you can go out of the house. if you get a to you go out and get another turn.

My sister is very patient unlike my brothers and me. Well my brother and I had progress reports coming up and I was so excited to see what I had, and my brothers were anxious and we are still both working a mom saying when they come you have them . But my sister was always calm and patient. Then the day they arrived we got nervous except @ PERSON1. The reason she is patient is that she tries to distract herself by sleeping or reading. But back to the school reports, we opened them up and everyone was happy even @ CAPS1 because we got good grades. Then my brothers and I learned from my sister and now we all have patience.

I know I can I said to myself as I was about to backtrack for the first time on my own. I leaned back, tried to tip over and feel! Uh ! I got up and asked @ PERSON1 my trainer : "@ CAPS1 my shoulders, right ?" @ CAPS2 @ CAPS1 your shoulder the kick. "@ CAPS3 got it" I say. As I leaned back again, I slowly lifted my left leg up to kick, then pushed my shoulders forward and did it ! I finally did it myself! Later that night, I showed my mom that I could do it. So I did exactly the same as I did in training. I did it again! But this time at home. The look on my mom's face could never be replaced @ CAPS4 was so proud of me. Then I @ CAPS4 ran and gave me a high five, then a big bear hug ! So I said "thank you for being so patient." @ CAPS4 said "@ CAPS5 for you baby."

I was patient when my mother gave birth to my little brother. We had to sit in the waiting room. My sister and I for @ NUM1 hours, I slept @ NUM2 times and a lot because my dad was hungry so he also got @ CAPS1 food. The first hour I was excited and couldn't wait. The second hour I colored with the crayons and paper the nurse brought to @ CAPS1. The third hour, I watched television. The fourth hour, I slept until about @ TIME1, that's what my sister said. My dad walked out in a plastic robe with the shower head / shower cover and matching slippers, and he said "next time he goes out my sister and I will be a little boy's sister." @ CAPS1 and her sister were so happy. So an hour later my dad came out and said "Do you want to see @ PERSON1", @ CAPS1 and my sister screamed "yes" When we saw him we were so happy to think he was all up to us.

If you could ask one thing, would you ask for patients or motivation ? In this situation, I would ask for patients. I remember when I was about four or five years old. My two sisters and I got bored @ CAPS1 in Florida. It looked like we were sitting on the @ CAPS1 for hours before it took off. After about ten minutes, I asked if we would be there soon. My sister said no and we were only in the air for about ten minutes. I looked at all the people sitting there some were on laptops listening to @ CAPS2 players. I looked up at my sister and wondered how she could be so patient. After I asked if we were almost there for the second time, my sister did not answer me. I just sat there doing nothing. I had nothing for fun. I didn't say a word for two hours and then finally fell asleep. If you could ask one thing, would you ask for patients or motivation ? I'm still not very patient, but I'm more patient than I was back then.

"@ CAPS1 ! Search!" @ CAPS2 shouted. The sound of the metal cracking was deafening. There was no way out. My eyes seemed sealed, but they were as wide as possible. The grim silence frightened me. I felt arms grab me, pulling me towards @ CAPS9, they felt they were safe. In no case should this be taken as a security, as it was the start of a living nightmare. The living nightmare of my life. Here is a photo of @ CAPS9 that I saw: @ CAPS3 cars, twisted, tangled and crushed so close together that they appeared to be just one object. Next to me was a little boy. This boy was my brother, @ ORGANIZATION1. His chest expands slowly, but in doing so excruciating sounds emanate from him. Blood is coming out of his many cuts. It is unbearable to watch. Ambulance sirens howl as they approach. My father, I haven't seen it yet. And it's @ CAPS9 that scares me the most. I still have nightmares from that night. At night, everything changed. Not only had I lost my dad and my brother, but somehow I lost my mom as @ CAPS6. @ CAPS5 would never understand the pain of watching your little brother die, all because of something you wanted. If I hadn't turned my father around to retrieve my forgotten notebook, I would still have a @ CAPS1 and a small @ ORGANIZATION1. Since the funeral, I could feel my mother and I separating. Nothing with us has been the same since. We fight constantly, never listening to @ CAPS9 the other has to say. Maybe it's just the life of a typical teenage girl and her @ CAPS8. I wouldn't know because we are by no means typical. When we're not fighting for who knows- @ CAPS9, we just keep our distance. Sometimes, however, the silence is more frightening, more thrilling, than the screaming. The silence is so scary! My mother begins to attempt the impossible. @ CAPS5 is starting to try to figure out my weird ways. “@ CAPS4”, @ CAPS5 begins, “I know I haven't been patient with you lately, and I'm sorry. I'll try to be, from now on. I won't ask you just one thing. I ask her a question, a look, so @ CAPS5 continues : “I would like you to tell me why you are making yourself feel guilty ?” @ CAPS5 didn't have to explain any further. ”@ CAPS6, I Turned @ CAPS1 around, "my voice got stuck in my throat," just to get my stupid notebook. " A single tear crept down my face. " @ CAPS7, honey ! " my mom cried as @ CAPS6. " It's not your fault ! You had no idea it would end that way! I knew my patience had been running out for a long time, but I refused to take it on to my mom now. @ CAPS5 was only trying to help. I fought my annoyed tone, struggling to get out. But I had to win this fight. "@ CAPS8," I said, regaining my composure, "it's how i feel at pro posed a problem. I wish I could take your word for it, and maybe I will with the overtime, but right now I just need my @ CAPS8. @ CAPS9 shocked me the most, it was the smile that formed on my mother's lips. "I'll wait then." And then @ CAPS5 gave me a hug. @ CAPS5 hugged me like @ CAPS5 when I was four and broke my leg. Tight and without hesitation. I could feel the start of a new relationship with my mother. Maybe not as strong as he had been, but definitely there. With patience and time, it turned into a healthy relationship, one in which we can both appreciate and respect.

There was a time when I was patient when my little brothers' play station didn't work, so it took a while to get used to it. It was a @ TIME1 and my little brother had just finished eating and he wanted to play his @ CAPS1 but he was having trouble turning it on but the problem was some of his games were scratched. But the next day we bought a lot of other games from him that were brand new. As he tried out the games, he still couldn't do it. While he asked if I could help him so I helped him but it still didn't work until I cleaned up the playstation which we had to patiently wait for and that ultimately ??? but my little brother and I say "work, work, work, work" until this continues. So today we still say that for @ CAPS1 it can work.

Patience. I was patient when I had to sit for the baby. I rock him and play with him. I fed him and walked him. He fell asleep. My mom still hasn't come home from work. I'm gonna be late to the movies with my cuzins. I'm playing the game for @ CAPS1. I look out the window and sit down on the steps. mom is still not here. My cuzins were outside. Ask that to stay a little on gen. Now hear mom. I can go now.

I have often been patient, but here are a few. It was a late afternoon, my family and I were supposed to be going to a big reception that day. As always I didn't know what to wear, about an hour later I found out what to wear. I walked down the stairs until soon no one was ready and we only had @ NUM1 1 / @ NUM1 an hour left. I was frustrated that I told everyone to go get ready, but no one listened to me. But I didn't care so I went to have a shower just as I was out my mom came over and said I had to wait ??? She took a shower. Then one by one everyone took a shower except me. I was losing my patients. I waited again because I didn't want to trigger a commotion. Finally I went to take a shower. We were all dressed and ready to go. At the last moment when we all got in the car my sister got her bag and jacket so we had to wait for her to have it. We finally got to the party, not on time but at least we made it. In conclusion, a few review pies of me showing patients is when I waited to pick one up or when I waited for my sister to put on a jacket.

The time I was patient was when I was waiting for my mom to get it @ CAPS2. The reason is that she was hurting me. She was mean and everything. So I was like my @ CAPS1 needs to have this @ CAPS2 for this to all be done. This was back when she was only @ NUM1 months old, so I know I had to be so patient with her until the @ NUM2 months were up.

One of the best ways for a person to have patience is to get stalked in a game of paintball. I experienced it once and hope it never happens again. I used to play paintball with a lot of my friends, and if I hadn't been patient I would have ended up being shot in the head with paint. I was in a small forest, breathing hard after a close encounter, and I was behind a really thin tree. I had eliminated everyone except one. I started to breathe harder because he was right next to the tree I was leaning against. I decided that I would be about to sacrifice myself if I stayed there, so I climbed the tree. I was lucky I had a camouflage shirt because if I didn't blend in I would get shot. I was sunk deep into the tree, but it wouldn't have mattered, as I was too heavy for any of the branches. I fell from the tree, but as I fell I shot the enemy in the leg. I had won! This is how patience rewards you.

I was patient a few years ago with my brother @ PERSON1. It was almost his birthday and he was very excited. He was excited because he wanted a flying toy helicopter that he had seen while watching TV, the helicopter was very expensive, and I wasn't sure if he had it for his birthday or not. He wanted me to tell him if this is how he continued to bother me. I wanted to yell at him or hit him, he was so annoying. I didn't, because I knew if I did, I'd be in trouble. So I invented a game with him so that he would forget about the helicopter and stop asking me. It didn't work, because he kept asking me for anything. I invented another game where you have to jump on the trampoline and turn your arms like a helicopter without falling. Eventually he stopped asking me about the helicopter and after we had eaten some cake we had to remind him. When he opened his presents, he got a helicopter. We spent the rest of the day trying to get it to fly.

One evening, when I was happy to come home, I was hungry and dinner was not even toast. We had steak, brown rice and mack and cheese. I used to go upstairs to take a shower, take ten minutes to shower and it still wasn't ready. So I did some homework. I have done math, reading, and studying for an exam. The mack and chees was ready, the steak was almost ready, and the brown rice wasn't even ready to be ready. I was so hungry and tried, but kept my patient. Oh my god the food smelled so good. I wanted to eat right away. I was so hungry that I had to put some chewing gum in my mouth to occupy myself. Two minutes later the steak was ready, the mack and the cheese were ready but we are still waiting for the brown rice. My sister and I set the table and poured our drinks. I still had my patient. Five minutes later the food was ready. The four of us sat down at the table and ate. Oh my God, it was so delicious. I had two tiny pieces of steak, three scoops of rice, love rice, and a tiny bit of mack and chees. The dinner was awesome. After this dinner, I went straight to bed.

I was very patient once. We were on a train going to @ LOCATION1. I didn't have my game or my music player. He suited up live he would never pass, @ CAPS2 I didn't complain. I sat in the seat for what seemed like an eternity. Then when we got off the train I said “@ CAPS1. I'm done.” @ CAPS2 then there was the bus ride to the science museum a story. Not like in you to myself. Once again, stop after stop, we went. Until we finally have theirs. It was amazing, there were tons of cool stuff like amiten doing highs or @ CAPS3. @ CAPS2 so patience is ?? when we went to history. It was the train everywhere. Dad had to see anything and everything ??? Then we had to take the bus back to the train. Then the agin trained. @ CAPS2 this time I had a top that was getting boring so I still didn't complain. @ CAPS2 dad said it must be long and I could bring my OS next time. This is my example of pacification.

He was there for a while and suddenly I had to go to the bathroom. I waited and waited and must have been very bad. I was very polite and patient because I never yelled at him or knocked on the door telling him to hurry, I asked him once if it was okay and I said yes after that I just waited , then he came out and @ CAPS1 a really big real life

Patience, what do you think of when you hear this word? When I was little I always thought that it would just be impossible to have something like this, but after I seriously injured my ankle and being patted in a cast and on crutches for four months , I really understood. My mother always used to say " patience is a virtue ", have you ever wondered what it takes to have patience ? Well, it's really just the ability to control yourself, you have to be able to go through tough situations while controlling yourself, and you have to really control yourself when people are bothering you.

At the doctor's there were a lot of people and we decided to stay and wait. My mom and dad also went with me and my sister to the doctor. Also, my sister and I wanted to go out and play, but my parents said no, so we watch TV, my mom reads a magazine and my dad reads the newspaper. Finally were theirs a bit ??? I left, so after the person went to the doctor, call my name and my sister to have my mom and dad come with us. So my sister is not scared, she just did check-ups after my dad paid and we left the house so we were patient.

Once his years seemed like a layman who was at the front of the lunch queue and he was about to come in but he had to go because he wasn't quite in the queue.

Patience is waiting for something for a long time . If you have patience, it's good for you here is a time when I had patience. Last year at @ DATE1 after school my dad and I went deer hunting at @ CAPS1. He went to see this blind homeguard we found sitting on a chair waiting for a deer to arrive. You have to be patient to go hunting. We didn't see anything but a deer came up and my dad got ready and he said ' cover your ear ' and then he shot but we didn't see any sign of deer blood so he must have run out, then we packed up and went home. It was then that I had the patience to go hunting with my father, but we received nothing.

One time I was patient was when I broke my foot. It was a @ DATE1 when I was at the park. I climbed a pole to ring the bell when I slipped. My little brother ran over to them and I told him to go get help. He didn't know where to go so I lay on the floor with a broken foot for more than @ NUM1. when my brother came back he asked "where am I going?" And I told him to go to the gas station across the street and ask to use the phone. I was trying to be patient when he came back, he had my mom. My mom said I was really patient. She picked me up and we went to the emergency room. When we got there it was packed. They let us in as soon as they could, but it seemed like a long time to me. When he called my name, my mom picked me up and she went to the doctor. He asked "what brings you here?" we broke the news to him and he walked into the room. The doctor moved my foot. Ten minutes later, he came back with the x-rays and told us that my foot was broken. He gave me a cast and crushes, and then we left. I said thank you to my brother and gave him a really big hug. The next day everyone at school said I was brave and very patient and I said thank you!

I was patient once when I was at @ LOCATION1 to take a ride called "@ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 parents @ CAPS3". @ CAPS4 was a long queue @ CAPS5 and I usually say "@ CAPS6 enabled!" Or sometimes "@ CAPS7 let's go !" @ CAPS8, I was a patient @ CAPS5 in the queue. I was proud of myself and my mother too. It was the time when I was patient.

Tic times tak tiking I was once patient he was in the doctors office my oppment was two and I had to wait and wait and wait and wait I sat there until he was @ NUM1 and they called me finnly. Once again, I had to wait and wait again. So I was trying so hard to be patient and trust myself, it's not easy for me at least because I can't even sit there for @ NUM2 minutes and stay still, I have to move around so c it was hard to sit still listening to the tik tok sound for a while. And that was back when I was patient, it was hard to believe but I did. The hardest part was when you have one of those tiker clocks here and I've been there for a while now you are absolutely now for some people including me. Sometimes it's hard for you to be patient, sometimes it's okay to be pocient and sometimes it's so hard to be soothed and just sit there and oh absolutely jot down so this is my story about the time i was patient and wasnt inpocit sitting there doing noting not conplaning wating and @ CAPS1 stores.

One time I was patient was when there was a twenty-two hour drive to Florida. It was me, my cousin, my two sisters and my parents. It was very boring. I was seated in the back with my sister and we continued to fight for foot space. About five hours later, I felt cramped. We stopped for dinner, then hit the road again. When it got dark, the road froze and we pulled over and slept in the car. We woke up at sunrise and went to the cracker barrel for breakfast. That was delicious. Then we got back in the car and drove the rest of the way to Florida. The @ MONTH1 was a long ride, but it was worth it.

Some people say that if someone tries to bore you and you are patient, they will stop, but that is not always true. One day my brother was downloading new ringtones which I thought wasn't a big deal until he downloaded the mosquito tone. Mosquito tone is a high-pitched, loud noise that only people under a certain age can hear. It's really funny if you play it but you listen to it. it hurts your ears and gives you a headache. So one day my brother had this idea. one that only a moron could have. he decides he's going to follow me around playing it as loud as possible. It was terrible, it made my blood shiver. After thirty minutes I decided to call myself but it didn't really help. Then I listened to music, so he edited it. Then I had this amazing idea. I stole his battery. The next day, I made a deal with him. If he stopped playing that ringtone, I would give him back his drums. Of course he said yes, so I didn't have to set the tone anymore. So now you know why patience doesn't always work.

I waited the entire @ DATE1. Although it was only because @ CAPS2's mom had promised to buy me a brand new video game system. This new video game system was the Wii. Because @ CAPS5 had just come and interested me the first time I saw @ CAPS5. @ CAPS5 was a doctor in every way and had advanced graphics. I immediately informed @ CAPS2's mother about this system. "@ CAPS1, I will be purchasing @ CAPS5 for you, as your newsletter was outstanding." @ CAPS2's mother guaranteed me. "@ CAPS3! Thanks to your mother," I exclaimed enthusiastically. Now I was starting to hope @ CAPS2 and expected @ CAPS5 within @ CAPS6 weeks. Although I did it only to disappoint myself later. @ CAPS2's mother informed us that I should receive @ CAPS5 between one and several months. "@ CAPS4 @ CAPS5" I shouted. "@ CAPS6 months ?" “@ CAPS3 @ CAPS6 months, I don't have enough time to thank for this stuff, there are more important things to consider,” explained @ CAPS2's mom. So that's what started the longest patient waiting period in @ CAPS2's life. After about a month and a half of waiting, @ CAPS2's mom finally had and, “@ CAPS9 is going to @ CAPS10 today to buy your wii.” “At that exact moment. I almost exploded with happiness.” @ CAPS3 ! "@ CAPS12 I had started doing a dance that nobody understood, not even me. So when @ CAPS9 pulled up to @ CAPS2's favorite video game store, I was so excited I couldn't stay seated. ”@ CAPS13 down ! Damn, @ CAPS5 is just a video game system! "I @ CAPS12 quit immediately." That's what you @ CAPS14. "I mumbled to myself. When @ CAPS9 had come home at home I had continued to play until @ TIME1, which is when I learned @ CAPS5 pays off when your patient.

Patience is hard for me because I hardly have any more patients for anything! So you can imagine how difficult it was for me and anyone who has no patience in queuing at Disneyland. First of all, the drive was horrible and long. We were in the car for what felt like an eternity before we finally got there. I tried my best to be patient and I was. I didn't complain at all. When we got to Disneyland on day one the queues were horrible! Some of the waits lasted up to NUM1 hours ! Well I didn't complain, but it was hard not to! My little brother wanted to do all of those kid's rides where the queues were huge, but I insisted on my patients not to disturb anyone. Since I like everything to be done quickly and not wasting my time waiting, I felt like I was going to explode at dinner. Dinner was a this seafood restaurant which was bad anyway because i hate seafood! While all this waiting was happening, I kept my patience even when it took an hour to get our meals! The worst part was waiting for the Disney buses to return to your hotel. My mom and dad said they were very proud that I looked after my patients while I was waiting. I learned a lot of things there. One Disneyland is not a good place for people like me who are not very patient. The second patient is one of the most difficult things in life, but some of the best things in life require patience. So this is @ NUM2 times when I was supposed to have a lot of patients, but I realized that patients were a good thing to have.

One day I went to a concert at @ ORGANIZATION1 and there was a really long line. While I was in the line there was this girl who didn't have a patient because we had to stand in line for @ NUM1 1 / @ NUM1 hours when that hour passed we all went to get our seats and before I did that it was so long line again but even longer but it was ok because I had patients. With all these patients it reminded me of my mom when she went to the doctor's office for @ NUM3 hours and had to wait in her waiting room. And also I went to my living room with my mom and she just started talking on the phone and she told me to hold on but my sister kept interrupting her and I told her you had to hold on and leave mom finished talking on the phone so she ran up the stairs and said you were stupid so i said i don't care.

I remember when I was patient with my parents. It started when I saw this game that I wanted at the store. I kindly asked my dad to get it, so he said he would get it the following weekend. So I had to be patient and wait for the weekend. I was so excited to have the new game that I often talked about it without remembering my dad telling me not to tell my mom. Well the weekend has finally come and when I asked my dad if he was ready to go he said no. When I asked my dad why he didn't say it was because I hadn't closed my mouth so my mom didn't want me to have it yet. Now I was angry of course because my mom always says and has nothing to say to my dad and me when I have a game. At that point my dad walked into the room and said tomorrow maybe it was @ DATE1 he said. I could borrow money from my grandmother and then get it. This is exactly what I did and I have my game. Later my dad gave him his money back and we were all happy. The point is, it took a lot of patience to get my reward.

Being patient as a child is never really easy. I know being patient is like taking mom's pacifier off a baby, it's not pretty. But once I really had to use my patience. Now it was not at all easy to queue at Isle of Kings @ NUM1 hours just to continue unreadable. socio. We waited about @ NUM2 more minutes, maybe @ NUM3 minutes and yes ! He started to function again. So many people had left us, it was nice because my line shortened some of them, but it was probably going to be a long wait. It was nice when we entered the building as it was nice and air conditioned. We sat around warning and waiting to debate whether or not to wheiner. We wanted to stay or go, we ended up staying and waiting for what felt like an eternity! Until we enter the space snottle. There was another room that we had to walk through to get to the merry-go-round. Finally. The outing was over! Using my patience and waiting in a line forever really paid off in the end. It was a great ride.

@ PERSON1, it's boring ! I want to try my backflip! I cried. @ CAPS1, you are not ready yet, wait. If you wait and practice more it will be easier, ”@ PERSON1 said, as she spotted one of the other gymnasts in their back-hard-spring. We had been working on our back-hard-springs for weeks and I was the best of them in the class. We had to wait another two weeks until we started our back jumps, but I really wanted to try it. I rolled my eyes at @ ORGANIZATION1's response and continued to practice my back-hard-springs. I was doing them down the corner, and in the middle of each one, I was doing a little roll for fun. Someone called @ PERSON1 so she came out of the gym to talk to them. Just because she was my trainer, didn't mean she had to tell me when I should or shouldn't do my back flip. I really wanted to try it, and @ PERSON1 was out of the room, so this was my chance. I took a deep breath and rushed into my backflip. As I hovered in the air, the thought that I had never learned how to land my flip crossed my mind, and I landed on my ankle. "@ CAPS2 !" I screamed. I tried to stand up , but I couldn't ; my ankle hurts so much! @ PERSON1 ran into the gym as I fell, after trying to get up. " Has @ CAPS3 arrived ? " " I tried my back flip. " "I told you not to do it!" If you were patient and waited for me to show you how to do one, this wouldn't have happened! "@ CAPS4…" "I'll go get an ice pack." @ CAPS5 since that day I have problems with my ankle. If I had been patient I wouldn't have been injured, and I would still be in gymnastics, @ CAPS6 so I knew being patient is the right thing to do. "

When I was patient, it was when my mother would take my sisters shopping. My dad was at work and my mom took me shopping with my older sisters it was boring but it was a bit full because some clothes in the store had boys on one side and girls on the side. 'other. One store only had girls ' clothes that I hated. But I didn't say anything after that because I was so patient that I wondered where you want to go? I said better buy I got a game it was college football oq. When you have patients it can pay off in the end and still have patients wherever you go or still have patients.

Patience is important in life. Something when you don't have patience things tend to go wrong and that's not always a good thing, so here are things when you don't have patience. If you don't have patience, you can be in trouble. For example, if you were in a long queue for something and you couldn't speak because if you did speak you would be in trouble. So if you had no patience you would probably say @ CAPS1 my God it takes forever. Then you would be in trouble for speaking. Here is another reason why you should have patience. You should have patience for an example, otherwise you would need patience if you were sick and went to the doctor's office and there was a really long queue you would say to get it and then go home. So if you would go home you would get even sicker and it would get even sicker and it would be serious. Finally, another reason if you haven't had the patience. For example, let's say you wanted to go to the mall and forget about a new pair of shoes. You went to the store and found a pair that you liked and that fits you perfectly. But when you went to check the cash register was not working so they had to call maintenance, to come fix it and they told you it would be an hour. So you sat down and waited twenty minutes but didn't have patience so you said get it and walked away and didn't take the shoes off. These were people who had no patience. But if they did, it wouldn't have happened to them because they would have waited or needed. Having patience is good, but not having it.

I sat there looking away, waiting for something to happen. I casually leaned back in my chair and propped my head up to the ceiling. I did my best to clear my head and be patient. But when I opened them I was sitting on inline bars for celar paint @ ORGANIZATION1. The voices of many people passed through my ears in the form of laughter, happiness and danger. The queue was estimated to be a two hour wait, but my friend @ PERSON1 and I wanted to make the trip. We started on the roller coaster as the sun beat down on us laughing at us. "@ CAPS1 is it taking that long ?!" I said impatiently. "@ CAPS2 next time we should go during the week. Do you want to go?" "@ CAPS3." I fought with myself to be patient for the ride. The line was spinning slowly. Drops of sweat are forming on my forehead. I wanted to be patient, so I pulled out my walkman and thought about my music. I have become more willing to wait. But before I knew it, people were yelling at us to come forward. Embarrassed, I stuck my music player in my pocket. But the line has changed enormously. It had been about an hour and forty minutes when we were at the place to ride. I was proud to be patient. We watched the ride and jumped on it. Patience really pays off. I have learned to be patient with all kinds of things.

I am very patient when I hunt and fish. I always go hunting, find a place, and settle in a tree. I have been waiting for a long time for the deer and the trukey and @ CAPS1.

Once I was patient, I would wait for my fitted, mirror-like league hats to arrive in the mail.

" @ CAPS1. " I said I was really, so screwed up but I thought they were coming tomorrow and ??? the didn't come so I was still patient but I was about to not been for two days, so I just gave up then one day when I got back from my friends' house they were there yes finally all my patients paid and this is the moment I had patients.

As the hours passed, @ ORGANIZATION1, seconds, @ CAPS1, @ ORGANIZATION2, everyone was fidgeting, but I was patient ; I sat down, waited, listened, read, but nothing compared to the scorching final moment when the bell rang and the students clapped. A smile on everyone's faces as they left the door for the last time that year.

One day, Alex was bothered. Ao I decided to be patient. But he kept on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, on, so I decided to tell him to shut up. Again he didn't listen to me so I said to @ PERSON2, alex hasn't stopped yet so I didn't say anything and was going to try to be patient with the @ CAPS1. Talk a lot and @ PERSON1. And finally it worked and Alex finally stopped. So I was happy. But he (Alex) did it again so I told him to stop, I would tell the teacher again.

"@ CAPS1 @ CAPS8 ! Really?" it was a @ DATE1 @ TIME1 at @ LOCATION1 pritz. The forecast was @ CAPS8. @ CAPS8 and @ CAPS1 @ CAPS8. The tigers were playing "@ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 @ CAPS4". @ PERSON1 launched for @ CAPS4 and justin @ CAPS6 for tigers. My father + mother and brother and I were only two rows away from the first row. It was the bottom of the first one and I feel a huge drop of @ CAPS8 touching my head. So I feel different from someone else. "@ CAPS7 upstairs for shelter !" my dad screamed. As soon as we got up in the selter area we finished poor. That's all I have to say. The players went to the dugduts. My mom called my grandfather to see the forecast. "@ CAPS8." @ CAPS9 said. My mom took off her sweatshirt and gave it to me and my brother and said "it's going to be long @ TIME1 so get some rest now" at first I didn't get it. But after she explained it to me, I knew it was going to be long. At the time, I was only @ NUM1 or @ NUM2, so waiting isn't really my thing. An hour later it was still raining. @ NUM3 hours, then, @ NUM4, then finally 41 / @ NUM3 hours passed. It was @ NUM6 at @ TIME1 ! The game still did not start. My mother called my grandfather back. @ CAPS9 said we still have a good hour left of @ CAPS8. We have sat there forever! My family and I were so bored. But my mom said patience will pay off. @ NUM7 ½ hours later. It cleared up. They wiped down the seats for us. We were ready to watch a game at @ NUM8 am ! My dad bought us all ice cream for being so patient. The game ended at @ NUM9 ! we only stayed until @ NUM4.00 because of the commute. In the end, I got to see an awesome baseball game (and get some ice cream.) I learned that patience pays off!

This is when I had to be patient. Hope you enjoyed it. I am not a very patient person. I have very rarely been patient. But, there are times I was. I still remember three years ago when I was in class @ NUM1 my whole day was full of patience. That day I was picked up early. I was picked up early at school because that night I was going to @ ORGANIZATION2 and @ ORGANIZATION1. When I woke up I was so excited! I have been waiting for this day for four months! I was so happy that it was finally the day; when i got to school i had to break the news to everyone. My friend went a few days ago and said it was a good @ ORGANIZATION1. When the end of the day approached, the speaker in my class said "@ CAPS1", then the lady and I had ?????????? For a start ?? mission that I have been waiting for! After being taken care of, we went for my cousins to school too ! Then we went to the house where we got ready and left for a day that we were all waiting for….

The time I was patient was when we went to the mall to get my personalized hat. It was the only time I was patient. I went to the store called lio's. I picked out my hat and everything. So I said I meant he did it all, then I asked how long he said @ NUM1 mineuts. We walked around the mall and returned to the store which took like @ NUM2 to @ NUM3 minuts. So I asked the guy if it was done, he said "not yet" I was watching him make another guy hat. So he stopped the other guys' hats, I didn't want to do a scene and yell at the guy so I wait and wait for him to finally be done with the hat, which took about an hour. So I thanked the guy and left the store with my new hat on and was happy.

This is my path of patience: patience is power without patience where would you be when you wait for your house to be built? Yaid is probably going crazy because you do n't want to live in a trailer, RV, or even a dirty house ! What if you were in a doctor's office for @ NUM1 hours ! Yes you will be agitated! But, see if you have patience, you can expect patience is power!

The patient is very hard when you expect something you want. Very hard when you are in a very loud line or when ordering something on the internet and you only have to wait two or three days. If you are not a patient person who cannot wait for the simplest thing that will only take time, then you are a very impatient person who cannot wait. If you are an impatient person, you are selfish, crazy, and clearly not patient.

When I was at the mall once with @ PERSON1 we still wanted to run away and bought some malching hats and skirts. Then we went to the chineze stand and there was a bag like ???.

Then a for family was looking for a seat and @ CAPS1 we got up and gave them our table. Then we went to the cinema and we stood in line and @ PERSON1 was impatient @ CAPS1 we asked him to reserve our place. Then I took @ PERSON1 across the street and had @ PERSON1 a thick show.

Hunting is one of my favorite hobbies. Hunting takes what you will consider a lot of patience. When you sit in a blind tree you are having @ MONTH1 one of the most boring @ NUM1 minutes of your life, which certainly requires a lot of patience. Once you have settled in and are at peace, the wood comes to life all around you. I have to admit that I don't have a lot of patience, but the hunt takes another patience. Hunting is something many might think of as just sitting around doing nothing. But if you are patient and calm enough, you are rewarded with whatever you hunt. It's something that I think requires a lot of patience, but it's not the kind of patience you would think of, it's entertaining patience. That's why I think everyone should be more patient.

Once upon a time a preteen name lola @ CAPS1 lived in a country called land of hurt and lola was a single queen @ CAPS1 had lots of money and food and @ CAPS1 had a big house but there was one thing missing at lola @ CAPS3 was a preteen prince, there were a lot of boys pouncing on her, but none of the cute and strong preteen boys was right for her. So one day @ CAPS1 wanted to go to the village and see all her people and they were very happy to see her scream her name llola lolal and tell her she was the best queen they ever had. Then after he stopped shouting his name @ CAPS1 saw a cute strong preteen prince and his name was @ PERSON2 and @ CAPS1 fell in love and went over there and said hello and he said @ CAPS4. Then @ CAPS1 said you wanted to come over to my place and have dinner and he said yes. Where do you live and @ CAPS1 said in the big place he said ok at six o'clock. He didn't know @ CAPS1 was a queen so he went to the place and they played carb legs and then after dinner they played video games after they started loving each other. Then a month later, the boyfriend and girlfriend were all fine. @ CAPS1 wanted him to ask her to marry him but @ CAPS1 had to wait patiently and @ CAPS1 did @ CAPS1 waited a year and he still has not asked her to marry him. @ CAPS1 again that if @ CAPS1 asks him @ CAPS3 will not work then @ CAPS1 is waiting and @ CAPS1 is still waiting and he says did not ask him so the next day @ CAPS1 went out with his friends @ PERSON1, @ LOCATION1, feanne and @ CAPS5 and they went to @ CAPS6 and they sat in the mud bath and they were talking about how @ LOCATION2 and @ PERSON2 were doing and @ LOCATION2 said they were fine. @ CAPS3 just won't ask me to marry him, I don't think he wants to ask me, but we live together. The next day @ CAPS1 @ CAPS1 came home and all her friends and family were in her house and in front of everyone he asked her to marry him and @ CAPS1 said yes and everyone was happy for her and he said i was gonna ask you I just wanted @ CAPS3 to be the one you will never forget and @ CAPS1 ask his friends if they knew and they said yes everyone knew we just couldn't not tell you.

Your way on patience. How to be patient, not be rude and just sit there and wait your turn. To me, patience means you stand or sit there quietly and without rude comments. For example, once my friend mom was patient for her because she had to wait for her while my mom traded my brother Helment. When I was in the store, my cousin would have patience to pull out an outfit and I would take a lot of time. When my brother and I were on the shore he would buy a pair of shoes. I was patient. I didn't get angry or make any rude comments. One time my nephew and I were in the store and I was ordering food and he made some rude comments, but he was impatient. Your choice of patience is that you have to be patient and wait your turn to go. The purpose of this writing is for you to be patient in life.

Once when my family went to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1, we had to queue for the only caustic roll I said was. Well, I wasn't as patient as my sister was, but I was pretty patient. After the trip, I forgot how long it took to make the trip. My parents remember they thought we left the park and went somewhere. Well there are many other times that I have been patient like the time my friend took two days to put music on my @ CAPS2. She had just received her @ CAPS2 key and she wanted to put some music on it. So she asked me if I wanted more music on my @ CAPS2 as well. Well, I said yes. Even though I know I can't go a day without using or just looking at my @ CAPS2. But the only thing I could do was be patient. Ok after two days she finally gave it back. I thanked her and asked her what had taken so long. She said the composer took forever and his inferences were there like an eternity.

"@ CAPS1" @ CAPS2 my teacher said "@ CAPS3 we start the meap test!" "uhhh" the @ CAPS2 sighed at the exact same time. After the teacher distributed our brochures, we filled out the information, wrote down our names and started over. While the test dragged on, I finished @ CAPS4 @ CAPS5 ! But there were slow workers who were very slow. I was bored! Nothing to do except sit down. I wanted to complain but I decided not to do it for the sake of my @ CAPS2, finally the @ NUM1 part was over. "It's time for the @ NUM2 @ CAPS2 game !" exclaimed the teacher. “ Oh, you're kidding me,” I said to myself. The @ NUM2 part was short, but it took a child @ NUM4 minutes ! At the end of the day, the teacher was very proud of my patience. Later that year my meap results came in and they were fantastic !

I once was patient going to @ LOCATION1 because the car ride was @ NUM1 hours. I was hungry, bored and really needed to go to the bathroom. I didn't tell anyone because I knew we couldn't stop. I looked out the window but got bored. We were going to @ LOCATION3, I was happy to stop by and eat at @ LOCATION3, I know from @ LOCATION2 to @ LOCATION3 it's not a long way but hey I eat at @ NUM2 and it's like midday. We finally eat as if we had and one hour at @ LOCATION3. I did a really good job being a painter, because when I'm not I'm really in the mood and people don't want to be with me when I'm in the mood.

Personal patience is someone who manages difficulties without complaint. Like when you wait in the doctor's office for an exam. Or in ophthalmologists maybe a dentist. When you are in the doctor's office everything is silent, then a phone rings ! Then the doctor or dentist steps in. We just have to wait and wait.

“Time to get out!” Said the professor, happy that @ CAPS2 is going to have a break soon. All the kids are rushing outside to @ NUM1 come and play with us were playing skipping rope !

"@ CAPS2 said with an annoyed tone!" Good! "Said the little girl as @ CAPS2 crossed the lenses and barked around . One of the lovers came to @ PERSON1 at ! @ PERSON1 wants to play tag, or hide and seek." @ CAPS3, "@ CAPS2 said nicely with his rims tucked in his knees as @ CAPS2 ran away waving his arms. @ PERSON1 laughed at him then thought @ CAPS4 I'm playing with him so my other friend will be crazy. But @ CAPS2 was mean ! The little boy who was especially waiting for @ ORGANIZATION1's decision to be made jumped like a bunny trying to make her laugh again. ”@ PERSON1 !!! Said the little girl jumping up and down, making her small. plastic shoes when they hit the ground. "I don't have to play with @ NUM2 said," but I'm your best friend. work on me! @ PERSON1 said " Alright ! " @ CAPS2 a said again and the lit girl ran off "I can play with you know" @ CAPS2 said "@ CAPS7 lets play tag?" @ CAPS2 said laughing then @ NUM3 said.

The last @ DATE1 I went to @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2. And we drove for hours! Oh my God, her ass short ! We got there and there was no room to pack our bags so we went to the back of the parking lot! but then i was excited we were walking to the park i was the bad twister and surprised my @ CAPS3 asked me to pick the first round i said the bad twister so we walked in and looked at the line for the nasty twister and guess what it took @ NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. I was so patient that day and then we cut the corner and there were like @ NUM2 more people ! So that day I hiked almost every ride in the park and ate @ NUM3 pound whole burger fries and a shake ! So here is my story on my patience!

My mom tells her that she has to wait but she replies, 'I don't want to wait. I sat and looked out the window in silence because that was all I could really do. @ PERSON1 yells "I have to go to the bathroom." "@ PERSON1 I said if you please be patient. " I gave her a candy which only silenced her for a few minutes. @ NUM1 minutes have passed and my sister is sleeping soundly. I asked mum when did she think the traffic was going to go away stop. She told me she had no @ NUM 2 minutes later the traffic starts moving but stops then starts moving again. Finally we got to our exit and my sister goes over to the class dance. She got out of the car and rushed into the studio. It was a moment when I was patient.

About three years ago my family and I spent a weekend at @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 at dusk, @ LOCATION1. It was a perfect weekend apart from driving four hours in the car with older and younger siblings in the car. It was loud, there was crying, there was all this annoying mess, but I was patient. When my family and I arrived at @ ORGANIZATION1 @ ORGANIZATION1 it was crowded ! Like a crowded packet of jam. My mom took her little sister and brother on the kids rides and my dad took my brother and me. My group went on all the great scary rides. I did just about all the scary races that day except the @ CAPS1 @ CAPS2 @ CAPS3 !!! It was the greatest ride ever. I was dying to go. My group stood in line and realized that their line was about half a mile long and the park was going to get dressed soon. Twenty minutes later… I was so patient in that line. We were within a quarter mile of the line. My dad decided it wasn't worth it. So my group met the rest of my family and unfortunately we left @ ORGANIZATION1. It was one of the saddest trips ever . So maybe next time I should be more patient.

Have you ever waited for something or someone without complaining? If so, you are patient. Patience isn't just about waiting a long time, it's about being respectful and not complaining about waiting. To be patient you need to be respectful and calm unless they ask you for something. It takes a lot of work to be patient. If you are in school and need to use the bathroom, wait until the teachers have finished talking to someone, or if they are on powerschool. Do not interrupt teachers during a meeting or when they are talking. People will like you a little more if your patient. So remember, when you are expecting someone or something, remember the word patience.

When I was in third grade, I hoped that a friend of mine had some disabilities, but I had to learn to be patient with him. When it comes to dating someone like him, patience plays a big part in befriending him. Even though he was on his days, I was like “ you have it and have patience ” and to this day he and I are still friends.

I'll tell you about when I was patience. For a long time, I hoped you will read. I was going to @ LOCATION1 to go to Quisney's world. This is forever! It took three days of driving. We play a game like I spy or a game boy. We very rarely take a break to pee or eat. I did not like the trip. But when we finally got there it was worth it. We had fun.          

<START>

 

One day I was at home and getting ready to eat and there was a really long line so I was on the phone with @ LOCATION1 and @ PERSON1 we were talking about the @ CAPS1 test so I said @ CAPS2 why does it take forever then they told me to be patient and until it's time to order then i said what does patient mean they said it means understand and be tolerant and not complain so I said I could try that and then before you know I was sitting at a table eating and on the phone at Red Hobster. So now I know that whenever I go somewhere with long lines all I have to do is be much more patient and not complain.

It's a story about when I was patient. My family was planning a camping trip to go up @ LOCATION1. There was a huge campground where you can reserve an area and camp there. The bad part was that it was around @ NUM1 hours. So I wrapped up a magazine, some paper my @ CAPS1 and decided on the best. My sister and I @ PERSON1 were playing each other @ LOCATION2 for about an hour, but since @ CAPS4 was playing, all I could think of was camp. Later I was looking at a magazine on the campsite, I had no idea it was on the campsite at first which made me more excited. Then I drew pictures for about half an hour, it was fun. I ended up taking a nap for another half hour. When I woke up I was staring wide-eyed at the road, constantly thinking of camp. Finally @ CAPS2 said that @ CAPS4 are here kids ! " " @ CAPS3 ! " @ CAPS4 all @ CAPS5. @ CAPS4 set up camp, played on the playground, went swimming and built a bonfire. The whole wait was worth it. But the return home seemed much quicker. It's the story of a time when I was patient

Hi, I am writing on the subject patience. I think patience is very important to the world. Because if no one had patience, everyone would go crazy like banshees and go crazy all the time. It's important to have patients because in life it's not always fair and you have to wait your turn. For example, when I go to get my allergy shot, I have to be patient. Because other people have @ CAPS1 first and act to get served first. I also have to be patient in my soccer games because everyone has to play, and I can play in @ CAPS1 spot the whole game. Many people who are not patient make others not patient. Another term for non-patient is hospitalized. Everyone must have some kind of patience. That's what this world needs, a little more patience. THE @ CAPS2.

This is the story of a time when my mother was patient. My mom and I were at the clinic once ?? to get my medicine. We were one of the first people there. Then a lot more people started coming. My mom thought we were the first people to be called, we weren't @ NUM1 groups where we called, then @ NUM1 other groups were called. @ NUM3 other groups have been called. Then my mom and I were finally called and that was the story of when my mom was a patient.

Have you ever learned to spritarnt a single trick in your life. I left ??? you about it. One day I was also at home watching. All of a sudden, I must have used the toilet really badly. Unfortunately, my mother and sisters had to leave. My mom went first and my sister the next. My mom didn't take very long but my sister was there during this time and I got mad but still waited patiently. He was holding him back but I finally knew I knew he would come out eventually, but I was just waiting. I was doing my best to get into the bathroom. I knocked on the door just trying to back away and waited in the bathroom and minded my own business. In conclusion, I have been patient for a while.

Patience is a virtue. It is something that we all need in life. Without it, we cannot do anything with this patience. People would get boring because they don't have patience. Now here is a time where I have been patient. After @ DATE1, I decided to buy on ipod touch. As no stores were open, I had only one other option. Online shopping. I used omazon to get it. I couldn't wait to do it again ! Unfortunately I had to wait a week to get it. It was boring to wait for him, but I had other things to occupy. When it finally happened, I was so happy! I was glad I waited. From patience, I learned that you cannot take everything, I learned that people who wait, good things will come to them. Plus, I was better at expecting everything. This is how I was patient and how I managed to be patient better.

During @ DATE2, @ DATE1 to be exact, my family and I want to see fireworks at a local park. It was time for me and my brother to visit all my friends, we were so excited ?? ?? me only an hour to get there. I was so patient because I knew that if I wasn't, my mom wouldn't be in a good mood. " Is it already ?" " My brother groaned. "@ CAPS1 my @ CAPS2, @ PERSON1 we just got in the car." I said my brother has always been important, of course I didn't say a word on the way and everything he said, the trip seemed longer.

Patience is very important in life. I have been patient several times a day. I'll tell you about a time when I was patient and it paid off. It was @ DATE1, exactly two edits before my birthday. I went to my mom and asked if I could get a phone. She said I was too young and didn't have a phone until she was in college. I told him that everyone had a cell phone except me, that was partly true. She told me she would and if I bugged her again she wouldn't get me a phone. It was @ DATE3 now, just @ NUM1 more days before my birthday. I thought about what type of phone I wanted, I thought about what shell color I would get for it. I thought about this phone for weeks. Then the day came, it was @ DATE2, my birthday. I woke up in the morning to the smell of pancakes. After we had eaten we went to my grandmother's, as it was also thanksgiving. After dinner we returned home for my birthday surprise. I opened my urgent aunts, uncles, grandparents, then the last box. I opened it, it was my phone. I was so excited that I called all of my friends on my new phone. It was the best birthday ever. It's a good thing to be patient because I was patient, I got the phone I wanted. That is why you should always be patient and wait. Through; @ PERSON1.

One day, when I was home alone, I felt that no one was with me. I was home alone because my uncle was very sick and my parents and parents went to visit him. I was very scared and felt that @ CAPS1 had left me. So I prayed and prayed but fell or heard nothing back. So I fell asleep and heard @ CAPS2's voice, he was talking to me! I was running in a field of grass. I saw a man dressed from where to hang out and when he got out of the mud there was no or no more seating on him. I ran to him and asked him " man who are you ? " He answered and said" child of @ CAPS1 why do you look so alone ? I am your angel, I came to tell you what your father said, "He talked to me for a long time, i no longer felt scared or lonely, there was a cloud in the sky he said he had to go but he was my gurdian angle. After that he got in the floor. I will not forget him never, he's my angle. And that was the time I needed to have patience to hear @ CAPS4's voice.

The time I was patient was when Christmas was coming. At first I just wanted Christmas to come here. But my mom told me I just had to wait and it would happen soon. So I waited and waited because I really wanted a Wii console and the @ NUM1 sims. So finally when Christmases came, I got what I wanted and some. Usually @ CAPS1 isn't that patient, but the reason I was is because my mom told me it would happen soon. I've learned that when you really want something or really want to do something, the more patient you are, the faster it will come.

Every day I have this kid sitting next to me on the bus. He's annoying every day but I listen to him anyway. We got used to it and a long time but we debated things sometimes. He tells a story of rage about @ CAPS1 and snipers. He's not really my friend but he is one to talk to. I think if I listen and talk to this kid, it's a mission sent by God because he doesn't have many friends.

Have you ever been patient? I believe we should be patience. I think patience is something weall need in the futher. You can be patience at the fair, in the lunch line, and when your teacher a dog rides .I'm going to talk about patience at the fair. You have to be patient at the fair. When you stand in line for the rides, you have to be patient. When you buy tickets or a bradet, you have to be patient. This is one way you have to be patient. You have to be patient. We're all going to eat, so we should wait. I have people with me all the time, they didn't have patience . you need a lot of patience. You can't expect a dog to know any tricks @ CAPS1 works in progress. You have to be slow and patient. This is why you have to be patient. have lunch and teach a dog tricks. At the fair you have to be patient. In school, you need patience. At home, you need patience. That is why p attention is important.

Patience is something people sometimes don't have. I know I did it once. And I'll tell you about it. It was a beautiful sunny day. All of my family were outside. My dad made hot dogs and hamburgers on the grill. My mother was setting the table. And me and my brother playing wrestling with a soccer ball. We all knew how to throw and catch a soccer ball, but my little brother didn't. Considering the fact that we have all been chosen to teach my little brother. We tried once, we tried twice, but he just didn't get it. Eventually all my sisters got tired of explaining the purpose of the game to her, so they gave up. Me on the other side said it over and over until he got it. Myself, I got tired of telling him what to do. But then I thought, 'Give the kid a chance, he might just have it' so I kept helping him. "@ CAPS1 is ready! Come inside," my mother had shouted. "It's @ CAPS1 time let's go inside" I tell my little brother. "@ CAPS2! Just one last time, I promise I'll get it!" he apologized. “@ CAPS3, but just once,” I replied. Even though he had said that for the last few hundred times he had tried, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do it again. As I let go of the ball from my hands, my brother rushed over and grabbed it! After he grabbed him he yelled "I did it" and I looked at him proudly and said "good job" he ran inside to tell my parents he was doing it. 'had finally caught. I was really happy that I took the time to help her. I knew he could do it @ CAPS2 no matter how many times I tried or he tried. I knew he would get it soon. And he did! And that's when I was patient.

My brothers' exam was today, why did I come? All I did was sit patiently for @ NUM1, there was nothing I could do @ CAPS1 I kept my cool. Waiting there in a dark room was difficult, I picked up a magazine near the car and started flipping through it, @ CAPS1 the interesting thing was an article about a new @ CAPS2 coming out. I read that in @ NUM2 I went to the bathroom and very quickly returned to the desert of darkness. I pulled out my phone and texted a few people. Five minutes have passed and I say no, I close my eyes and lay my head back so I waited and waited. Just as I was about to bang my head against a brick wall, my brother walks into the room and says " This is it ".

The time I was patient was when I was snowing with my family. Cause my dad and I have to worm them and get them off the track and start them and he has to take a turn and find us a track and I roll back him on the other sled and I have to put the Geon snow on and this not, we go to my aunt's and aunt's house at @ LOCATION1, I have been to a lot of places on the sleds.

This is the time when I was patient with my friend @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 and I live in the same building, so we hang out all the time. One day I got a @ CAPS1 to go to the carnival. I noticed she didn't like the @ CAPS1 as she said "she was afraid" of roller coasters, but I told her it wouldn't be a big deal, we won't go on big rides . On carnival day I was excited just like @ PERSON1 when we got there she was really scared to do the rides so I told her we could do the smaller of the rides. After we went oh a few, she wasn't so scared. As the wall, we were walking, she saw a merry-go-round, one of the biggest rides there, she said we should keep going so I told her if she wanted to we could go, and she was sure after this ride we kept doing different bigger rides, the wall we were walking on, she said thank you for being patient and i was a good friend. In short, it was the time when I had patience for a friend.

There were times in my life when I had to be patient. My friends and I decided that day to go to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS1. I love roller coasters, but I hate the lines that come with them. When we got there we had to wait half an hour to get in. When we made the decision to take the @ CAPS2 route first. Then we had to wait another @ NUM1 minutes to get on the ride. The other rides we want too have had a long wait. So throughout the day there was a lot of waiting. Even when we got food we had to wait with all this waiting, it took a lot of patience. My friend and I had to be understanding and tolerant of the wait and the long lines. By the end of the day, we had all grown used to using our patience. This trip to @ LOCATION1 @ CAPS3 taught me to be a more patient person.

Patience, the engines roared, the propellers were turning, the plane was advancing, towards the runway. Everyone applauded. Then we heard a loud creak and the plane stopped. We sat there for over an hour. Finally, the pilot got on the intercom and told us to collect our bags, get out of the plane and go back to @ LOCATION2. At that point, I was on the verge of losing my patience, but I kept it. Why? Well it all started at @ LOCATION2. I never really liked airplanes. However, when I heard that we were going to @ LOCATION1, @ LOCATION3 from @ LOCATION4, I gladly took a plane rather than a long drive. We boarded the plane at @ LOCATION2 through gate @ NUM1. The plane took off quickly and we were flying. I was a little confused when we landed @ NUM2 minutes later at @ LOCATION5. Thought we were going to @ LOCATION3 ! Turns out we had a two hour layover at @ LOCATION5. I had to sit down and be patient for two hours. I was really excited to go to @ LOCATION3 and I hate to sit and wait. Two hours later, we discovered that our flight had been delayed for an hour. We sat down and waited until we finally got on the plane. As we started to move forward, the wing tip of the plane caught on the side of the building and broke. The flight attendants helped us unload the plane. I noticed all the cranky faces of the people who wanted to continue the flight. I have a reed with them but I tried to be patient. After three hours of intense waiting, the plane was fixed and we left. I knew if I hadn't been patient I wouldn't have made the long trip to @ LOCATION3.

Once I was sent to my room, I also sat on my bed and was able @ CAPS1 to do anything. I ask once to go out and it adds time. So for about an hour and a half I have to sit in my room. I took a nap for about twenty minutes. I was so on edge and then he ended up leaving the meat.

It's a story where I was patient. I believed in aIons. So I went to a field and I set down and waited for them. I was about @ NUM1 years old. So I decided to go there, I'm there just waiting and waiting. Then I saw something, my God, it's just a shooting star. I had existed so much but it wasn't. All of a sudden I saw a deer and it was running after me. So I pulled it. So I was waiting I was waiting. I was bored so I composed a song. I am waiting for the aIeons yes I am waiting yes I am. When it got dark, I saw something. It was the icons. the spaceship stops on the ground. The aIeons came out and shot them all down. Then took them to their home and showed them to the hole city. They didn't believe me and I told them to go to the field and look at the spaceship and they all passed out. It was a time when I was patient.

Patient; When arriving at ceader point, there was a route he was waiting to continue, it is the @ CAPS1. The only problem is that this is a @ NUM1 hour wait. Standing there under the scorching sun on @ NUM2 @ CAPS2 days , I had my doubts . Looking up and seeing the light and @ CAPS3 tough shades of green truck if the ??? I knew it was worth it. After @ NUM3 minutes @ PERSON1 my brother was all ready on board. So we played @ NUM4 @ CAPS4 to pass the time. I wore it every time. Almost an hour later we come to the first pop and mageen hit. I get three pops and about @ NUM5 cany bars @ PERSON1 has doubled around me. Two hours later we got to the elevator, the mouse took us up the ??? At the top, they tie us to the front row seat! What luck. Crank! Crank! Crank! I went to roller to slowly climb the hill. Then our own cart dived and we were @ CAPS2 at NUM5 miles an hour as we went up, down, side to side, me at the top of the site ??? three minutes. When we finally pulled back to the station, @ PERSON1 had sent @ NUM1 times and ??? Getting my group back to the car we started the @ NUM8 hour car ride home and I turned to my brother and told him it was another one so my own set of @ NUM4 @ CAPS5 has begun.

When I was ten, my mother promised me a phone. But then, her, I had to wait until @ CAPS1. It made me angry because @ CAPS1 was only next month. I couldn't wait because this phone was a touchscreen with a keypad. But I tried to be as patient as possible. The next day I continued to see those commercials from the phone I wanted. It was very hard to be patient but I did my best. So every day I had to try and focus on something other than the phone. Also, a few of my other friends had phones and I really wanted to text them. Before I knew it there was only a week left until @ CAPS1 so I was excited even though I had to pay the phone bill. I just wish the time had flown by, but it's not. So all I decided to do was wait. After six days, tomorrow was already @ CAPS1! My days of miserable waiting have paid off! So I woke up the next day and opened my gift and it was a brand new phone! My heart began to beat with excitement. I was so happy that I thanked my mother. So being patient will pay off in the end.

When I was in fourth grade, I went to a concert and had to be very patient. I was waiting in a long line to enter. While I was in line I started talking to my friends, we played games and took a few steps every minute. I sat there and walked with my mom and sat down again and felt like the line wasn't moving at all ! Finally we got up in the front and my friends and I were so excited. Being patient paid off because if I had bothered my mother too much, she could have attacked me. I had a lot of fun after going into concert. It was a time when I was patient.

Patience is used when people are in no rush to get to where they are going. Like check in store or at work, some people may be rood and not use their patience in school and work, you should always use your patience, like for example use my patience in kinchat school because there has more than one hand @ NUM1 the graders and half of them are bushy at lunchtime and the other half get hurt and they @ CAPS1 don't know what to do.

Patience is a virtue that I have always wanted. Sometimes I lose my patience when something takes too long. In @ ORGANIZATION1 seriously, there was an event called @ CAPS1. It was increasing and a lot of people wanted to see if @ CAPS2 would close. The rain stopped inoculently, but I had to wait @ TIME1. It was only six for! So in other words, my family and I had to stand and wait two hours and thirty minutes. The two hours seemed to last forever. It was incredible torture! My brother kept annoying us with squeaking noises in the queue. My brother had to be berated three times before he stopped! Eventually they let us in at @ TIME2, and we had soft drinks and hot dogs. We found our seats and started looking. Man, I'm glad I was patient enough. The show was worth the wait.

"@ CAPS1 kids. Today @ CAPS10 will be looking at our microscopes. I will choose your partners. @ CAPS5 @ PERSON1. @ PERSON1 chose @ CAPS2 to be my partner. I think she is really smart. @ CAPS10 were assigned under the microscope. "The teacher told us that @ CAPS10 should draw whatever @ CAPS10 sees in our notebooks. @ CAPS2 looked into the microscope and saw blue lines scattered all over. " @ CAPS3, then- I see ? ” I asked. “ @ CAPS4, I have to draw it in my notebook. ” @ CAPS5 @ CAPS2. “ @ CAPS1, @ CAPS17 Hurry. ” I @ CAPS5, not noticing that I was impatient . "@ CAPS8, who can accept @ PERSON3 into their group? He needs a partner. @ CAPS5 @ PERSON1. @ CAPS2 looked up from the microscope and raised his hand. " @ CAPS10 can! " @ CAPS5 @ CAPS2. "@ CAPS12 ! Really @ CAPS2 ? " I complained. “@ PERSON2, don't be rude. You know it's new in our @ CAPS8. @ CAPS5 @ PERSON1. @ PERSON3 walked over, took a chair and sat down right in front of me. He was patiently waiting for @ CAPS2 to draw what she saw in her notebook. " @ CAPS2, can you slow down ? " I shouted. "@ CAPS17, can you shout louder ?" she cried back. Finally, it was @ PERSON3's turn. He looked at the microscope and started to draw. I tried to take a look at the paper from @ CAPS2. She noticed it and I glanced back quickly. “@ PERSON2, you really must @ CAPS4 in your turn and be patient. @ CAPS10 will all have a chance to go through it. @ CAPS2 @ CAPS5 for me. ” You are right. Thank you @ CAPS2. I'm sorry I acted like this. I @ CAPS5. "It's okay, I act like that too, @ CAPS3, maybe @ CAPS10 should all sit down for lunch." @ CAPS5 @ CAPS2.

Being patient is sometimes difficult, but sometimes you don't care. There are several times that I have been patient. Sometimes I have to wait an hour or @ NUM1 minutes. There was a time when I had to wait an hour. The only time I was patient was dancing. My mom danced me at @ NUM2. I waited five minutes because I was a bit annual. After waiting five minutes, I was worried they might be in another class, but no, they weren't. After waiting thirty minutes I was really bored and remembered that the dancing had started at @ TIME1. I could have called home but I didn't have my phone. Then when five more minutes had passed, I went into the play set. Me and I swinging on our own. When I was @ TIME1 my mom picked me up from the dance but I told her, “ It starts at @ TIME1. So I have to go ”. She kept asking me why I hadn't called and I kept telling her that I didn't have my phone. Then she left and I went dancing for two hours. To be patient for that long is humble for me. I can last fifteen minutes but I cannot last an hour. It was one of the horrible times I was patient.

I was patient when I had to wizard @ NUM1 little bad girls at my sisters. My sister asked me if I wanted to take @ TIME1. I did, then his divine children came. This sister from @ TIME1 was reminding that she had to go. So that morning she left me with the kids for @ NUM2 hours. So I had to patiently wait for her to come back. Finally, she did.

One day I had to wait about @ NUM1 hours, which seemed like a year, but I didn't complain. I sat in the doctor's office waiting to be called, set there and waited with my mom. I sat down and read a magazine while my mom hid her friend. About three people were called in forty-five minutes. But I sat down and looked at the magazine. They named a kid named @ PERSON1, and I thought it was me because my name was @ PERSON2. I finished my magazine and moved on to the next one. I thought I would like it because there was war on the front of the blanket, but it's just a blanket nothing cool inside except a floating tranlula thing. About an hour passed and only five people were called. I finally finished all the magazines and was bored. I watched the people being called and called eventually there was just my mother and I and another group, and of course they were called before us. It took us about three hours to get called, and when we did we had to wait even longer because they were having technical issues with their machines. When we entered we had to wait half an hour for the doctor. But we got in, he made my knee tremble then made me jump on one foot, why I don't know. But he used to put the stuff that goes in my ear and the thermometer that goes on my tongue. But we finally got out and went home. My mom asked me how I could be so patient and I said, " I have no idea ."

When I went to the doctor, I had to be patient. I went there because my aunt's driveway had a crack. And I was driving my scooter. I had to not be careful because of my scooter. I had hit the crack so I jumped the knee. So my father came out of the house to look for me. I had to put myself in a wheelchair. And wait because there were no more curtains. I waited an hour and then I had my turn. And they checked my knee. Then they gave me chounces to walk. It was quite difficult to climb the stairs to my house.

I was patient as I was on my way to @ LOCATION1 to see my @ CAPS1. I was patient because I didn't want to be really excited about @ CAPS2. So I stayed on the call "and we were in the car a little further, then my brother forgot something and we had to go back and have @ CAPS2 and I was patient about @ CAPS2 ,? ?? we were silent all the way that I got the story when I was very patient to go to @ LOCATION1.

Have you or your parents already sent an application for a job? Well my uncle did and was very patient about it. He wanted this job more than a kid wanted ice cream. One day my uncle typed in a request for the job he wanted. When he was done, he copied and pasted it for an email. When he hit send, he hurried and grabbed his phone in the hopes of getting the job. He looked at his phone as soon as he got up to make sure there were no missed calls or messages. He knew he had to be patient. He was still waiting for the @ CAPS2 call, still nothing. It had been a week and he thought to call the place @ CAPS2 that he had not. Then he got a phone call that afternoon, so he quickly ran like a cheetah to retrieve his phone. I was just my mom asking him if he got the @ CAPS2 job all he said was no with a sigh. I felt bad for the poor guy for not knowing for another day. The next morning he got a call and he picked up the hook shouting : “ @ CAPS1 do you want ! " @ CAPS2 not knowing that was the boss for the job. So he apologized and got the job as well. He was so happy to know that he had waited patiently forever and got the job he wanted. When he went to work at his new job he really liked the way he got it and now he knew you always knew to be patient and that everything will be fine. So now, always knowing to be patient, it doesn't matter @ CAPS1 the deal is. My uncle @ MONTH1 is not an @ CAPS2 expert, he should be now. Again, remember to always be patient and good things will come to you.
